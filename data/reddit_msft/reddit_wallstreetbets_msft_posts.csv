"I believe Microsoft (MSFT) is prepping Lumen (LUMN) for an acquisition.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18fn1n6/i_believe_microsoft_msft_is_prepping_lumen_lumn/";"Hello Readers,   MobyDick4Real here, and I am going to dissect why I believe Microsoft is prepping Lumen Technologies for a acquisition.  To begin, I was a former employee of Lumen Technologies for just under 5 years. I was part of the Federal team, and it was my responsibility to price-to-win RFP's in the communications and technology sector. During my tenure, I was part of the team that secured the IPTS win which is a $1.5B sole contract awarded to Lumen.  During this time, I watched the stock sink from about $15 to less than a dollar, and currently own 4% of the call options expiring January 1st 2026. This may sound like a lot, but its $1,000 worth of $5 strike options.   Lumens stock has been in steady decline since Jeff Storey took the helm about 5 years ago, but was anchored around $7 due to the ridiculous dividend they were paying ($0.25 a quarter). After his retirement there was internal chatter of whether Laurinda Pang, or Ed Morche was going to replace Jeff during his departure. However, to the companies surprise an outsider was awarded the position and took leadership.   Kate Johnson is a tenured executive that was previously a Vice President at Microsoft. Her bread and butter was subscription based modeling at Microsoft, and headed major projects. After winning the CEO position at Lumen: Kate slowly fired off all the executives of Lumen besides two people: Andrew Dugan, and Chris Stansbury and proceeded to fill the positions with Microsoft alumni and other colleagues from her days at Warton.   First thing Kate did was remove the dividend, and sold off Lumens LATAM and EMEA offerings: sizably reducing Lumens debt, and bolstering free cash flow. Bears say that Lumens primary sales are coming from landline phones and other legacy services, and I believe this to be a fallacy.    Lumen can be easily broken into two major teams that derive most of the large wins. The Hyperscalers team (Enterprise) and the DoD team (Fed). For the sake of this conversation I am going to focus on the Federal team. Lumen was created after a merger between Level3 and CenturyLink. Where CenturyLink focused on enterprise sales, and Level3 ran the majority of the DoD network.   Microsoft has recently bolstered their view on supporting government contracts, and has done so by crafting Zero Trust infrastructure into their cloud offerings, and getting Teams on just about every government computer there is.   My hypothesis is Microsoft wants to further their hold in the defense sectors and plans to do so by acquiring Lumen. Lumen is a consortium member of every large undersea cable and provides most of the layer 1 transport to the government. Having Microsoft purchase Lumen immediately puts them in a position to win massive multi-billion dollar contracts, and overlay their technology as a value add. This then provides the government with an easy button to not only purchase their data infrastructure but to have all the bells and whistles Microsoft provides included seamlessly. If there is one thing I learned working Fed, is that the government loves an easy button.   Lumens goal for both enterprise and fed is to create a subscription based model referred to as network as a service (NaaS) and this allows their hyperscalers and larger accounts to add and reduce bandwidth across their business within a few clicks. Insert the Queen of subscription based modeling.   As quantum computing and quantum fiber become more prevalent Lumen is perfectly positioned to have massive growth seizing the workload for all autonomous vehicles, AI, 5G, quantum computing, and any large data transfers across the US.   Regarding the sell-offs of LATAM and EMEA, the deals were structured that the companies that purchased them (Colt Telecom, and Cirion Telecom) would still supply the company with all required needs on the fiber that was sold. This allows Lumen to be a global business without having to manage their global fiber footprint.   Lumen is capable of pivoting and creating dense datasets due to the fact they have direct access to 70% of all global internet traffic, and have vision into another 10% through peering agreements. This gives them access to 80% of all global internet traffic. This would dramatically increase Microsofts AI offerings, and could make all their selling efforts more affective.   By Microsoft purchasing Lumen, their security, AI, government, enterprise, and all data transfer offerings would be dramatically improved based off the information they could feed into it.  Lumen stock is currently sitting around $1.40, and makes about $15-$20B a year with a gross profit of about $7B in 2023. The business has been in decline profit wise for about 5 years, but this is due to major sell-offs and securing future business.   For the reasons of Microsoft executives taking the helm, cutting off the deadweight sectors, rumors of the merger in the industry, and the overlap between the two companies. I believe Microsoft is likely to purchase Lumen for pennies on the dollar in the upcoming years.   But who knows, maybe I'm just regarded.  &#x200B:";"2928";"2023-12-11T06:16:48"
"Musk’s Lawsuit vs Open AI/Microsoft Says Some Crazy Shit";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bdgcvv/musks_lawsuit_vs_open_aimicrosoft_says_some_crazy/";"If you haven’t read it you definitely should because it’s going to be the center piece for AI legislation and could cost Microsoft a kings ransom.  Musk wants a jury to decide if the models built by Open AI have achieved AGI. If they have then that would be outside the terms of Microsoft’s license with Open AI.  That sucks because it’s already aced the bar exam and a bunch of other shit so I don’t think you need a jury for that.  But that’s nothing compared to this project Q Star they have been working on. That’s the one where we find out if we will be turned into paper clips soon.   The lawsuit hints at a major breakthrough that occurred at the time the Board decided to fire Altman.  That was when Microsoft stuck their wang in and replaced the Board of AI experts with a bunch of yeah sures and then gave the green light to go out and raise trillions from foreign investors.   This is going to be the lawsuit of the century and if Musk doesn’t win we are all fucked.   That would be great for Microsoft so make sure you buy a bunch of calls before the announcement if that happens. ";"364";"2024-03-13T03:36:30"

"Part 2 - I believe Microsoft (MSFT) is prepping Lumen (LUMN) for an acquisition.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1af84b8/part_2_i_believe_microsoft_msft_is_prepping_lumen/";"Welcome back my fellow regards and degenerates. Hope everyone had a great holiday season and is getting situated in the new year.  Regarding Lumen it has been quite the rollercoaster since we last spoke. My calls and shares almost doubled when the stock neared $2, but have been humbled on the decent back to $1.30. Since then I have had a chance to dive more into their stock news, have discussions with businesses across the industry, and have stumbled on news that impacts just about every tech business on earth regarding bottlenecks to growth. This is going to be a long discussion as always.  In short, I believe Lumen is decreasing their debt and parting out legacy chunks of their business for a behemoth like Microsoft to come in and gobble them up. Why? Because their infrastructure, physical assets, and network can be transitioned into whatever Microsoft needs and writing a $10-$20B check is nothing to a tech giant like them. Every physical Lumen location could be easily transitioned into a point of presence (POP) or an edge facility for any of the numerous SaaS or physical products that Microsofts sells. Lumen (the Level3 side) also owns numerous contract vehicles within the government space, giving Microsoft unique access to Fed contracts they didn't have before.  &#x200B:  This is a pit stop for the tl:dr boys, see you on the other side.  &#x200B:  To get this started I am going to discuss some brief Lumen news, rumors and topics the industry believes, and wrap it up into how I think Lumen is uniquely positioned for the industry strangulation that is about to occur. I will discuss the bottlenecks and provide speculation on how the obstacles will be handled.  First things first Lumen rebranded, again... They're orange now: why? I am not sure but they are. Next Lumen has effectively fired \~15,000 employees without anyone blowing a whistle on such a decline over the past few years. Very impressive Kate, but too bad it didn't work the same with UPS: womp womp.  Lumen recently restructured their debt TSA' allowing them access to $1.325B long term debt, and delaying the strain of $12.5B of their current debt. Freeing up this strangle will allow the business to maneuver much easier without banks putting a damper on everything, but they're not out of the woods yet.  Lumen is going all in on NaaS and Quantum Fiber. They received certifications at the CES 2024 show in Vegas for two WiFi-7 devices (golf clap). This may seem dumb, but this is actually huge for the future growth of WiFi, and they've recently hired Satish Lakshmanan who is a AI wizard and the new Chief Product executive. Satish is likely going to innovate the product suite with AI buzzwords and fire off more redundant staff along the way.  This doesn't look like a company that is consolidating its losses, and preparing to die. The noose around their neck has been loosened by the banks, they're reducing their operating costs, and they're innovating their offerings for future demand: which will be important in our last segment.  Before we get there, lets talk about the rumors on the street.  The bulk of the industry doesn't thinks Lumen can turn this around, and I agree with them to a certain degree. That is why I see a acquisition in the future, this is common in the telecom industry, and has happened numerous times. I don't see why a good thing like acquisitions would suddenly stop, especially since banks are waking up and are starting to spend the cash they've been hoarding during the recent economic down turn. The difference is I see Lumen adapting to their current situation whereas giants like Verizon and AT&T are focusing on the same old.  &#x200B:  Lumen does have something a lot of companies want though, and that is physical fiber and this brings me to my last segment. The bottlenecks that will soon plague the tech space, and will require a huge lift to fix. These bottlenecks cover the entire industry vertical and absolutely will impact your life. How fast is happens is up for debate but I could see it happening as fast as 5 years, but will be a common discussion within 10-20 years.  The bottlenecks are:  1. Regulatory 2. Interconnectivity (Fiber, Copper, Radio, etc.) 3. Datacenters (Power Consumption) 4. Energy Companies (Energy Generation)  I am going to start from the ground up, so energy generation. There is no amount of renewable energy that can sustain human tech in the near future. The only way to generate enough will be nuclear energy. There is no ifs, ands, or buts: nuclear power will be utilized to meet industry needs, and I have already heard numerous telecom, datacenter, and investor executives starting to talk about it.  To put into perspective a current rack at a datacenter is usually outfitted with maybe 5 kW of energy, and upwards of 10-12 kW per rack on a good day (a really good day). A fully functioning AI setup with all the bells and whistles will require closer to 60 kW of energy per rack. A more modest AI rack will pull 30 to 40 kW if they aren't using all the latest and greatest equipment.   Datacenters are going to have to overhaul all their equipment, and allow more power to get into their racks, this is going to take time and depending on the Datacenter company it will mean make or break for some of them. Personally I think Digital Realty is doing a great job of getting ahead of this, if you are curious about a DC I recommend. However, some hubs like Singapore are getting maxed out due to strict regulation. Physical assets can only expand so far.  This brings us to that pesky interconnectivity we were discussing and this is something the industry is very split on at the moment. Currently there is a lot of interconnectivity between various locations across the globe, and Lumen owns a good chunk of it. Most of the major cities have a hub of sorts, and if you're familiar with the industry you're thinking about Singapore, Tokyo, Northern Virginia, Los Angeles, London, and a handful more of places.   The issue is these connections are starting to get maxed out. There is a terminology called bursting where they are able to fit more information on a fiber asset than it can handle. In short, we're putting 10 lbs of potatoes in a 5 lb bag. The issue is there is no incentives for building more fiber. Previously the government incentivized fiber buildouts and a lot of the companies were able to do these massive build outs for free. This is not the case anymore, and the cost and time delay for these buildouts are large if you're building undersea cables and traversing the globe. If by some chance you do pull a profit, you are making fractions of pennies per dollar spent, and you're waiting 5+ years to get these cables up and running. Very few companies are building fiber assets today, AT&T I think is the only one I've heard of recently, but its all local city fiber. Eventually the interconnectivity assets will be more valuable since demand will be high and supply will be low, and this will require regulatory restrictions across the whole vertical to be relaxed.   If not, companies will seize these connections from public use, and control the traffic that is allowed on them.   Essentially laws and regulations are going to have to be eased up to progress forward. In the Philippines they have ""gray outs"" where the government will shut off the internet momentarily to ease up on traffic congestion. This is not a unique occurrence around the world, but if it ever happens to America: there would be full blown riots.   I think the traffic congestion will cause political pressure, and the lawmakers will have to alleviate nuclear regulations to provide enough energy for the world. The increase in energy we discussed is just in AI equipment at DC', it doesn't account for the electric car grid, crypto, or any of the other massive energy sucks our community has. Nuclear is the only clear action forward, once those restrictions are removed our DC' will be able to provide ample energy, and this will spur new growth across the globe.   Companies like Lumen are positioned to make a killing when interconnectivity is once again a profitable business. I still believe a merger is likely in the next few years, and to say it bluntly: I like the stock.   As always do your own research and make your own decisions on the matter, but due to the changes the company is making, and the industry constraints of the near future. I believe this stock is uniquely positioned to blow tf up due to an acquisition. Of all the large companies able to gobble Lumen up, I think Microsoft would have the most to gain from it's offerings.     But who knows, maybe I'm just regarded.  &#x200B:";"56";"2024-01-31T04:34:51"

"The Big Bet: Going Bullish on Google and Bearish on Microsoft";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1b6jrtu/the_big_bet_going_bullish_on_google_and_bearish/";"Hey fellow degenerates,  I’m contemplating a bold move and would love to get your takes. I’m eyeing Google ($GOOGL) for a bullish play with Call options and Microsoft ($MSFT) for a bearish stance through Put options.  Here’s my rationale:  Google ($GOOGL) Calls: Despite recent flak over Gemini, their new but controversial LLM, I’m betting on Google’s comeback. The uproar was over Gemini producing some, let’s say, “creative” outputs (think: Pope imagery gone wild). Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founder, stepped out of his semi-retirement to steer the ship right, signaling a serious clean-up and commitment to excellence. Given Google’s unmatched data access (YouTube, Reddit data deals), I believe they’re uniquely positioned to refine and dominate the LLM space. This fiasco, while a setback, could be the wake-up call needed to spur significant positive changes, making Google a stronger contender in the AI race, especially against the backdrop of OpenAI and ChatGPT shaking up the traditional search model. “Why search when you can find?” - LLMs might just be the answer, and Google’s poised to capitalize on this paradigm shift.  Microsoft ($MSFT) Puts: On the flip side, I’m skeptical about Microsoft’s current trajectory. Copilot, their latest foray into AI, seems more gimmick than game-changer based on user feedback and practical utility. Beyond Teams and Copilot, I’m hard-pressed to find compelling innovations that could drive Microsoft’s value higher. The market’s enthusiasm for Microsoft, especially following its rally post-Nvidia, feels overblown. I suspect their AI offerings won’t be enough to sustain their recent growth, making them a prime candidate for a bearish bet.  So, I’m all in on Google thriving through its AI pivot and Microsoft facing headwinds with its AI initiatives. But, what do you think? Am I missing anything critical about Google’s prospects or overlooking potential upside in Microsoft’s strategy?  Change my mind or back me up, but either way, let’s hear those hot takes!";"27";"2024-03-04T20:29:15"

Ilya's days could be numbered: [https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/18/23967199/breaking-openai-board-in-discussions-with-sam-altman-to-return-as-ceo](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/18/23967199/breaking-openai-board-in-discussions-with-sam-altman-to-return-as-ceo)  **Original Post**: This story is made for an epic Apple TV+ drama. On one side you have the Y-Combinator entrepreneurs and innovator Sam Altman and on the other side is an enigmatic figure that believes strongly that AGI should be in the hands of humanity. Not corporations.  The quote from Winston Churchill comes to mind "" If you're not a liberal at twenty you have no heart, if you're not a conservative at forty, you have no brain."" Politics aside, this guy (Ilya) is in between having a heart and no brain.  First and foremost, there was no reason to fire Sam in the coup manner he did this past Friday afternoon. I've read it all, i've listened to it all. There was really no good reason.  Secondly, and probably most importantly is the notion that OpenAI runs as a non-profit is a bunch of bullshit. You have developers making millions in salary and stock options which whether it is in private equity or not you are literally saying that one day you're going to be publicly listed and boom everyone is going to get some massive payout. Should a company that is going to have a public payout be allowed to be considered a ""non-profit."" It just doesn't make any sense.  Next, the ideology of Ilya Sutskever is ultra concerning for me. This guy is really trying to pull off the greatest stunt known to mankind. And the board, all 3 of the other members beside Sam and Greg, should be RIPPED for this. Microsoft not being on the board should be RIPPED for this.  You have this weird, the ""1st of its kind,"" corporate structure of a capped investment. All over the comments people are trying to excuse and explain that ""this is what it means"" and ""everyone knew it"" and ""it's all public information."" As a side note, I've never thought about the importance of the board except other than the firing of Steve Jobs from Apple (At least they had some good reason that wasn't about something stupid: they were pissed they weren't making profit.)  What they're trying to say with a capped investment is that until we make AGI or repay in profits or some bullshit agreement rider is that you have only so much to gain until we OpenAI take back full and unfettered control of the company. To hell with your original 49% investment at some point it will be all ours. And somehow, this ties into being a non-profit we're going to send all of our profit and money AFTER YOU KNOW we pay ourselves million of dollars per year in salaries and then give the rest to non-profit's such as the ""black girls code fund.""  Koombaya!!! Hippy Dippy! Sounds like bullshit right? It sounds that way because it is.  As an investor, a user and a person who works in AI and automation I had no earthly clue this timebomb was ticking. That the board members where on some fantasy island of bullshit.  So why was Microsoft so flat footed? Why can Microsoft be so out of the loop?  Well, I think what happened if you read everything correctly and actually listen to what Greg and Same and Ilya are saying you keep hearing over and over again about the ""Safety of AI"" and specifically the Safety of ""AGI"".  What's Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). I work in AI and I can't even tell you what I think it means anymore because it's been so bastardized.  Here's my opinion of what it is and why I think it is such a problem in this situation. Some people when they think about AI they think about a sentient thing. Something that can feel and can think and is ""self-aware"" all on it's own. **The AI god complex issue.** Man created it so who is the god now. All that nonsense. People think of Skynet/terminator, the Matrix, IRobot, Asimov. All of that science fiction stuff. Everyday people that aren't very knowledgeable of the situation may rightly think like this. What happens is that the sentient AI (which is nowhere near coming into existence) is being crept into the believe and understanding of the phrase Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).  Here's the problem and why Ilya should resign or atleast why i'll make a case for it. The problem is, AGI is not sentient AI. AGI for what it is or what it could be has moved the goal post. Everyone has moved this goal post. From Ilya to Sam Altman to Bill Gates to Elon everyone has moved the goal post for AGI. Pay attention because this is how to tie in an LLM into AGI.  Large Language Models. In one sentence. If you take enough text corpus examples and put it into enough compute running neural networks you get coherent responses. That's it folks. It raw brute force compute power. If said thing, is not trained on that said thing it will not show up in your LLM. PERIOD. It can't exist without huge and vast amounts of data and compute power.  So, forget about AGI being the matrix even though we (the AI leadership community) all want to sign an agreement promising that AI won't destroy humanity. I said it was stupid when they signed it and it's even more stupid now that it has come back to bite them in the ass. The new goal post moved AGI isn't sentient it's just more capable. Less hallucinations. I.e. maybe GPT 5. But the delta curve of that is not possibly known as it hasn't be released in masse. And even if it were ""better"" that's great but it's still not going to be able to do anything other than what it has been trained to do.  This is where instead of doomerisym of we won't annihilate the world perhaps Microsoft and tech community would be better served to define what AGI is. If there's a spectrum ok fine but explain that. Because AGI doesn't mean AI models can think and act on their own. They want that magic and mysticism in the public but really look where it just landed you. Time to rethink that stupid public talking point strategy: or they're just too naive to not understand this is how people may think when they hear the word AGI.  Just say that it is a better model, more reliable and has less hallucinations.  Furthermore, they (tech community) want AGI to be this multimodel thing. Still, it has nothing to do with true self-learning self-teaching thought creating AI. It just simply states that there are obvious features in the models and their applications such as memory, handling text, video and audio. Those things don't make it AGI. They simply make it better working AI. Until one day we have the AI that people are thinking of. This ain't it.  That's really the point. Microsoft knows that this just a brute force trained with a lot of data and compute power AI. You can do Dal-E you can do video's, PDF's audio. It's just more and more brute force(tons of data and compute) models. That's in my thinking, why Microsoft agreed to the deal this way. Perhaps they're like well we don't have or won't have AGI (probably not until quantum computing is a thing) so yea whatever you guys. Perhaps the goal post movement of what AGI is. Well, that's were the lawsuits are going to fly I think.  It's literally the wizard of Oz trick. The man behind the curtain is hugging face. lol.  And here's the part that makes Ilya's entire argument (AGI safety for humanity) nonsense. This guy needed all of that compute power he need all of that money and now he wants to pick up his toys and go home ""for the greater good of humanity."" OpenAI could not exist without private equity. They didn't go to Russia and get state funding. They didn't go to the US and get federal funding. They didn't go to China and get that funding. They went right to the US private equity funding mechanisms and specifically Microsoft.  And they put a little rider in the agreement that IF WE ACHIEVE AGI then YOU GET CAPPED. Well, dude you're not at AGI. Nowhere near it. It has been documented and said that current transformer technologies won't be able to create AGI as we are thinking of it. The proper way to think of it. A little bit of SELF-REASONING and Learning and SELF-CREATION. Nowhere fucking near that.  So to Sam and Microsoft why not commercialize this thing that we have now? Why is it crazy that Sam is trying to make money for the company? Why would the board go through the drastic action of firing the CEO for NO GOOD REASON? Not worried about safety. Well, the safety guy quit along with a bunch of other KEY figures. So that argument is out the window. You're own safety guy quit in solidarity of Sam Altman. Just fly's in the face of your stupid safety argument.  Why are we safe? Because these models can not do ANYTHING that they haven't been trained to do. They don't think, they're no sentient, they don't feel or are aware of their existence. AT ALL. And the crazy person who tells that there is something that does this is a KOOK and is probably bat shit crazy.  So, in my opinion this is about power and control and profit versus non-profit and the supposed relation to AGI (which doesn't fucking exist). It's like saying IF god comes back to earth I will change my ways. The man replies ok but i'm going to need you to change your ways now so that WHEN god comes back to earth you have done all the right things now so that you will be ready for him WHEN he comes. Problem is, some of us don't believe in god so...  You can believe (in god/AGI) if you want to but if you put that in an agreement that effectively states when ""GOD/AGI SHOWS UP"" and the people signing the agreement look at you funny and say OK i'll sign that. You can't change the goal post of the definition of god/AGI showing up to make it seem like OMG god/AGI is almost here.  In anyevent, Ilya should resign. He's too unstable to be leading this technology. He thinks he's more important than he is. In follow up, Microsoft needs to get a seat on that damned board. This is a progressing shit show and it would be a lot better if it weren't.

"Potential Trading Opportunity on Microsoft Activision Deal";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/14m73oh/potential_trading_opportunity_on_microsoft/";"On June 22, the Federal Trade Commission and Microsoft began a 5-day discovery hearing discussing whether or not Microsoft's acquisition of mobile games developer Activision-Blizzard is anti-consumer.  Some relevant facts provides a clearer picture:  The deal is valued at 69 billion dollars enterprise value, with a buyout price of 95 dollars a share.  The deal is a classic example of a vertical acquisition from micro-economics.  Microsoft originally anticipated to close the deal on May 22 2023, until UK regulatory authorities moved to block the deal.  China and the European Union have already approved the business combination, despite the US and the UK opposed to the deal on Sony's behalf.  Sony's reason to oppose the deal is that such an acquisition would prevent the company from charging its 70 dollars per month PlayStation Plus subscription to Call of Duty Users. Sony however maintains that the real reason to oppose the deal is that Microsoft could block Call of Duty from being available on PlayStation 5.  The deadline to close the deal has been moved to July 18 2023.  During the 5-day discovery hearing, both sides produced highly confidential documents in court and made very convincing arguments for their views.  The most convincing piece of evidence was an internal email with Sony CEO indicating that the acquisition will be much bigger than just excluding the PlayStation platform from Call of Duty.  The email weakens Sony's claim that Microsoft will exclude Call of Duty from PlayStation, but strengthens the FTC's anti-trust argument that the acquisition will disrupt competition.  On Tuesday, the Department of Justice's antitrust department and the Federal Trade Commission jointly developed plans to streamline the review process for all mergers and acquisitions, giving the judge an incentive to grant them a preliminary junction on this case.  CNBC's Scott Wapner speculates that Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley won't make a ruling on the evidentiary hearing until after the July 4th holiday. However, Judge Corley's calendar clearly has events everyday after July 4th.  Judge Corley will likely make a decision on whether to grant the FTC a preliminary junction before Friday, and both Microsoft and Activision will make a decision on whether they are interested in closing the deal around the same time.  There is a real possibility that the deal may sink by the end of the week despite the fact that Microsoft has repeatedly assured people that Call of Duty will remain on PlayStation 5, creating an opportunity for people to short the stock before the 5-day proceedings conclude.

"Why Microsoft's gross margins are expanding (up 1.89% QoQ).";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18p3r0i/why_microsofts_gross_margins_are_expanding_up_189/";" At this stage, Microsoft is essentially an AI copilot factory, as Satya explained in the conference call:  ""We're using this AI inflection point to redefine our role in business applications. We are becoming the Copilot-led business process transformation layer on top of existing CRM systems like Salesforce.""  It is a unified server that dishes out business applications to billions of people worldwide. As folks use these apps, they generate data, which can then be used to train AIs that automate work.  What' was interesting is we saw margins expand this quarter (Q1 FY2024).  Microsoft’s gross margin came in at 71.16% in Q1 FY2024, up from 69.84% last quarter–a high since 2014.  In turn, operating margin came in at 47.59%, up from 41.08% last quarter \[1\].  It turns out this was mostly due to a novel architecture that Microsoft has deployed, to obtain maximum leverage per AI model.  According to management, increases in gross margin are due primarily to ‘improvements’ in the cloud and Office 365 businesses. Satya clarifies these improvements during the Q&A:  ""But the thing is, we have scale leverage of one large model that was trained and one large model that's being used for inference across all our first-party SaaS apps, as well as our API in our Azure AI service…  The lesson learned from the cloud side is–we're not running a conglomerate of different businesses, it's all one tech stack up and down Microsoft's portfolio, and that, I think, is going to be very important because that discipline, given what it will look like for this AI transition, any business that's not disciplined about their capital spend accruing across all their businesses could run into trouble.""  Over time, this architecture will enable Microsoft to maximize the number of users engaged with copilots daily, while minimizing computing expenses. This should ultimately equate to a higher earning power.  I wonder whether other cloud players are doing the same?";"12";"2023-12-23T12:27:42"

The initiative includes the development of an artificial intelligence supercomputer named ""Stargate."" While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI. The focus of the current phase is on procuring AI chips necessary for the subsequent phases.

"Poor Man’s Covered Call What it is, why I’m doing it with $30k worth of MSFT calls , and why you should consider trying it. TLDR at TOP";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/19c376l/poor_mans_covered_call_what_it_is_why_im_doing_it/";"TLDR: selling covered calls good. You can use long-term call options as collateral instead of having to buy 100 shares of the underlying asset. This makes you big money at a relatively lower risk than you might expect. it’s a strategy that consists of buying ITM or very close to ITM, long-term call options and then using that as collateral to sell a short term OTM covered call.  I made this post in response to a lot of the people on my last WSB post. Turns out not many people seem to know what the PMCC is despite this being a heavily option based sub Reddit (so I will try to simplify it for those that don’t know much about options).  A call option gives you the option to purchase an equity at the strike price. Where as a person who owns 100 shares can sell a covered call option and they will sell you those 100 shares for your strike price. The premium you pay is what he gets to keep. So his goal is to write options that will never be able to be exercised, that way, he keeps both the premium and his 100 shares. He does this by selling short term very OTM call options. They’re great because there are fools that think that buying multiple cheap call options will make them more money than one really expensive in the money long-term option. And this is where WSB comes in. There are plenty of people in the sub that simply love FDs for whatever reason (I genuinely believe that some people don’t fully understand why people love to sell these to them).  So let me explain why one is smart and why one is dumb.  Let’s say Microsoft is currently $400 , I bought 100 shares for that price and I’m going to sell a covered call that expires in one month at a strike price of 425.   let’s say that Microsoft hit the price of $430 and the person exercised the option. In this scenario I would have to sell my 100 shares of Microsoft for $425 despite selling for $430 on the market. But hey, remember you bought them for $400. Now you sold them for $425 and you get to keep whatever the person paid for the premium on top of that. The risk here is that Microsoft could hit something like $470 and you would still have to sell it for $425 and the premium you made is nowhere near enough to compensate the money you could’ve gotten if you would’ve just held onto it and not sold. You as the call option writer Can decide to sell a very short term very out the money call option that will likely never be exercised but it will be sold for cheap or you could sell a very close to the money longer-term call option for a massive premium. (or of course, something in between.) but with that being said 80% of all call options written expire worthless so you do have a bit of a competitive edge on your side.  Now, as for the buyer He buys a bunch of short term out the money call options for cheap because he thinks he will make more money this way (which is of course possible, but it would be very very unlikely) Unfortunately, Theta really kicks in the last 1-2 months so because he chose a short term option he really really needs to fight against the clock here. Also, because the call options he bought are really OTM, the Delta on his options are very low, meaning he would need a massive price movement in order to feel anything through his options. Obviously he is set up for failure and his call options expire worthless which happens 90% of the time and even when it doesn’t it doesn’t necessarily make up for all the money lost in the past.  So what have we learned?  Selling covered calls good, buying short term out the money options bad.  But do you have $40,000 to buy 100 shares of Microsoft so that you can write call options on it ? Or let’s assume that you do, you could buy 100 shares or you can buy multiple long-term call options that are ITM or close to it. And remember each call option represents 100 shares of Microsoft. And because let’s say you bought three, you can then sell three short term out the money covered call options. If you get assigned you now have to sell 100 shares to the person at whatever the strike is. You don’t need to actually own 100 shares You just need to have enough money to buy 100 shares and then you will sell them at the strike price. But wait, the stock price must have gone up in Order for the options to able to be exercised, but wait you own call options! See where this is going. Most up-to-date brokerages let you use call options as collateral to sell covered calls because of this very reason. In the scenario where you get assigned, you should hopefully have call options that increased in value. Now you can sell a call option for more than what you bought it for and on top of that you keep the premium . However, this introduces more risk because depending on your contract length and how near the money your call options that you bought and sold are it is completely possible to have to pay a lot for the assignment and not have options that went up all that much (and they can always expire worthless If you do decide to keep holding them) Also, if you think the covered call, you sold will be dramatically ITM by its expiration date at some point, you could just pay to close the position you’ll pay whatever premium it’s going for, but then you won’t be using it as collateral any longer much better than being assigned. But there are ways to minimize this. Simply put, sell short term out the money options so that whoever buys them has to deal with high Theta and low Delta, meaning time decay will dramatically, eat up the intrinsic value of the contract, and there would have to be massive price movement to have a positive effect on the option price they bought. Meanwhile you buy long-term in the money call options as collateral. Meaning that theta will not eat up much of its intrinsic value, and because your delta is very high since it’s in the money small movements in the underlying assets will have a bigger impact on your option, whether for better or for worse. Oh, and now you’re able to sell many more call options because instead of buying 100 shares you bought contracts that represent 100 shares.  Of course, like anything it works until it doesn’t . But even if the underlying asset you write it on end up tanking you at least keep the premium. Depending on how long the contract is you could hold if you think it might eventually go back up or sell it for significantly less than what you bought it for but at the very least, it keeps a lot of its intrinsic value since it’s a long-term contract.  So far everything I’ve covered is the PMCC strategy as you would read or hear about it, the following is my take and twist on it  I am exclusively doing this with Microsoft simply because it’s Microsoft . As in it’s a very reputable company and it only seems to go up.  If I have five call options, I do not write five covered calls on it because I don’t ever want to have to risk liquidating my entire options portfolio  (even if you make sure the risk is relatively low. The risk is still there)  Speaking of, I buy the bulk of my options to be expiring one year or more from when I bought it so that it can qualify for long-term capital gains tax (remember it’s not just about how much money you make, It’s also about how much money you get to keep.)  And what do I do with the options premiums I collect ? Well I simply save until I get enough to buy another long-term in the money call option, which lets me sell more cover, call options, which can then help me buy more call options, which can then help me sell more covered call options (you get the idea.) and lowers the cost basis of the call options I buy if I decide to continue injecting my own cash from my bank account. Also it gives me a bit of downside protection since I’ll be able to keep the premium if things turn for the worst whereas normally, if the option you buy doesn’t end up working out you just lose everything. And remember your long-term in the money call options will retain a good amount of their intrinsic value at least.  Of course, the whole idea is that the underlying asset will go up and at least move closer to your strike price overtime. This is like buying a regular leap but with extra steps because along the way, you have potential to make considerable income because of the premiums you collect.  If done correctly, and all goes well, you can exponentially grow your portfolio value really quickly with a lower risk than you would expect  Anyway, this was a bit of a oversimplification. I highly recommend you watch a YouTube video if you are interested. Yes I am aware of the other Greeks but I didn’t want to bring them up because this post is already long and complicated as it is.

The man became a house-hold name when he pulled a reverse-Julius Caesar, outmaneuvered his board, and with Satya Nadella's wizardry, resurrected from the corporate underworld to vanquish his betrayers.

Six months of hush-hush and suspense since the stock's been in limbo, waiting for the merger. But here's the kicker: I've got a hunch Microsoft's gonna cozy up with ALCC on Investor Day. Why? Because Satya is gay for Sam and Microsoft has got a hard on for nuclear.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/muavrpycbefc1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c42bb8df09b7578bbb6fa870524e2fdd9d0d4528  Here’s Microsoft signing a deal with a private nuclear company, Helion. Guess who’s the chairman of Helion and invested $500M in it? Sam fucking Altman. He made the deal happen with Helion, and he’ll likely make one happen with Oklo.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/4wvy326gbefc1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9511ff691a20ae2c59079bc806b7faf602309f73  But its a SPAC right?

"Why I'm getting AMZN calls for today's earnings";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cgwhxy/why_im_getting_amzn_calls_for_todays_earnings/";"Amazon (AMZN) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q1 2024 results **today.** I expect amazon to do well today on both earnings and revenues, and I'll explain why here. The company outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 14% to $170 billion. It was driven by a 13% rise in the North America and Amazon web services segments, followed by a 17% gain in the International division. We expect the first quarter result to follow the same trend. I also am anticipating Amazon will release a dividend like META and GOOG, which I'll go into a lot of detail later.   Let's talk about AMZN's ride over the past few years—it's been a bit of a roller coaster, especially when you stack it up against the S&P 500. Back in early 2021, AMZN was hovering around $165. Fast forward to now, and it's ticked up to about $180. Sounds decent, right? But hold up, because that's nothing compared to the S&P, which has shot up by roughly 35% in the same period.  Looking at the yearly breakdown: AMZN only inched up by 2% in 2021, then took a massive 50% dive in 2022, but bounced back hard with an 81% surge in 2023. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 had its own drama but less extreme, posting a 27% gain in 2021, dropping 19% in 2022, and climbing back up by 24% in 2023.  The takeaway? While AMZN did outperform the S&P in 2023, it lagged behind in the previous years. And this isn't just an AMZN thing—other big names in the Consumer Discretionary sector like TSLA, TM, and HD, and even tech giants like GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL have also found it tough to consistently beat the S&P, in both up and down markets. So, what's next for AMZN? Let's keep our eyes peeled for their upcoming earnings report.  # Revenue Beat  Amazon’s revenues grew 12% y-o-y to $574.8 billion in FY2023. All major categories posted growth in the year – online stores (5%), physical stores (6%), third-party seller services (19%), subscription services (14%), advertising services (24%), and AWS (13%). We expect the same trend to continue in Q1. Overall, we forecast Amazon’s revenues to touch $641.4 billion for the full-year 2024.  # EPS Beat   Amazon Q1 2024 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.85 per Trefis analysis, 2% above the consensus estimate of $0.83. The adjusted net income increased from -$2.7 billion to $30.4 billion in FY 2023. It was primarily because of lower operating expenses as a % of revenues, higher revenues, and a significant jump in the total non-operating income from -$18.2 billion to $705 million. Notably, the non-operating income was down in 2022 due to a marketable equity securities valuation loss. Further, the same trend was witnessed in Q4 2023. We expect the Q1 results to be on similar lines. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $4.12 and revenue per share of $61.48 for the full-year 2024.  # Possible Dividend Announcement  Meta threw out its first dividend this March, and Google's parent company Alphabet isn't far behind, announcing a 20 cent dividend set for mid-June. This leaves us wondering about Amazon—when are they joining the dividend party?  By the numbers, it seems like it’s about time Amazon starts giving back some quarterly cash to its shareholders. Over the last decade, Amazon has racked up a cool $90 billion in free cash flow. Out of that giant pot, it only used about $6 billion for share buybacks in 2022, which is roughly a 7% capital return.  In comparison, other trillion-dollar behemoths have been way more generous, returning about 75% of their free cash flow over the past year—though most of that was through share repurchases rather than dividends. Together, these non-Amazon trillion-dollar companies generated around $323 billion in cash flow over the last year, paid out $38 billion in dividends, and snapped up about $240 billion in their own stock.  For Amazon, cash flow isn't the issue. Wall Street's looking at a projected free cash flow of about $62 billion for 2024, which is expected to jump to $82 billion by 2025, per Bloomberg. So, the big question remains: when will Amazon start sending some of that cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends? Let's stay tuned and see if they'll open up their wallet.  But what would this look like? If Amazon decided to payout 75% of its projected 2024 free cash flow, we're talking about a dividend yield of around 2.4%. That actually beats the average 2.2% yield from other dividend-paying companies in the S&P.  This 2.4% isn't just dividends—it includes any buybacks Amazon might throw into the mix. To give you a benchmark, the total shareholder yield for S&P 500 dividend payers has been about 3.3% over the past year. With Amazon’s hefty cash flow, it’s looking more and more like they’re due to start sharing the wealth.  Just for context, consider a bit of history. Microsoft went public back in 1986, and it took them 17 years and a revenue climb from less than $200 million to $32 billion before they started paying dividends in 2003. Since then, Microsoft’s sales have been growing at a steady 10% yearly, with around $28 in dividends per share dished out to date. Fast forward to 2024, Microsoft’s expected to hit sales around $260 billion.  Amazon, on the other hand, went public in 1997 and has exploded from $600 million to nearly $600 billion in annual sales. With projections showing a growth rate of about 12% over the next few years, Amazon is well-positioned to both fuel further growth and start paying dividends.  Currently, Microsoft’s stock yields about 0.8%. If Amazon wanted to match this, they’d need to allocate roughly 20% of their forecasted free cash flow for the next two years to dividends—totally doable since S&P 500 dividend payers typically spend about half their free cash flow on dividends.  Bottom line: Amazon doesn’t need to aim for a 0.8% yield right off the bat. Kicking things off with literally any dividend would be a solid move. And if they do so, the stock will PUMP. This is why I'm getting calls for earnings. A call spread would be good, for those who can't get a call spread, AMZN 5/3 190c @ 3.20 doesn't look too bad. I'm picking 190c because the stock has *on average* moved about 7% up or down with earnings. A 7% push up today would bring the stock to about 192ish. Not enough for the calls to profit, so getting a call spread is deal. To do this, I'll just sell the 200c @ 1.19. So the cost of the whole position becomes 2.01/share. Not too bad. Good luck guys.";"270";"2024-04-30T18:03:31"

If Trump wins election and FTC changes leadership, Nvidia will likely try to acquire ARM outright.   Background: In late September 2020, [Nvidia announced plans to acquire ARM from Softbank](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-for-40-billion-creating-worlds-premier-computing-company-for-the-age-of-ai) for $40 billion. At that time, NVDA was \~ $400 billion company, 10x the value of ARM. In December 2021, the [FTC sues to block the merger](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-sues-block-40-billion-semiconductor-chip-merger) citing anti-competitive advantages the combined firm would do in the AI race. On February 2022, Nvidia and Softbank announce [the termination of Nvidia acquitition of ARM Holdings](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-softbank-group-announce-termination-of-nvidias-acquisition-of-arm-limited) and Softbank immediately announced plans to IPO ARM. ARM would IPO in September of 2023.   All the major tech companies in the world (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom, AMD, META, Tesla, and many many others) are working to design their own chips, most are based on [ARM architecture](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/11/09/how-arm-gained-chip-dominance-with-apple-nvidia-amazon-and-qualcomm.html) and Jensen Huang sees the writing on the wall. Jensen also knows that his main competitors, including some of the big boys, are also champing at the bit to either get their own stake or prevent Nvidia from cornering the entire market outright. It's a race against the inevitable.   If Nvidia was successful in acquiring ARM back in 2021, those $40 billion NVDA shares would be worth $220 billion to Softbank today if we go by the 10x valuation metric that both Nvidia and Softbank likely agreed upon back in 2020.   TL:DR: Missed NVDA run, buy ARM shares or leaps. Not investment advice!  &#x200B:";"1192";"2024-03-06T17:37:49"

I went in for a small stack of $7 calls for 3/15 only to awake and find that they were up 140%, I decided to research more and decided to go in for fifty more $9 calls for 3/15 which are also green.

Pay attention to the reasons below:  1) The AGI (artificial general intelligence) is a  crock of shit.  A simple algorithm that jumbles words that is meaningless. I tried ChatGPT and it directed me to useless sites asking for pay for their useless services. A Microsoft con job.  2) The P/E of 36 is way too high for a traditional business software company.  I thing 20 is more reasonable.  3) This thing with Mr. Altman is ridiculous: a effective altruist who will change the world by donating money for the better good of humanity thru a shell game like SBF.    4) Another con job: MSFT will take over Open AI because they’ll offer high paying jobs that talented Programmers can’t  resist.  BS!!    5) Once the uselessness of a fake AI enterprise is exposed - it’ll crash like the dot.com bubble from years past.    There are many better companies to invest in.  Companies that will provide profits thru useful enterprises.   How many times do you use Google, Amazon, and Apple?   MSFT chose the low road. SELL!!!";"0";"2023-11-26T04:43:20"
"(MSFT) How to profit from my r/singularity delusions this week?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bho3e2/msft_how_to_profit_from_my_rsingularity_delusions/";"Hi revvered WSB.  I'm visiting here from deep in the trenches of r/singularity, a community almost equally deranged as yours. We have strong reasons to believe that a new release of GPT will happen tomorrow (march 19th) and that Microsoft will be integrating this into their copilot offering (march 21:st).  >Ok now we have multiple things pointing to a March 19 release:  >1. Same conditions as March 14th GPT-4 Tuesday release last year: Microsoft event on Thursday, upcoming Lex Fridman interview with Sam  >2. Microsoft Copilot offering GPT-4 Turbo for free, so there’s very little incentive for ChatGPT Plus.  >3. Discontinuation of plugins on ChatGPT on March 19  >The Microsoft event is titled “Advancing the new era of work with Copilot”. What would they be advancing if they just showed us the same old Copilot we’ve had this entire time? Of course, I could be wrong  Given the developments in the space, and cryptic tweets from OpenAI employees this release *will in the community beliefs* surpass market expectations. There are several other good reasons for this from a game theory perspective as well. This should be especially huge for MSFT as it seems like OpenAI have pivoted heavily towards agentic development, providing beautiful synergy effects for MSFT utilization of gpt in copilot with their office suite offering. They are singlehandedly sitting in this unique position in the AI hype market rn.  I believe this 100%, I believe we will see positive returns on MSFT this week.  **My question to you degens:** Given that I believe this, how can I best profit from this prediction with limited capital? Are bull certificates with multipliers the way to go or is another financial instrument better used?  Thank you dear wizards of stock markets.";"14";"2024-03-18T12:07:30"
"Has Alphabet Lost Its Edge?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18gwlrv/has_alphabet_lost_its_edge/";"TL:DR: Until we can try out Gemini Ultra, it's at least questionable to what extent Alphabet's new AI is really superior to GPT 4. Microsoft also provides an ecosystem into which OpenAI's GPTs fit seamlessly. Where does that leave Alphabet if Gemini Ultra doesn't deliver on all its promises? - Google Search, and here again, Microsoft's Bing is catching up, using the power of OpenAI.  This is not financial advice.  The full text can be found [here](https://medium.com/@chaotropy/g%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung-has-alphabet-lost-its-edge-b3d78efe3a9c) or [here](https://www.chaotropy.com/gotterdammerung-has-alphabet-lost-its-edge/).  ""\[...\]Last week Alphabet announced its new AI Gemini, which will be released in 3 different versions: Nano, Pro and Ultra. According to Google Deepmind’s recent report, Gemini Ultra outperforms OpenAI’s GPT 4 in almost all benchmarks. This claim was supported by a video that turned out to be staged (I wouldn’t call it a fake, as the [real prompts were also published](https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/12/how-its-made-gemini-multimodal-prompting.html)). But if Gemini Ultra is finally superior to GPT 4 and this can be proven by many benchmarks, why does Alphabet continue to hide its prodigy? Why does Alphabet take the risk that OpenAI will release GPT 4.5 in the near future and thus sweep away all the doubts about its superiority?  Hasn’t Alphabet’s innovation lead always been a big part of the investment thesis for Alphabet shareholders? Now Alphabet is trying hard to show that its secret AI, Gemini Ultra, can keep up with the already publicly available GPT 4 — marketing aside, the published report on Gemini Ultra doesn’t say much more than that. An AI is not a gasoline engine. You cannot simply quantify its performance on a scale and then claim that a single-digit percentage difference is evidence of one’s superiority over the other. I am not an expert in quantitative evaluation of AI, but ultimately AI is statistical learning, and in my experience the new generative language models do not always produce reproducible results (especially when generating images). Accordingly, shouldn’t the significance level of the measured performance differences be specified? Couldn’t these rather small differences just be statistical noise in favor of Gemini? Also, the results given are not reproducible because we cannot test Gemini Ultra. And again, if Gemini Ultra is so superior, why can’t we just try it? So has Alphabet lost its edge? I don’t know, but with every statement without a tangible product, my doubts about the company’s superiority grow.  And let’s not forget the giant behind [OpenAI with a 49% stake: Microsoft](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/30/microsoft-join-openai-board-altman), which has a product ecosystem that literally screams for AI implementations. And I’m not just talking about Word, which will soon be writing for us, PowerPoint, which will magically put together our next presentation, or Excel, which will soon be giving no one a headache: Microsoft Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are widely used integrated development environments (IDEs) and industry standards. Microsoft’s code-generating bot, Github Copilot, has been available as a plug-in since 2021. So if AI is going to have a real impact on business productivity and therefore our economies, it could be through the infrastructure that Microsoft provides. So even if Gemini Ultra beats GPT4 in many ways and OpenAI cannot deliver a better AI in the near future, Microsoft is providing the services where AI could become a real productivity driver.  And what will Alphabet have left if it loses this AI battle? People use its cash cow, Google Search, today largely because they’ve been used to it for two decades — that’s worth a lot, but maybe Bing can slay even that metaphorical dragon with the magic of OpenAI, unaware of its often-called unbeatable dominance\[...\]""";"0";"2023-12-12T22:15:16"

"QCOM Thesis";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1aippe6/qcom_thesis/";"I have been watching the AI hardware game play out, and I my theory is that Qualcomm is ridiculously under valued vs other AI hardware providers.   Qualcomm's latest offerings on device are powerful enough to do some really interesting things on device as we can see with the S24 ultra. All of a sudden phones can begin to do more locally vs just being a portal into the internet.   I think more interestingly, Qualcomm is in theory about to come into desktop computing in a big way with the x elite desktop chip. I get it if people think Qualcomm has no room for growth on phones because they are already top dog, but they could potentially completely destroy intel and amd in the laptop and potentially desktop market. Apples m chips are ridiculously better then anything intel or apple can throw at laptops without paying insane gamer money, and the x elite will prolly be the same, which btw Microsoft is betting on with windows 12. Imagine if Microsoft starts to depend on x elite for copilot???  Next up you have their ai 100 inference cards, which seem to be ridiculously good at doing cost effective inference. From what I can tell, they have all been snapped up by large cloud providers and they most likely didn't produce enough, and hopefully they are ramping up production.   So, these guys dominate phones with the best stuff, Microsoft is making windows 12 compatible with arm architecture for the first time ever and they have the first and only option (and it looks like it will be hands down better in both general computing and ai workloads then what's on the market). And to top it off they have a credible line of ai inference server cards that are selling like hotcakes.  What on earth is going on with their stock price? You have to really think people think xelite and server inference hardware will be literally worthless to have the current valuation. These guys are coming for nvidia, intel,  and amds pie and they have a really credible shot at taking a huge slice of their traditional market and the new ai stuff. X elite alone is enough to bankrupt intel.";"26";"2024-02-04T15:58:30"

AI is the internet plus the ability to reason and analyze anything you give it in fractions of a second. A new unequivocal boomstick to whomever wants to use it.  The true winners will be those startups in fields such as robotics, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, space-aeronautics, aviation, protein synthesis, new materials and so, so much more who will use AI in new and exciting ways.  Boston dynamics, set to boom. Self-driving robotaxis, set to boom. Flying taxis, set to boom. Job replacement/automation for legacy industry jobs white collar, set to boom. Personal AI agents for your individual workloads, booming. Healthcare change as we know it (doctors won't like this but too bad), set to boom.  The amount of industry that is set to shift and mutate and emerge from AI in the next 3 - 5 years will be astonishing.  I can tell you, standing on principal, that OpenAI's next release will be so game changing that nobody will deny where AI is heading. There is not a rock you can hide under to be so oblivious as to not see where this is going.  The reason why I bring up the next iteration of ChatGPT, GPT5, is because they are initiators of this phenomenon. Other, such as Google (and others) are furiously trying to catch up but as of today the 'MOAT' may be upon us.  The reason to believe that one may catch up (or try like hell to) is from the amount of compute power from GPU's it takes to train an ungodly amount of data. Trillions of data points. Billions (soon to be Trillions) of parameters all simulating that of the synaptic neuron connections in which the human brain functions that in turn gives us the spark of life and consciousness. Make no mistake, these guys are living out a present day Manhattan project.  These people are trying to build consciousness agency with the all the world's information as a reference document at it's finger tips. Today.  And guess what. The only way these guys can build that thing - That AGI/ASI/GAI reality - Is through Nvidia.  These guys believe and have tested that if you throw MORE compute at the problem it actually GAINS function. More compute equals more consciousness. That's what these people believe and they're attempting it.  Here, let me show you what I mean. What the graph below shows is that over time the amount of data and parameters that are being used to train an AI model. I implore you to watch this video as it is a great easy to understand educational video into what the hell is going on with all of this AI stuff. It's a little technical but very informative and there are varying opinions. I pulled out the very best part in relation to Nvidia here. [AI: Grappling with a New Kind of Intelligence](https://youtu.be/EGDG3hgPNp8?si=L71CUbmqho3jhKEh&t=3768)  https://preview.redd.it/vk5twc041hic1.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3d2bdf42cf25e1c04e940b2f61d0219871f2334  It's SO RIDICULOUS that you wouldn't be able to continue to see the beginning so they have to use a log plot chart. And as you see we are heading into Trillions of parameters. For reference GPT-4 was trained on roughly 200 billion parameters.  https://preview.redd.it/6cq17n5i1hic1.png?width=1327&format=png&auto=webp&s=830334aa7cdaddfa10d7f6512d10025f136076ed  It is estimated GPT-5 will be trained with 2-5 trillion parameters.  Sam Altman was dead ass serious when he is inquiring about obtaining $7 trillion for chip development. They believe that with enough compute they can create GOD.  So what's the response from Google, Meta and others. Well, they're forming ""AI """"Alliances"""""". Along with that they are going to and buying from the largest AI arms dealer on earth: Nvidia.  Nvidia is a common day AI Industrial Complex War machine.  **Sovereign AI with AI Foundries**  It's not just companies that are looking to compete it's also entire Nation States. Remember, when Italy banned GPT. Well, it turns out, countries don't want the United States building and implementing their AI into other country's culture and way of life.  So as of today, you have a battle of not just corporate America but entire countries looking to buy the bullets, tanks and missiles needed for this AI fight. Nvidia sells the absolute best bullets, the best guns, the best ammo one needs to attempt to create their own AI epicenters.  And it's so important that it is a national security risk to not just us the United States but to be a nation and not have the capability of AI.  Remember the leak about Q\* and a certain encryption being undone. You don't think heads of State where listening to that. Whether it was true or not it is now an imperative that you get with AI or get left behind. That goes just as much for a nation as it does for you as an individual.  When asked about the risk of losing out sales to China on Nvidia's last earnings call Jensen Huang clearly stated he was not worried about it because literally nations are coming online to build AI foundries.  **Nvidia's Numbers and The Power Of Compounding**  The power of compounding and why I think there share price is where it is today and has so much more room to grow. Let me ask you a question but first let me say that AWS's annual revenues are at \~$80/Y Billion. How long do you think with Nvidia's revenues of \~$18/Q Billion to reach or eclipse AWS at a 250% growth rate?  15 years? 10 Years? 5 years? Answer: 1.19 years. Ok let's not be ridiculous perhaps it's 200% instead.  5 years? Nope. 1.35 years.  Let's say they have a bad quarter and Italy doesn't pay up. 150%  5 years right? Nope. 1.62 years.  Come on they can't keep this up. 100%.  has to be 5 years this time. Nope. 2.15 years.  100% growth/2.15 years to 250% growth/1.19 years to reach 80 billion in annual revenues.  They're growth last year was 281%.  So wait, I wasn't being fair. I used $80 billion for AWS while their revenues last year where $88 Billion and Nvidia's last years 4 quarters where \~$33 Billion.  Here are those growth numbers it would take Nvidia to reach $88 billion.  At 279% =  0.73 years  At 250% = 0.78 years  At 200% = 0.89 years  at 100% = 1.41 years  Folks. That's JUST the data center. They are poised to surpass AWS, Azure and Google Cloud in about .73 to 1.5 years. Yes, you heard that right, your daddy's cloud company is about to be overtaken by your son's gaming GPU company.  When people say Nvidia is undervalued. This is what they are talking about. This is a P/S story not a P/E story.

The board effectively had no control since the beginning and were essentially kept in the dark on many projects such as Sam setting up external AI infrastructure businesses to feed into the system when they decided to exit.  He used OpenAI as a training/weed out program on their dime to build a rockstar team with the promise of significant equity stakes in the new venture.   This was planned years earlier with Microsoft so they could prep for the transition and ramp up quickly with minimal downtown.  The board fucking clueless the entire time thought they were in complete control and that Sam was checked out and losing confidence with his team which was all coming from a small team of board supporting degenerates who weren’t going to make the cut anyway.

Line 2 is the slope which shows the rate that it falls from the top. Copy this slope and apply it to today for line 3. The point where it intersects line 1 is when it stops going down. Draw horizontal line 4 from here and you can see the price is close to 320. Draw vertical line 5 and note that time is close to end of 2023.  The reason it goes down is because all the AI and quantum computers and everything that you can think of is already priced in.

So, Nvidia sold a lot of chips, OpenAI and Microsoft sold a lot of subscriptions, and that's pretty much it.       There aren't many other companies actually making money from AI, since there aren't real use cases where it's actually useful in a B2B case.

"Ultimate Nvidia DD (The Best)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1asejqq/ultimate_nvidia_dd_the_best/";"First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens.      It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark.   No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space.  First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently?  You could say it’s because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood.   It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT.  AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks.  How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype?   Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it’s not just any Product. It’s a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.   An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand.  This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).  This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW.  They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party.  How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else.  Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts:  \- Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees  \- Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to)  \- Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development)  \- Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers  The Analogy:  „Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood).  TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees.  The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.  At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture.  Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.  Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market.  What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process.  Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“        \----  NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips.  Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that’s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn’t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture.  NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them.  Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC.   TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple.  So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them.  There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.  So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel.   Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD?   This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design.  Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough.  AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips.  Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again.  According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.  Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?!  Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so:  „However, in 2010, **Apple** made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration.  Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple’s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.“ ([Does Apple use Nvidia?

"Nvidia chases $30 billion custom chip market with new unit";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1amo3hn/nvidia_chases_30_billion_custom_chip_market_with/";"Nvidia NVDA  is building a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for  cloud computing firms and others, including advanced artificial  intelligence processors, according to nine sources familiar with the  company's plans.  The dominant global designer and  supplier of AI chips aims to capture a portion of an exploding market  for custom AI chips and to protect itself from the growing number of  companies interested in finding alternatives to its products.  The  Santa Clara, California-based company currently controls about 80% of  the market for high-end AI chips, a position that has sent its market  value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than  tripled in 2023.  Its customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOG and Meta Platforms META, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of Nvidia chips to compete in the rapidly emerging generative AI sector.  Nvidia's  H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor  for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started  to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. Doing so helps  reduce energy consumption, and potentially can shrink the cost and time  to design.  Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in  helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to  rival firms such as Broadcom AVGO and Marvell Technology MRVL, according to the sources who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  ""If  you're really trying to optimize on things like power, or optimize on  cost for your application, you can't afford to go drop an H100 or A100  in there,"" Greg Reichow, general partner at venture capital firm Eclipse  Ventures said in an interview. ""You want to have the exact right  mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need.""  Nvidia does not disclose H100 prices, which are higher than for the  prior-generation A100, but each chip can sell from $16,000 to $100,000  depending on the volume purchased and other factors. Meta has said it  plans to bring its total stock to 350,000 H100s this year.  Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon .com AMZN,  Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for  them, according to two sources familiar with the meetings. Beyond data  center chips, the company has pursued telecom, automotive and video game  customers.  In 2022, Nvidia said it would let  third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking  technology with their own chips. The company has said nothing about the  program since, and Reuters is reporting its wider ambitions for the  first time.  A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company's 2022 announcement.  Dina McKinney, a former Advanced Micro Devices AMD  and Marvell executive, heads Nvidia's custom unit and her team's goal  is to make its technology available for customers in cloud, 5G wireless,  video games and automotives, according to a LinkedIn profile. Those  mentions were scrubbed and her title was changed after Reuters sought  comment from Nvidia.  Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment.  $30 BILLION MARKET  According  to estimates from research firm 650 Group’s Alan Weckel, the data  center custom chip market will grow to as much as $10 billion this year,  and double that in 2025.  The broader custom chip market  was worth roughly $30 billion in 2023, which amounts to roughly 5% of  annual global chip sales, according to Needham analyst Charles Shi.  Currently, custom silicon design for data centers is dominated by Broadcom and Marvell.  In  a typical arrangement, a design partner such as Nvidia would offer  intellectual property and technology, but leave the chip fabrication,  packaging and additional steps to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  2330 or another contract chip manufacturer.  Nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into Broadcom and Marvell sales.  ""With  Broadcom's custom silicon business touching $10 billion, and Marvell’s  around $2 billion, this is a real threat,"" said Dylan Patel, founder of  the silicon research group SemiAnalysis. ""It's a real big negative -  there's more competition entering the fray.""  BEYOND AI  Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson 61QS  for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics  processing unit (GPU) technology, according to two sources familiar with  the talks.  650 Group's Weckle expects the telecom custom chip market to remain flat at roughly $4 billion to $5 billion a year.  Ericsson declined to comment.  Nvidia also plans to target the automotive and video game markets, according to sources and public social media postings.  Weckel  expects the custom auto market to grow consistently from its current $6  billion to $8 billion range at 20% a year, and the $7 billion to $8  billion video game custom chip market could increase with the  next-generation consoles from Xbox and Sony 6857.  Nintendo’s  current Switch handheld console already includes an Nvidia chip, the  Tegra X1. A new version of the Switch console expected this year is  likely to include a Nvidia custom design, according to one source.  Nintendo declined to comment.  &#x200B:  \- Reuters";"332";"2024-02-09T14:25:56"

Apple has been slower in rolling out generative AI, which can generate human-like responses to written prompts, than rivals Microsoft and Google, which are weaving them into products.Last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook [said](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-shareholders-reject-ai-disclosure-proposal-2024-02-28/) the company plans to disclose later this year more about its plans to put generative AI to use, adding that the company is investing ""significantly"" in the area.";"50";"2024-03-18T07:39:43"

"Amazon Earnings: The Boomer Play that Could Print 🚀💰";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17h0sy7/amazon_earnings_the_boomer_play_that_could_print/";"Alright, buckle up degenerates, here comes Amazon's earnings rollercoaster. Is this the meme stock of the month? Nah, but it could be the boomer play that prints. Let's break it down. 🚀 Amazon is set to report earnings today, the company's had massive earnings growth this year, beating EPS estimates by 44% and 89% in the last two quarters, respectively. Today, the quarterly earnings are expected to come in at an EPS of $0.60 on $141.5 billion in revenue. $127.1 billion the previous year.  Jeff Bezos might've shot himself into space, but his money-making behemoth stays grounded on Earth. The company is doing well with amazon shares are up 42% this year, topping the Nasdaq’s 23% gain. So, the big question: YOLO some calls for earnings or nah? After Amazon’s growth slowed dramatically last year due to rising inflation and economic concerns, expansion has ticked up a bit in 2022, though it’s still weaker than usual for the company. Amazon’s retail business is expected to show some improvement from consumers tepidly resuming discretionary spending.   Analysts are expecting growth of 11% in the third quarter, marking a slight acceleration from the past couple quarters. E-commerce sales boomed during the pandemic, then slowed as shoppers returned to physical stores. I'll be focused on the results of Amazon's Prime Big Deals Days event, as well as guidance for consumer spending during the holidays.  **Cloud Computing**  Being the world's largest cloud provider and a significant profit driver for amazon (nearly 70%), all eyes will be on Amazon Web Services (AWS).   Amazon’s cloud computing business is a concern for a lot of people in wall street, as growth in AWS has been slowing in recent quarters. Google just reported earnings and one of its misses was in the cloud revenue department—could this mean that AWS is taking more of the lion's share. However, you'd think the frenzy around generative artificial intelligence is leading to bigger workloads in the cloud, which should be a boon for AWS and its rival public cloud vendors. Looking at Microsoft (MSFT), sales in their Azure cloud unit grew 29%, faster than the 26% expected by analysts. This is considered bitter sweet as this could be eating into AWS' market share.   I expect stable AWS revenue, but want to know more about higher energy costs and rising competition. They currently hold a 40% share of the cloud services market last year, compared to Microsoft's 21.5% and Google's 7.5%.  **Ads**  Let's talk ads. Amazon's ad sales are right up there with Alphabet (GOOG) and Meta (META), so it will be interesting to see how it fared this quarter. One of Amazon's fastest-growing business sectors. Alphabet beat ad-sales estimates by almost $1 billion this quarter and Amazon will look to report similar success.  **AI**  Microsoft has OpenAI, we all know this. Amazon wanted in on the AI space and and in Sept announcing a deal to invest up to $4 billion in OpenAI competitor Anthropic. Additionally, in April, Amazon launched Amazon Bedrock, a service that allows users of Amazon's AWS to create generative AI applications. During the earnings call, I'm interested in hearing if there are any gains from its AI efforts. As mentioned earlier, the rise in AI causes more people to use cloud computing services like AWS.   **What do the experts say?**  BofA Global Research analyst Justin Post mentioned stuff that I've already written up here in a research note, stating that AWS is the Street’s top focus area, with some third-party sources suggesting that demand has decelerated. He's specifically betting on 12.5% growth for AWS, but cautions that a number in the 11% range would likely trigger selling. But further ads that a number above 13% would likely spur the stock higher.  On top of this, Post says aggregated credit and debit card data suggests online spending rose 1% from a year ago in the quarter, a two point acceleration from the June quarter. And he notes that “ad spending checks were also constructive.”  “We see retail upside potential driven by logistics efficiency, ads, fee increases, and easing comps,” Post writes “while we think AWS can accelerate in Q4 with more acceleration in Q1 2024 on an easing optimization cycle and incremental AI demand.” Post keeps his Buy rating and $174 target price on the stock. Mind you, the stock is literally at $118 right now.   **What to do for earnings**  My magic 8-ball says both revenue and EPS could outpace the estimates. Alright Degens, here's the play: I'm grabbing some AMZN 10/27 125c @ 2.04 each.  If Amazon rockets just 7%, those calls are hitting pay dirt. 🚀  Get your war paint on, it’s earnings season. 🎰🔥";"89";"2023-10-26T18:45:48"

"NVIDIA will cross 2,000$";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1arrumb/nvidia_will_cross_2000/";"NVIDIA is going to cross 2,000$  Listen up regards, today lord Sam 7 trillion Altman of OpenAI released an AI model to send YouTube creators out of business. (Link : https://openai.com/sora) Ok, YouTubers will soon run out of Tendies, how does this mean NVIDIA will reach 2000$ you ask?   Well to see the connection you need to understand a bit of AI. There are 2 big models that currently exist: Transformers and Diffusion. The thing about transformers is that they operate on tokens. For language a bunch of letters together form a token. “ab” can be 1 token, “can” another token and so on. Basically they do not think in terms of single alphabets but actually think in terms of tokens. So OpenAI took 100 million Microsoft bucks, 1 billion+ NVIDIA GPU’s and created ChatGPT that started this AI bull run.   Then came the question how to apply this technique to images. Naively each image generates far more tokens than a thousand word essay and so understanding an image seems extremely inefficient. Transformers will not work, smooth brained critics said. Then Sam Altman pulled the infinite money Microsoft glitch and OpenAI trained a massively large transformer on an ungodly number of GPUs and showed we could perfectly understand images with GPT-4.   “Well ok maybe images work, but this will never work for videos, that would require an insane amount of compute”, smooth brained critics said. It turns out these critics just lacked imagination since Sam Altman proceeded to ask for 7 trillion dollars, more than the GDP of every country except US and China to throw more compute at AI. So when OpenAI says they will just brute force AI, throw trillions of compute at it and achieve AGI you better believe them. They have now come out with a transformer based Video Diffusion model. They never mentioned how big this model is, but it is probably bigger than GPT-4 . GPT-5 which is rumored to be able to understand and answer questions on video, is probably one order of magnitude bigger than GPT-4 and might cost 1 billion + to train. This means the market is still significantly underestimating the demand for NVIDIA chips and NVIDIAs price target should be 2000$ + in coming future.  TLDR: OpenAI’s foray into video using transformers shows there is far more compute they can use to generate even better AI’s. They will probably buy 10X the compute they already bought, from NVIDIA in the coming years in their quest to build AI. NVIDIA will skyrocket as a result.";"0";"2024-02-15T23:12:18"

Here are all the reasons why not to like Apple right now  * Fall in phone sales especially in China * They have been absolutely sideways for the past 12 months and down \~9% for the year. * Things are going to look bad for this quarter that's a given. * Apple Vision is not selling well (give that thing a controller and games my god) * Regulators are breathing down their neck (I do feel some of it is justified regardless of what Cramer says) * It's been absent in this AI bonanza - probably their worst offense  However, with all of that said there is one thing that Apple has in its perpetual back pocket.  Install Base & Great Product recognition  Before I get into 2 companies that Apple will absolutely trounce, I want to talk about a prediction that is coming for their upcoming June developer conference.  Apple will 1000% announce their AI strategy. It is a foregone conclusion they will do this and in a meaningful way. If they don't do this it would be corporate malfeasance and Tim Cook should resign immediately. But why?  AI is something that YOU MUST get out the door and have people using it. It's not web search where you can make a deal with Google to use their AI offering. And BTW if you think that deal is going to happen with Google it 1000% is not. Apple would insane to do that. You have get your models up, trained and running. If you don't they can never improve. They can't get more training data. And, Apple is already reporting that they have models that are performing well.  ~~To pay Google or anyone for Models when Meta is just releasing models for free right now is a non-starter. Apple will make their own AI models.~~  Apparently not. Apple is now talking to OpenAI too. So Apple using Microsoft. lol hmmm. Interesting.  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true)  The fact that Apple isn't even look to compete with their own models is just wild to me.   As much as I wish Microsoft and or OpenAI would do a hardware device (regarding AI), Apple has the install base to do something meaningful and in a big way with consumers. Literally, this can be another vertical for Apple.  Other hardware, such as ""The PIN"" and ""the Rabbit"" are horrible devices. The Rabbit is OK but it is beyond obvious that your phone is going to be able to do what those devices do shortly. Literally, all Apple has to do is look at anything worthwhile on those devices, what's not worthwhile on them and come out with a future Iphone that does all that and more. It will be like taking candy from a baby.  Edge AI, in my opinion is going to be a great game changer and very practical use case for what profitable AI will look like. Whether it's a Robot or your HER / hand-held device edge AI is where this all goes.  Samsung has already begun AI on the phone and I don't really use it because of 1 reason. It's not a great foundational model like OpenAI's ChatGPT or anything good that is native on the phone. And this is the beautiful thing about Apple. If Apple can just be good enough with their AI models - They're opportunity is different than any other player in the mobile space. They can put a model that they make directly on the phone. True Edge AI. Nobody else has the opportunity to do that in the way Apple does. This will make the AI faster, more responsive, great computer vision, audio capabilities will all be native on the phone.  All for $20 / $30 a month that Apple sheep will be happy to pay for.  Look for Apple to begin that story this June.  My position: Currently I have 1 share but I think now is the time.";"49";"2024-04-27T04:00:49"

These companies all have monopolies and no one cares and can continue to die wherever they want to print money  Risks:  Google lost their app store monopoly lawsuit   Amazon loses money to run an unprofitable retail business to get a monopoly. Everyone else has comparable offerings to AWS.  Meta and Google: these are social media plays. The easiest way to destroy America or influence it's politics is via Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube. Foreign governments and local politicians all dump money into these platforms to cause civil unrest and pollute minds.  Risks: Eventually America might actually fall and social media won't be useful anymore. Alternatively, America will topple the governments of the countries doing this, such as Russia and China. Low risk of either outcome.  Nvidia and Tesla. Enron style financial scams. These companies play financial shell games and provide lines of credit to shell companies and broke customers so they can buy their products on paper and manipulate their product prices upwards. Thankfully, Enron ran for almost a decade before it blew up and these companies have only a few years of shady finances, 5 at most for Telsa and less for Nvidia.

BB phones were practical, resilient, and most importantly *secure* for a device of that era.  So like a bitch in heat, I passionately purchased calls earlier today.

Cybersecurity companies such as CrowdStrike, Palo Alto and IBM, make it difficult for BB to get their foot in the door. Not to mention there's tons of posts from actual IT/Security folk on reddit that have moved away or avoided using Cyclance, BB's security platform.

Thankfully the foundations of some Open Source Software technology is well founded for the purpose of making core and important technologies available in a pure Open Source Software way.  * The Linux Foundation * Linux Kernel Development * Apache Software Foundation * Mozilla Foundation * Free Software Foundation * OSI * Google Summer of Code GSoC * Chrome  Just to name a few. These foundations are powered by money from the biggest names in tech and that often are never realized by regular non-tech industry people and more so they sure the hell aren't even thanked by anyone really for doing it.  From individual contributors to  * IBM * Microsoft * Google * ARM * Apple * Oracle * Many Others  All give real dollars to these projects to stay alive and afloat.  However, other Open Source Software goes into the business without great institutional support. Examples of this are even publicly traded companies such as MongoDB.  They give you Open Source Software but they also provide a hand holding version via their cloud business.  Redis is another great example of this but they are not publicly traded.  Other Open Source Software such as Risc-V has other plans of profiting and that is completely OK. I just think the mistake is thinking someone is going to jump in with free software and that is going to kill someone else business.  Remember when Microsoft damn near cried (joking) when Linux arrived? What happened? Well, now Ubuntu is probably the most dominant OS on the planet BECAUSE of all the cloud vendors providing it for cloud compute. You wouldn't realize Linux is the most dominant OS but it is.  With data centers, Android, and you could argue Unix(Apple) is all Linux kernel based.  For this reason Open Source Software is the dominant OS on the planet developed by 1 man. Crazy.  As you see Microsoft sure does well even though the other reality people may not realize is something different.  With all of that there is nothing that prevents ARM using Risc-V as their own architecture IF they actually wanted to. The same as there was nothing stopping Microsoft from using Chrome in their Edge browser. If it makes financial sense they'll do it.  Hardware is HARD. The upward hill climb for Open Source Software to be the exact thing your billion dollar business needs without ANY help/consulting or tooling is NET ZERO. Somewhere in that cycle there is going to be something you pay for. Again, Open Source Software does NOT MEAN FREE.  ARM has a ridiculously LOW royalty rate to boot. It's not like their getting a dollar a phone they're getting PENNIES for all that goodness.  Still there is room for others such as Risc-V.  Lastly, ARMS army of patents is nothing to sleep on and at \~7000 patents is the definition of a MOAT if you ask me and an R&D in the 100's of millions I don't think you're going to get Open Source Software penetrating that for years to come.  Top that off with AI and well you see where this is going...  Cathie - If you're listening - here's your DD now do the right thing.";"9";"2024-02-08T02:32:42"

"""Why did the Dot Com bubble burst?""";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17m6o83/why_did_the_dot_com_bubble_burst/";""" It’s always difficult to identify a single catalyst that causes the bursting of an asset bubble, but in the case of the internet bubble, two factors seem to have played at least some part in the industry’s rapid decline, which began after the tech-heavy [Nasdaq composite](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/n/nasdaq-composite) peaked on March 10th, 2000.  The first factor was rising interest rates. The [Federal Reserve](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/f/federal-reserve) raised the [fed funds rate](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/f/fed-funds-rate) (which informs most other interest rates) several times over the course of the years 1999 and 2000. Higher interest rates tend to motivate investors to move money out of more speculative assets (like internet company stocks) and into interest-paying assets like bonds.  The second factor was the onset of a [recession](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/r/recession) in Japan in March of 2000. News of this recession spread fast and led to a wave of fear that triggered a worldwide selloff, moving even more money out of speculative equities and into safer, fixed-income instruments like bonds.""  **HMMM, it really seems like this is exactly what's happening now. The FED is going to increase interest rates, which will kill startups. The venture capital will dry up when investors realize that bonds are safer than the stock market. Earnings only look good right now because of inflation, and sky high PE ratios will soar on bad earnings. Hedges will switch strategy to shorting the market once they realize there is more money to be made off of puts than on calls. China is already hitting major economic turmoil which will have global effects. Consumers will not have any money to spend on goods because they all have 20% car loans and 9% mortgages, and their 500 dollar student loan payments just resumed. The AI revolution is basically just a sham. The current developments are by definition only ""deep learning"" and are not even close to being considered genuine AI.**  *WE ARE SETTING UP THE NEW BULL MARKET BOYS!!!!!!!*  &#x200B:  &#x200B:  &#x200B:";"101";"2023-11-02T16:55:52"

How much and when? I'm trying to figure it out.   Just imagine everything you already do with Office 365. Now imagine AI doing all that work for you with copilot! Soon with AI integration you will be able to do hours of work in seconds with just a few text prompts. “Summarize this email and create action items”, “build a PowerPoint from this pdf content”, “create an excel document summarizing financials from my customer orders” and the list goes on.  Microsoft wants to charge customers $30/month. Which for the hours it can save an employee should be adopted by at least 50% of their user base. Thats Billions in additional revenue a year.

"Enough with the doomsday theories.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18mdm1d/enough_with_the_doomsday_theories/";"Why is everyone suddenly promoting doomsday theories of imminent collapse and despair?  There’s a few issues people need to understand.  1. The 2008 financial crisis happened due to financial deregulation under Clinton (glass stegal) with banks assuming too much risk.   For example sub prime lending. Wallstreet institutions taking on risky mortgages that people can’t afford to pay.  The banks are now regulated under the bi partisan Dodd frank act  2. Inflation   There are parts to inflation that are directly caused by the fed and some the fed can’t control  Fed can control asset prices like buying mortgage back securities   Fed cannot control consumer prices, and inflation in consumer prices have more to do with supply of goods.   This however can be controlled by policy makers  Like adding china to the WTO to export inflation to 3rd world countries. (Slave factories making your iPhone)  The fed can influence the demand of goods by raising and lowering interest rates. But there no guarantee people will act the way the fed expects.   3.  American exceptionalism   America has an advantage that other countries don’t.  our technological innovation keeps us ahead of the curb.   There is no competition with apple  There is no competition with google  There is no competition with Microsoft  4. Market cycles   Markets move in cycles. Markets will usually hit a peak go down and rise up again. There is no need to panic, as knowing this you can profit both ways.  Conclusion.  There is no reason to cite doomsday scenarios as it’s unproductive. The United States is the most powerful country in the world. You don’t become that with idiots running your country. While nothing’s perfect. Be thankful you don’t have to walk 10 miles a day to get water 💧 as some people in the world do.   It’s all about perspective.

"Arbitraging the AI potential misspriced in some stocks that will become the leaders";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18cwbiq/arbitraging_the_ai_potential_misspriced_in_some/";"**GOOGLE**I have been very bullish on Google given MSFT stock performance but for some reason the market has been lagging. MSFT has been driven up, up and up based on Sam Altman, Open AI, GPT, and AI, AI, AI. The Bing supposedly takeover of Google Search was a FIASCO, won't happen.  Google's Deep Mind is another level. Not a generative text bullshitting your prompts. Google is the only actor that has been serious on AI since 2015. Now they are proving to you - have you seen the Gemini AI release? [Google launches its largest and ‘most capable’ AI model, Gemini](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/06/google-launches-its-largest-and-most-capable-ai-model-gemini.html)  Google should be trading in the 160$ range by now - But it's ok, market is lagging.  Ignore AI, google without AI is the best tech business you can buy.  **AMD**  Just anounced: [Meta and Microsoft say they will buy AMD’s new AI chip as an alternative to Nvidia’s](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/06/meta-and-microsoft-to-buy-amds-new-ai-chip-as-alternative-to-nvidia.html)  It is a matter of time that NVIDIA loses its momentum. It was nice to see a 1200% YoY revenue growth - that's really impresive. But... AMD and other actors want a piece of that cake, NVIDIA won't be able to eat it alone for longer. Chip buyers are already feeling the supply shortage or overprice in their pockets so they are looking for alternatives. AMD is the next best player known, right?  AMD hasn't rallied like NVIDIA. It is still trading as pre-AI thing.  &#x200B:  These are the 2 most clear companies that you can buy at a fair to cheap valuation. I am not touching MSFT, nor NVIDIA, nor APPLE at this valuation. Either AMZN, AMD or GOOGL run a 2x from current level or the other 3 mentioned have a correction of 30% to 40%.  Not a financial advice. Good luck.";"9";"2023-12-07T15:06:11"
"BIG WEEK AHEAD";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c9x8pg/big_week_ahead/";"This week could set expectations in the market till the end of the year.  We have five of the Magnificent Seven reporting and big economic news:     Monday :  Truist and Zions reports. This will be a good test for the health of Regional Banks & commercial Real estate. TFC and Zion expected earnings both to decline 26%. A good beat will be a healthy a sign.  Tuesday:  GE is expected to kill it with a 159% increase in earnings. It’ll be interesting with forward guidance considering the big trouble at Boeing.  RTX is expected to be flat with earnings, but with the recent $95B military aid package passed, I would think amazing guidance.  TSLA - big day with expected earnings to be down 41%.  Elon needs to pull a rabbit out of the hat!  Wednesday: Durable Goods Orders  0.3% expected with the last report of 0.5%.  BA earnings are expected to further diminish by an additional negative 12.5%. Wonder if they plan to name the new CEO?  Big Daddy Meta to report with estimated earnings almost doubling to $4.36.  High bar!  Thursday:  GDP estimated 2.4% versus 3.4% yoy.  CAT estimates are earnings up 4%. I would think the Infrastructure Bill to kick in by now.  Microsoft earnings expected to be up 13.7 % - low bar they need to double back flip over it.  Then GOOG expected earnings up 22%.  The band on TikToc will be interesting on the price action for Google & Meta this week.  Big AMZN expected earnings down 17% low bar - I like Amazon.    Friday:  The Fed’s favorite PCE yoy estimated 0.3% -  flat compared to prior 0.3%.  Core PCE less food & energy 0.3% - again flat versus prior of 0.3.    If your looking for action - here it comes.  I think TSLA’s robo-taxi is science fiction- they are struggling with execution ie. Cyber truck. Inflation data will move the market if good or bad.  Is there another 5% down this week? Maybe, but I’m staying in.  I did buy some protective calls on SQQQ and SPY puts to hedge encase of downside.  Opinion only.";"341";"2024-04-22T02:27:09"
"BIG WEEK AHEAD";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1acv8by/big_week_ahead/";"We have Fed speak and six significant earnings reports with forward guidance this coming week.  My thoughts:  JPOW & Committee has no reason at all to do six rate cuts this year so far.  Too bad - the economy would boom otherwise.  He won’t declare victory and most likely will remain cautious.  I think the market needs to get over the Fed and move on.      Tuesday the fun begins:  MSFT -  red hot!   The tunes are full blast - can they dance?   They have three businesses to report on plus AI.  Microsoft 365, Asure cloud, & personal computing- XBOX, Bing, Surface, and Activision.  Their yoy earnings is expected to increase 19%.  They been pushing AI close to two years now - show me the money!  Would like to see  yoy revenue growth of at least 25% based on their price. I think they are over bought.    GOOGL -  is expected to grow earnings by 53% to roughly $ 1.61.  Let’s see how search and YouTube does.  Maybe they have a new AI story to tell.  Over bought I think.     AMD -  is expected to grow earnings by 12% to roughly $0.77.   It’ll be about forward guidance I believe.   I like what I hear about the 8000G processors with lower power graphics and innovative content creation capabilities.   They have a strong story as well with their neural processing unit(NPU) Ryzen A for PC’s. Over bought but will continue to kick ass I think.  Thursday:  AAPL - is expected to grow earnings 12% with flat yoy revenue.  Really don’t see any surprise to the upside.  Heard the Apple Pro Vision isn’t gaining any app’s on Netflix’s.    Really no growth story so far.  Sell.   AMZN -big Q upcoming.   They need to demonstrate they can make big money.  They are expected to grow earnings from $0.03 to 0.79/share.  Use them a lot - we’ll see.  Meta - expected to grow earnings by 66% to $5 roughly.  Meta plans to have 350,000 Nvidia H100 chips to drive its data centers & AI by end of 2024. Year of efficiency is over I think.     I’m hoping for a flat week, but do have puts on MSFT & APPL.   My opinion only.   Your thoughts!";"282";"2024-01-28T06:28:20"
