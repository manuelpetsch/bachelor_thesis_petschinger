"Microsoft $MSFT at all time high!";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/17s8uuv/microsoft_msft_at_all_time_high/";"Microsoft $MSFT shares rose nearly 1.7% on Friday to $366.63, hitting an all-time for the tech giant.  Shares have climbed more than 11% over the past month, resulting in the Satya Nadella-led firm having a market cap of $2.7T. Investor sentiment has been buoyed by the company's recent quarterly results, which showed better-than-expected growth at its Azure cloud unit, as well as a drop in interest rates.  Earlier this week, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said Microsoft $MSFT is in one of the best buy cycles seen in a long time, and the deployment of artificial intelligence can catapult its success even further.";"391";"2023-11-10T18:19:01"
"Microsoft Expands AI and Cloud Infrastructure Globally ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1avv7j5/microsoft_expands_ai_and_cloud_infrastructure/";"Microsoft is making significant strides in artificial intelligence and cloud infrastructure, with a notable investment of $2.1 billion in Spain over the next two years, as announced by the company’s Vice Chair and President, Brad Smith.  This commitment comes in addition to a recent pledge of nearly $3.5 billion for AI investment in Germany during the same period, part of Microsoft’s global push for AI advancements.  Spain’s Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, highlighted that Microsoft’s investment in the country will quadruple, reaching €1.95 billion. Cooperation opportunities are also being explored to strengthen cybersecurity and promote AI in public administration.   As a major player in the AI landscape, Microsoft holds a 49% stake in OpenAI, demonstrating its substantial investment in generative-AI technology. Recent reports suggest that OpenAI is developing a search engine to directly compete with Google, powered in part by Microsoft’s Bing search engine. This move positions Microsoft as a formidable contender in the search engine market, leveraging its advancements in AI technology.  While Google currently holds the throne in the search engine realm, Microsoft’s noteworthy progress in AI technology hints at the potential for a significant shift in dynamics. Could 2024 mark a turning point where Microsoft challenges Google’s supremacy in the search engine market?  (Via Microsoft Start) ";"12";"2024-02-20T23:39:00"
"Microsoft SASE Questions";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/15sjiva/microsoft_sase_questions/";"Hi all,  I'd like to understand the market behavior around a series of events.  Microsoft announced they're expanding into SASE, which immediately drops all the long-term big players in that market. https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/12/palo-alto-networks-and-zscaler-tumble-as-microsoft-expands-in-security.html  Meanwhile, nearly in concert with that announcement, MS products suffer multiple major breaches, leading to DHS investigation and involvement.  https://www.npr.org/2023/07/12/1187208383/china-hack-us-government-microsoft   https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-cyber-safety-review-board-assess-online-intrusion-microsoft-exchange-dhs-2023-08-11/ ...etc.  The drop in SASE competitors I can understand in a vacuum, as it would be expected they would suffer competitive Disruption from Microsoft simply because of ease of integration with the existing platform.  However after all the news around the breaches, some other vulnerability announcements, and now the DHS investigation spawned by the MS breaches, MSFT hasn't really fallen noticeably, and PANW, ZS, havent really turned back up (although PANW has an earnings call this week). Cisco dropped and recovered quickly, as did Fortinet (until the 4th of August anyway).  Why is MSFT pricing untroubled by their breaches and associated scrutiny? Something like that on any of their competitors in the cyber space would nose-dive the stock. Alternatively, I'm unclear why MSFT in the SASE offering offers such threat to their competitors for Disruption given MSFTs trends on vulnerability patching and security issues.  I can only presume this is the cyber version of ""too big to fail,"" because they have such a massive portfolio and footprint that even with the bad press theyre just able to shrug it off and still be disruptive, even to longer-term successful players in that space?

"Nintendo Analysis_2";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/193rnfn/nintendo_analysis_2/";"&#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/aacrbmf8bqbc1.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0eb4388c738b307e56f558c86757d9ab995d3f8  **Growth**   Nintendo 3 years average growth is 7%, and EPS growth is 20%. The revenue growth is lower compared with its peers, like Play Station and Xbox. The EPS growth is good, but not outstanding, lower than game developers Capcom, Koei Tecmo, and Square Enix. Koei Tecmo and Capcom have delivered impressive growth in the last three years. Play Station and Take-Two achieved high revenue growth but did not drive their profit increase.   From the growth data comparison, I think Nintendo needs new drivers for the next generation. It plans to increase capital investment in IP expansion and initiate more people access to its dedicated game platform, but I think it not be the main driver in the next competition.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/wy755mkcbqbc1.png?width=1788&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9bc04616c101093b1798d2b9f14e29c3b72a876     **Profit**   Nintendo has good profit margins with a gross margin of 55% and an operating margin of 32%. This is higher than most competitors. Koei Tecmo and Capcom are more attractive, but they don't have a platform. Compared with Sony Play Station and Sega, Nintendo's performance is better. I can't find the margin data of the Gaming business from Microsoft's financial report, so I use the personal segment data, maybe this is not exact.   Although Nintendo has a decline in cash turnover compared with its history, Nintendo did much better than its competitors. Considering its good margins, I think Nintendo has strong profitability and return.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/ezlyxlkibqbc1.png?width=1425&format=png&auto=webp&s=73542e6b3049e56759f04de34918ee52d9585cc0     **Returns**   Nintendo has an outstanding investment return of 46% and an equity return of 21% compared with its competitors, especially in investment return. I think this benefited from a great composite of solid margins and a high cash turnover rate.   Again, I use the company's whole business ROE of Microsoft as I can't get the gaming sector number to calculate it. Considering Microsoft's main business is office software and cloud, this ROE number may not be comparable. ROIC is re-calculated by gaming sector data, and so is Sony Gaming & Network business, Nintendo is performing much better in ROIC than Microsoft Xbox and Sony Play Station.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/j2tv1r4kbqbc1.png?width=1285&format=png&auto=webp&s=a33f8581ffe44439c9dd84751298d915c4b31914     **Capital Structure**   All game companies here have low financial leverage with a leverage ratio below 0.5 except Sony. Nintendo has no debt on the balance sheet and strong solvency ability.   Every company's Debt to EBITDA is below 4, which means their financial is health and has no insolvency risk.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/jyl876olbqbc1.png?width=1794&format=png&auto=webp&s=53904f07faaf549c72a430a7c975799a1a54458b     **Valuation & Dividend**   Nintendo has a better valuation compared with its main competitors, after the recent soaring of price, Nintendo's current EV/EBIT is 13.68x, it's a little higher than the median line of 13x. I think Nintendo's valuation is not expensive considering its current solid financial performance in the first half of FY2023 and the potential to open another growth cycle through new console releases.   As a potential new Switch release this year, we can see some clues from its data in history. Nintendo's EV/EBIT was 15.03x and 30.8x in 2006 and 2016, which is the year the new console was released. Of course, I assume Nintendo's next Switch will perform like Wii and Switch, not Wii U. After the new console is released, Nintendo's market cap increased by 2.5x and 1x in the following 2 years, its EV/EBIT is stable and declined little compared with the released year, which means Nintendo delivers rich profit returns after the new console is released. Back today, Nintendo's valuation multiple is lower than in history, but its market role is still strong, and financial performance is solid, this is not a very high risk to bet its good returns on the eve of a new Switch release.   Nintendo has a good dividend payout ratio of around 50% compared with peers, which will define Nintendo as a value stock. I think Nintendo is not very attractive for buy-and-hold investors as it has highly volatile growth and market value, but it's a special opportunity you should consider when it prepares to add fuel to its tank, and you already know it's not too expensive, and has a stable dividend payout.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/42c8pusmbqbc1.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=520d675b1bc6451989a0538b054c094f67388cad     **Big Three Comparison**   As a game company with hardware and software, Nintendo's main competitors are Sony's Play Station and Microsoft's Xbox. To compare more clearly, I searched some data focusing on the three companies and their gaming business operating results, this can help me get a clear picture to understand the market position of the three companies. As Microsoft's gaming business data is not disclosed too much, the comparison focuses on Sony and Nintendo. All data used from the last quarterly financial report.   From growth data, Play Station has the highest revenue growth but the lowest profit growth, while Nintendo has the highest profit growth and moderates revenue growth. Microsoft has the lowest revenue growth and higher profit growth. I think all three companies perform well, but I prefer Nintendo because it balances well in revenue and profit growth, you can see more growth in revenue can drive higher profit growth. Xbox X & S has bad sales compared with Switch and PS5. Microsoft may release its new console this year and maybe increase some market shares, especially after it acquired Activision Blizzard. But I don't believe this can change the market structure. Maybe Microsoft has another idea to get money from gaming competition, providing cloud technologies and promoting cloud gaming development. You know, Nintendo online playing uses cloud services from Azure.   Play station's revenue was boosted by PS5 sales. Sony finally prepared enough stock to sell in the shop, you can find PS5 in every gaming shop and Costco. Sony's G & N business doing well this year, but its margin is too low compared with the other two. Sony has tonnes of popular IPs and first-party studios, I think it can do better in the gaming market and up its margin.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/1jl69zynbqbc1.png?width=1785&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9d3561d7a7702df3e4372d4738a3b133f76bd50     Moving to hardware and software sales data, Sony has the highest volume sold in console and software which is driven by PS5. Nintendo achieved surprising console sold and solid software titles sold, but I think Switch volume growth will not persist, and Nintendo needs to prepare something to compete with PS5 and the new Xbox. Microsoft's Xbox X & S has walked to the end of its life as the lowest console sold compared with others. I hope to see its new Xbox this year.   For Player and platform member data, Xbox has more active users but I think this is surpassed by Play Station as Sony has said its active users achieved 123m in its CES two days later. Sony currently has bigger subscribers compared with Nintendo Online and Microsoft GPX. Nintendo has 38m subscribers, which is in the middle.   The cumulative console sold data tells me Nintendo is the biggest one in the market, but considering the Switch is a very old console, I decided to add PS4 and Xbox ONE back, after adding, Sony is the biggest one with a total of 157m units sold, and Nintendo is 132m sold, Xbox is still the lowest units sold of 77.6m. The video game market is still dominated by Sony and Nintendo.     **Conclusion**   Nintendo is doing well compared with its competitors with high-quality growth, strong margins, turnover and investment return, lower insolvency risk, and fair valuation. But Nintendo's growth is already showing signs of weakness, and I think the recent growth in Switch is driven by Legend of Zelda Tears of Kingdom. This trend will not persist in the next year without new console or titles, especially at the time the PS5 Slim has been released and the new Xbox coming. Sony and Nintendo have dominated the video gaming world, and from market shares, Sony is even better than Nintendo. But Sony Play Station's low profitability is putting it in the shadow of Nintendo.

Nvidia shares NVDA,A fell 3% after hours, following a 3.1% gain to close at $418.76, while AMD shares AMD, also fell 3%, after a 2.7% gain in the regular session to close at $110.39.  Late Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported the Commerce Department could further block sales of AI chips to China unless U.S. companies first obtain a special license.  The ban would follow upon similar actions last year that threatened $400 million in Nvidia sales, but the company found a workaround in supplying a version of products that avoided the ban.  Both Nvidia and AMD have launched new AI chips this year: Nvidia in March and AMD earlier in the month. Last year’s release of Open AI’s ChatGPT generative AI — with billions of dollars invested by Microsoft Corp.

We have 100k more to throw in but we wanted to take a chance on individual stocks. This is the list we came up with, it looks generic but they seem to be good performers (except the last one).

"ATH | Leverage | Index Funds and more";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/17p3k55/ath_leverage_index_funds_and_more/";"I got a few questions as a newbie  &#x200B:  1. Some of the companies I want to invest long-term are either at their ATH or close to ATH, like Microsoft  or Nvidia. I'm wondering whether I should wait for it to drop, because most of the stock market is green this year, so I have a feeling it may drop since it grew so much, what do you think? Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy 2. Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? 3. Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow?  4. Stock Math  - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back? Logically the first answer, but something doesn't give me a peace of mind here, so I prefer to ask 5. Eli Lilly - what do you think about this stock? Growed massive amount lately, and pharmaceutical industry will definitely be there in 5 or 10 years.";"0";"2023-11-06T15:10:12"
"Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/19esa5z/why_am_i_bullish_on_sfy_instead_of_spy/";"A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings:  https://preview.redd.it/evtbd2dnkgec1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=47c5c6d9f58e6997aad5330dba32ff543e2c8541  Data Sources:  * SPY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/spy/holdings/)​​, [Schwab](https://www.schwab.wallst.com/schwab/Prospect/research/etfs/schwabETF/index.asp?type=holdings&symbol=SPY)​​, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/?guccounter=1)​​. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST)​ * SFY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/sfy/holdings/)​​, [Zacks.com](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/SFY/holding)​​, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SFY/holdings/)​​. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST)  **Key Observations:**  * Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. * Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. * Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting.  It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation.  I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors:  1. **Expense Ratio**: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. 2. **Stock Selection Methodology**: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. 3. **Performance Trends**: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. 4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. 5. **Market Positioning**: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. 6. **Innovative Approach of SoFi**: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.  It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.  **What are your thoughts?**";"0";"2024-01-24T22:46:21"

"It's time to close the principal position on NetEase";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/19evm51/its_time_to_close_the_principal_position_on/";" It's time to finish the principal investment at $102 after NTE's rebound in the last three days. The main reasons push the price high were the policy page missing from the GAPP website which led the investors to think the new regulation in Living Gaming would remain the same, and the market rebound as the decline of the bank's deposit requirement. Although some catalysts still do not occur, like the process with Blizzard, which was acquired by Microsoft last year, I think it is better to execute the profit realized and principal protection action.

"A Post-Earnings Review of Alphabet (GOOG)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/15bbp1h/a_postearnings_review_of_alphabet_goog/";"I'm a big fan of making things more visual rather than a whole lot of text, so here's a rundown of some key things from Alphabet's latest earnings.   # The Cloud Market Share  First up, cloud market share. Conveniently, Microsoft released numbers as well this week so we can lump Azure into this. Amazon has not yet given us an update on AWS, but we should get that next week. For now, here's a breakdown of how the Cloud market stacks up.   [AWS vs Azure vs Google Cloud](https://preview.redd.it/ujdyz4xqakeb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=77900a753697eb52ba6a328f5a219b3a9a10b1d4)  It should be noted that Microsoft does not break Azure out from a whole lot of other tools, I've assumed it's around two-thirds of ""Intelligent Cloud"" today. It could easily be +/- $5B from that $58.9B figure, but there's no confirmation of that.   Over time, Google Cloud and Azure are closing the gap on AWS. It's worth noting that the size of the pie is growing considerably, so AWS is still growing at a good pace, just Azure and Google Cloud have been growing a lot better recently.   &#x200B:  [AWS vs Google Cloud vs Azure over time](https://preview.redd.it/yqwy50b7bkeb1.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bf590948c039ac062ab41933ebb8a66bf8aa53a)  # YouTube vs Netflix  YouTube once again saw some decent advertising growth and it got me thinking... it's bigger than Netflix, right? Turns out it's pretty close on just advertising alone.   &#x200B:  [Netflix Streaming vs YouTube Ad Revenue](https://preview.redd.it/hr8y9fdfbkeb1.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&s=349f7763c9324eaf86297a208f4fbdde7fe50788)  Alphabet does not break out YouTube Premium subscription numbers, but once can be sure that the tally puts YouTube higher than Netflix streaming on a revenue basis. So, the next time Disney+ versus Max vs Netflix is brought up in a ""King of Streaming"" battle, just know that YouTube is sat quietly dominating in the background.   # Google Cloud's Profitable Year  Finally, Google Cloud is on track for a profitable year on an operating basis. It's not done that before, but the past two quarters have both been positive setting the stage for the company's first profitable year of cloud services.   &#x200B:  [Google Cloud operating income](https://preview.redd.it/gf92055ybkeb1.png?width=1316&format=png&auto=webp&s=febfa54c41fdbab7d96f035a52b3aa9c90c892c7)  # Suggestions / Requests?

Of the $59 million decrease in Cybersecurity revenue, $47 million of that was attributed to the product Blackberry Spark. Cylance deal aging poorly. Noted elongated sales cycles in government causing large deals to slip into later quarters.  It is worth noting they had a 90% retention rate of customers but inability to upsell in the cybersecurity market is untenable as there are high salary costs and infrastructure requirements. Most IT departments will seek to consolidate vendors for cost savings.  # IOT  Blackberry IVY in 235 million vehicles and seeks to be the preferred app store of IOT.  The increase in IoT revenue of $28 million was primarily due to an increase of $18 million in QNX development seat revenue and an increase of $15 million in BlackBerry QNX royalty revenue, partially offset by a decrease of $5 million relating to professional services.  The increase in IoT gross margin of $21 million was primarily due to the reasons discussed above in “Revenue by Segment”, partially offset by an increase in salaries expense.  The decrease in IoT gross margin percentage of 1% was primarily due to an increase in salaries expense within cost of goods sold. From revenue we can deduce a 14% increase in cost of doing total sales since Feb 2022.  # Licensing  MARCH 2023: The Company expects revenue from intellectual property licensing to be approximately $5 million per quarter in fiscal 2024, excluding the [Malikie Transaction](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2023/blackberry-announces-new-patent-sale-transaction-with-leading-patent-monetization-company-for-up-to-900-million) a deal which allowed them to make more money the more their product was licensed -- an interesting deal.  JUNE 2023:  The increase in Licensing and Other revenue of $231 million was primarily due to an increase of $218 million related to the completed Malikie Transaction and an increase of $13 million... The Company previously stated that it expected revenue from intellectual property licensing to be approximately $5 million per quarter in fiscal 2024... Revenue from intellectual property licensing was approximately $17 million excluding the Malikie Transaction.  # Takeaways  Increased cost of doing business, lower margins, and sliding timelines with government work pushing earnings into later quarters. Their Cybersecurity business is failing but if IVY is successful their AI driven endpoint security solution could provide a type of multi-access VPN for IOT and Enterprise of Things sector giving them a competitive advantage to newer companies entering emerging markets. However, they're likely to run into the same competitors like Crowdstrike and Microsoft. Microsoft's strategy is to allow other companies to develop a solution, embrace, overtake, destroy so it seems like Blackberry will have a tough time holding onto any market they may capture anyway.  People love this brand and it has a reputation for being secure. Now that the Malakie Transaction is finished, it will be interesting to see if they can maintain developments in their licensing business.

"My top ideas for next couple weeks";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1bzv07m/my_top_ideas_for_next_couple_weeks/";"Best long term buying opportunity (not recommend calls but trickling in slowly as still expecting downside risk)  United Healthcare - expect more downside but its stock prices have been going down while earnings have gone up.  Good combination for accumulation  Alibaba - harder to recommend after the recent bounce which is why it was moved from my best call idea, which is more of a short term call list, to a long term hold list  Dow jones - it broke the 50 day moving average so more downside expected but it’s closest to fair value compared to Nasdaq and s and p  McDonald - I would have it on my call list if it wasn’t for the risk of not knowing how much of the California new wage for fast food worker is built into sentiment.  But good long term hold because finally valuations are getting better, dividend is decent, and people are selling the stock forgetting/ignoring that California is such a small portion of its global market   Best call ideas Apple -oversold and ready for short term bounce but not a recommended medium term hold.  Also good stock to trickle in slowly and be ready for lot more volatility   AMD - terrible valuation and company but oversold going into earning calls.  People love to buy up semiconductor stocks last couple weeks before the call.  Good hedge if you want to short the tech or s and p index.     Best short ideas Gold - purely technical.  Way overbought   Amazon - single most overvalued tech stock in the magnificent seven and that’s really saying something.  Biggest risk to the short thesis is the earning call and people not wanting to sell leading into it and instead dumping after, which is why I only have a small position in Amazon in case it does sell of early but saving a big cash pile for major puts if it spikes after earning  Microsoft - completely overhyped.  Nothing more to say.  Energy stocks (XLE) - I took some profits on my puts I bought on Friday but look for opportunity to enter shorts after small bounce.  The most overbought sector in the entire s&P and oil price is unsustainable    Overall statement on the conditions of the market  Be very vigilant as we had into earnings call.  While the market as a whole is still ridiculously overvalued, if earning calls are good enough stock market will ignore/forget the fact that they already ran up expecting the good news.  I anticipate very bumpy 3 weeks.  I see S and P within 1% of all time high and Nasdaq within 1.5% of all time high as excellent short entries and around 5050 on s and p and 435 on the QQQ as strategic places to place bets for short term rebound.  My recommendation is to keep playing those 2 ranges until one either breaks or until after earnings call in which case it’s safe to short the market to hearts content  ";"15";"2024-04-09T17:28:52"
"Peg Ratio";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/17odn67/peg_ratio/";"Do you think a stock with a peg ratio lower than 2 is a good investment? I know that historically the best bargains are stocks which peg ratio are 1 or lower. However, I’ ve noticed many of the big companies have peg closer to 2 or more than 2   examples: Microsoft: 2.61, Google: 1.72, Meta:1,58 , etc  So, in order for their peg to be 1 or lower all these stocks pe ratios should fall between 13-16 and to be honest I don’t see that happening any time soon(I even think these stocks will keep a P/E ratio of at least 25 or 30 the next 3-5 years )  So do you think a peg ratio between 1 and 2 would be a better reference than the peg of 1 or lower ? Most of the stock I’ve reviewed seems to have pe ratios that double their growth rate If the stock projected growth rate is 10 it’s P/E ratio is close to  the 20s , if the expected growth is 15 the p/ e ratio is close to the 30s and so on. I think even the sp500 had a pe ratio of 20 when it delivered a 10% return last years(not sure about this one) But to me, it seems like that pe ratio would double the projected growth in most of the cases   Of course I might be totally wrong , so I appreciate any comments regarding this topic   Thank you so much for your time and help :)";"8";"2023-11-05T15:57:02"
"What could actually destabilize the stock market right now?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1aoqfgz/what_could_actually_destabilize_the_stock_market/";"I'll start. I want to read others opinions and ideas.      The general consensus right now is we're going through great weather in the stock market, smooth sailing. Maybe even a lot of confidence to be surfing the big waves. There are some things I see on the horizon.     1. The AI transition, although has the potential to do great things, is not being adopted so fast and in the pertient areas for actual economic growth. Because of this, AI as a tool for economic growth will plateu for a couple of years. Even though it's great, it has serious limitations right now and can't help whomever do something beyond their own capabilities to a degree that makes them as competent as an expert human being. Coding wise I can tell that much is certain. So I anticipate a disilusion coming from the AI expectations that are out there soon to bring the market down. Specially Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, etc. 2. There is a serious disconnect between low income and high income people. Low income being the vast majority. This is causing insecurity to rise and creep into areas where that wasn't a problem before. As a consequence... low income people will save instead of spend, and high income people will keep spending, creating an unrealistic measurement of how the economy is doing. This will keep inflation and the prices of goods from coming down, preventing economic growth to come from both low, medium and high income populations. Making the FED reconsider lowering rates as inflation numbers are updated. 3. Slowly but surely companies will let go of staff and the unemployment number will go up. Adding weight to the idea that raising rates is a no go for now. High unemployment levels can lead to decreased consumer spending, further slowing economic growth and complicating efforts to combat inflation. 4. Group monopolization: Tech companies and a relatively small group of companies are taking most of the pie. This imbalance will have an effect on the quality of goods being produced. Only a handful of options will be left to choose from and the will of entreprenours will be eroded from not being able to compete with companies who can keep financing the production of their products regardless of their bad quality. So a general lack of doing business motivation will permeate the air and consumers could attempt to simply stop purchasing and going the DIY route. 5. Europe in general seems to be in a hole. Swiss banks will have some turbulence in the near, medium term future: the debt of countries like Greece, Italy, Spain, etc will just start adding up and making the Euro currency to continue to lose value against other currencies. 6. Geopolitical tensions could escalate in different fronts and cause bottlenecks in production, transportation, travel, etc. You have the US-China relationship disputing technology and intellectual property rights and creating a competition with other countries for where goods are produced to be imported to the US. Escalation in tensions could bring about tariffs, sanctions, or retaliatory measures. There's also the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel-Gaza situation, Iran and Western countries over nuclear programs, other oil producing nations and the oil pricing situation. 7. US elections coming soon.     Considering this and the list below of what has triggered the US stock market to go down at least 20%, what do you see creeping up, potentially, as a catalyst for the market to flip to bear territory?     1. **1973-1974 Stock Market Crash**: Triggered by the oil crisis following the Yom Kippur War, when OAPEC (Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries) proclaimed an oil embargo. This, coupled with high inflation, stagnating economic growth (stagflation), and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, led to a severe bear market. 2. **Early 1980s Recession**: High inflation rates, exacerbated by oil price shocks and aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker to combat inflation, led to a severe recession and a significant market downturn in the early 1980s. 3. **Black Monday, 1987**: On October 19, 1987, stock markets around the world crashed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropping by 22% in a single day. Factors included trade deficits, rising interest rates, and overvaluation, but the crash was exacerbated by the widespread use of portfolio insurance and automated trading systems. 4. **Dot-com Bubble Burst, 2000-2002**: After years of speculative investment in internet-based companies, the bubble burst in 2000, leading to a significant market correction. Many tech companies saw their stock values plummet, leading to a broader market downturn and a mild recession. 5. **Global Financial Crisis, 2007-2009**: Triggered by the collapse of the housing bubble in the United States, leading to a crisis in subprime mortgages and a severe liquidity crunch. This crisis quickly spread globally, leading to significant declines in stock markets worldwide, bank failures, and a deep global recession. 6. **COVID-19 Pandemic, 2020**: The global outbreak of COVID-19 led to unprecedented economic disruption, as governments around the world imposed lockdowns and travel restrictions to combat the pandemic. The uncertainty and sudden stop in economic activity led to a sharp, but relatively short-lived, market downturn in March 2020.";"225";"2024-02-12T04:31:16"
"Apple becomes first U.S. company to reach $3 trillion market cap";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1493cw8/apple_becomes_first_us_company_to_reach_3/";"   * **Apple hit a market cap of $3 trillion briefly during trading on Monday.** * **The milestone is mostly symbolic but it represents investor recognition of Apple’s success over the past few years as the company has reported several record-breaking quarters of big growth in all of its product lines.** * **Apple’s cash flow also makes the stock a safe haven during times of market uncertainty.**  Apple briefly hit a market cap of $3 trillion during intraday trading on Monday, before dropping back under the mark shortly afterwards. Apple broke the barrier when its share price hit $182.86.  Apple rose 2.5% on Monday to close at $182.01, just missing closing the trading day at the $3 trillion mark.   The milestone is mostly symbolic but it shows investors remain bullish on Apple stock and its ability to grow. At a market value of $3 trillion, Apple tripled its valuation in under four years. And analysts see plenty of room to run.  Apple showed annual growth across all of its product categories in its fourth-quarter earnings, with revenue up 29% year-over-year. While the iPhone is still the biggest sales driver, Apple’s services business grew 25.6% year-over-year and delivered more than $18 billion in revenue during the quarter.   In December, for example, Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty raised the firm’s price target on Apple from $164 to $200, and maintained the equivalent of a buy rating, arguing that new products like virtual reality and augmented reality headsets aren’t yet baked into the share price.  Huberty also said she expects Apple’s App Store revenue to outperform Morgan Stanley’s forecasts for the quarter and for Apple to ship 83 million units during the December quarter, 3 million more than anticipated.  Apple sold 27 million pairs of its newest AirPods model over the holidays, driving 20% year-over-year growth for Apple’s wearables business during the quarter, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TFI Asset Management Limited said in a Monday note.  Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote on Sunday that the mark is a “watershed moment” but has more room to grow, especially since Ives values Apple’s services business at $1.5 trillion.  Investors also turned to Apple as a safe haven during recent market uncertainty, thanks to its strong balance sheet and prodigious cash flow, which it uses to invest in new products, stock buybacks and to return capital to shareholders through dividends.  Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to hit a $1 trillion market cap during intraday trading on Aug. 2, 2018. It hit a $2 trillion valuation just over two years later on Aug. 19, 2020.  Apple’s peers aren’t far behind. Microsoft is worth about $2.5 trillion, Amazon has about a $1.75 market cap and Google’s market valuation is just shy of $2 trillion.  Apple stock rose 34% in 2021.";"138";"2023-06-14T11:30:13"

"Don't miss out on the rebound: Grab these super stocks on the dip";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/13ojoib/dont_miss_out_on_the_rebound_grab_these_super/";"   ## 1. Confluent's largest customer cohort continues to outperform  Data streaming is a technology rapidly growing in importance for businesses because consumers are increasingly demanding more live experiences from their digital products and services. **Confluent** **(****CFLT****)** is a leader in the industry, and some of the largest companies in the world are flocking to its platform.  https://preview.redd.it/1d47wfra1c1b1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=18d11ba93beb4cb1dc036b0c617549b74d19a8d2     Cloud computing allows businesses to operate online, and every interaction within their digital ecosystem creates data. The ability to use that information instantly is a game changer for the customer experience: a retailer, for example, can manage inventory in real time so products never go out of stock. And an online sports betting platform can offer live markets during a game because data streaming allows them to calculate odds, feed them to the users, and accept bets -- all within seconds.  The technology has implications for almost every industry, and International Data Corp. predicts 90% of the world's 1,000 largest companies will be using it by 2025.   In the first quarter of 2023, Confluent generated $174.3 million in revenue, up 38% year over year and well above its $168 million forecast. But there was an even more impressive figure: The number of businesses spending $1 million or more on Confluent's platform surged 53% -- more than three times faster than the company's customer base grew overall.     ## 2. DigitalOcean continues to outgrow its trillion-dollar competitors  **DigitalOcean** **(****DOCN** **-2.30%)** is a provider of cloud computing services that allow its customers to store data, host websites, and even develop software. It has one significant point of difference from its major competitors like **Amazon** Web Services (AWS) and **Microsoft** Azure: DigitalOcean targets small to medium-sized businesses with under 500 employees.  https://preview.redd.it/j5ogu8pz1c1b1.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9d5ea9ad7f757754226d5a6593c27779b6bc798   It's a lucrative segment of the cloud market because DigitalOcean can develop a relationship with businesses in their start-up phase and then reap the financial rewards when they begin to scale up. The company offers personalized service, cheap pricing, and a simple cloud platform with one-click deployment tools designed to suit its target customers. Other cloud providers are more focused on large enterprise customers, so they don't typically offer a competing value proposition for small businesses.     As of Q1, DigitalOcean had 146,500 customers spending more than $50 per month. That includes 15,000 ""scalers,"" which are its top spenders, each contributing an average of $1,962 per month to DigitalOcean's revenue. Speaking of which, the company generated $165.1 million in revenue during the quarter, marking an increase of 30% year over year. That was a faster growth rate for the period than AWS (16%), Microsoft Azure (27%), and **Alphabet**'s Google Cloud (28%) delivered!  &#x200B:  ## 3. Redfin stock has soared 149% in 2023  **Redfin**'s **(****RDFN** **-4.18%)** got off to a strong start in 2023, with the stock price up 149% so far this year. But it's still down 88% from its all-time high. The real estate technology company struggled over the last 18 months because the U.S. Federal Reserve embarked on the most aggressive campaign to hike interest rates in its history to fight soaring inflation. That's directly impacting demand for housing because consumers can't afford to borrow as much money, leading to a slowdown in Redfin's business.  https://preview.redd.it/f9q0wwkd2c1b1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=09c39ca2be669cca3c9cb6df40d69816a7367bc1  Redfin employs 1,876 lead agents covering 98% of the U.S. housing market (geographically), allowing the company to operate at a level of scale that smaller independent realtors can't match. As a result, it charges listing fees as low as 1%, undercutting the more common rate of 2.5% and creating a win-win for Redfin and its sellers.  The company is so popular that it represented 0.78% of the nearly 2 million houses sold in America during the first quarter of 2023. That might not sound like a big number, but there are 3 million registered agents across the country, so Redfin is punching well above its weight.  Due to the absence of direct buying, Redfin's revenue crashed 45% in Q1 compared to the same quarter last year (as expected). But Redfin is now a much leaner, healthier business, and it expects to deliver positive non-GAAP earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) this year. That's primarily why investors have sent Redfin stock soaring in 2023, and it might just be getting warmed up.";"0";"2023-05-22T09:24:34"
"Everything you need to know about GME's earnings today";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/16bscyw/everything_you_need_to_know_about_gmes_earnings/";"GameStop will be reporting earnings from the most recent quarter today, we're expecting a loss of $0.14 per share.  We all know what happened in 2021 with the short squeeze. In fact, there's a new movie called Dumb Money that's all about it. But this post isn't about that. It's about today's earnings and whether or not calls (or puts) are a good idea. The company has been losing money for years and needs a bullish catalyst to help it turnaround.  **Key Factors**  [GameStop in June fired its chief executive](https://fortune.com/2023/06/07/gamestop-fires-ceo-names-ryan-cohen-executive-chairman/), Matthew Furlong, an Amazon veteran who had been appointed [two years earlier](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-names-amazon-executives-as-its-new-ceo-cfo-11623270149?mod=article_inline&mod=article_inline). The company in June also said its board had elected activist investor Ryan Cohen, the co-founder of online pet-supplies retailer Chewy, as executive chair.  The [press release](https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-election-ryan-cohen-executive-chairman) announcing that move offered little detail. But GameStop, in a filing, said Cohen’s leadership would “further unlock long-term value creation for our stockholders.” The company said it appointed Mark Robinson as general manager and principal executive officer.  In July, GameStop said Chief Financial Officer Diana Saadeh-Jajeh would [resign on Aug. 11.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-says-its-cfo-is-resigning-b00cc9c1?mod=mw_quote_news&mod=article_inline) Daniel Moore, it said then, would become interim principal financial officer.  Cohen’s influence over GameStop has grown since 2020. Under his guidance, the company [last year put a bigger focus on physical stores](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-stores-ryan-cohen-f67d3871) after stumbles in its e-commerce push.  “The videogame industry grew in [the second quarter], but a continuing digital mix shift likely impacted GameStop traffic,” [Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter](https://www.wedbush.com/analysts/michael-pachter/) said in a research note not too long ago. Pachter, in this note, said that growth in hardware, or things like consoles, for companies like Nintendo and Sony, as well as a “compelling” lineup for new games and other software, indicated potential good news for GameStop’s results during the second quarter. But he pointed to “underwhelming” hardware sales from Microsoft and said GameStop “appears to have lost market share in recent quarters,” adding that its collectibles business — which includes items like toys and trading cards — faces difficult comparisons. He also noted the threat from a broader migration toward digital, mobile and subscription gaming.  “There were notable new game releases such as Activision’s *Diablo IV* and Nintendo’s *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom*, with the majority of sales likely occurring digitally,” Pachter said.  In Gamestop's [2022 annual report](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/fe325562-c087-4fad-809c-efd183364196), the company highlighted a plan to cut costs (especially in Europe), improve vendor relationships and penetrate higher margin markets like collectibles and toys.  Just as important as earnings is guidance, however the company has not provided this metric in recent quarters. Still, from my research I see that analysts believe that the company will report third-quarter revenue of $1.159 million — implying a YOY decline of 2.34% — and an adjusted EPS loss of 14 cents. For the full year of 2023, analysts expect $5.706 billion of revenue and an adjusted EPS loss of 26 cents.  This does suck for GME, unfortunately it's not looking very good for share holders. However, the popularity in DRS shares is rising. Retail shareholders have enthusiastically adopted the practice of using the Direct Registration System (DRS). For those who don't know, the DRS allows investors to hold their shares through the company's transfer agent, Computershare. It eliminates the need to entrust shares to a broker or to possess a physical stock certificate, as was customary in the past.  By contrast, when individuals allow brokers to hold their shares, they're kept under the brokerage's ""street name,"" rather than the investor's name. Brokers may then loan these shares to short sellers, who require access to the stock of the companies they are betting against.  GameStop's DRS numbers are growing, last earning report, [they revealed that](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/gme/gamestop-stock-76-6-million-shares-registered-holders-with-gmes-transfer-agent) 76.6 million shares were held by registered owners through Computershare. This indicates that around 25% of GameStop's outstanding shares were in the transfer agent's custody as of June 1. It also represents an increase of approximately 600,000 shares from the previous quarter. GameStop is likely among the companies with the most outstanding shares registered with its transfer agent. Since October 2021, GameStop's management has considered this information ""material"" and has included it in the company's quarterly filings. However, this isn't indicative of a positive or negative earning report today. It just shows the ""ape"" mentality regarding GME.   For those who like to trade options, I'm going to get puts on GME. However, those who are holding shares, it's best to sell today before close. This is *not* financial advice tho.";"0";"2023-09-06T20:47:11"
"3 reasons to buy Shopify Stock ($SHOP)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/13szet7/3_reasons_to_buy_shopify_stock_shop/";"   * **Shopify's platform is boosting engagement.** * **Watch for higher margins, despite pressures from a tilt toward payments processing.**  ## The platform will likely see stronger earnings growth over the next few years.  Investors found many good reasons to like Shopify ($SHOP) in recent weeks. The e-commerce platform specialist reported solid operating results to start fiscal 2023, and its earnings prospects have improved with its pivot away from the costly shipping-logistics business. Shares responded by soaring in the wake of management's early May earnings update.  Yet investors might still be facing sticker shock from Shopify's pricey valuation. Let's look at a few reasons shares seem like a good buy, even following the latest rally.  ## 1. Concrete results  Wall Street's attention focused on Shopify's strategic pivot away from the logistics business, mainly because this move is likely to accelerate the company's return to profitability. Executives admitted to overextending themselves on spending in 2022, and the sale of the logistics platform represents an aggressive shift toward a simpler, more efficient business.  https://preview.redd.it/zrfonsbgtc2b1.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab137324490212add4b82c74c632e3f783f324c8  But investors also have concrete reasons to be optimistic about Shopify's current growth trends. Sales volumes rose a healthy 18% through late March. The company saw strong demand for its subscription services, too, despite recent price increases.  ## 2. Improving cash outlook  Shopify is still booking losses, which remains a key concern for investors. Gross profit margin declined to 48% of sales from 53% of sales a year ago.   Most of this drop was powered by its growing payments-processing service, though, which isn't as profitable as its core services. Adjusted operating loss was 2% of revenue, compared to a 4% profit in the previous quarter.   https://preview.redd.it/4x7sh8vltc2b1.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=403903892c1cb873eb54491771e7780a5d398530  Shopify's cash-flow trends are finally heading in the right direction. Management is calling for positive cash flow in each quarter of the new fiscal year, in fact, which would mark a big step back toward sustainable profitability. Operating expenses have now stabilized, chief financial officer Jeff Hoffmeister said in a conference call with investors. ""This directly reflects our focus ... to drive increased productivity and efficiency,"" Hoffmeister said.  ## 3. Customer satisfaction  Shopify's ability to grow into its premium valuation will depend on the platform's success at deepening its relationship with a growing base of customers. It will face intense competition on this score from companies aiming to win merchants over.   But there are signs of enduring competitive advantages in Shopify's e-commerce platform. The company's ""attach rate,"" which describes average merchant spending for a given level of sales volume, hit a record high in the first quarter. ""Merchants continue to buy more and more solutions from us,"" Hoffmeister said.  Cautious investors have many reasons to wait when considering Shopify stock, including its current net losses and the stock's price-to-sales ratio of 13. Microsoft shares are valued at 11 times revenue, for context.  Yet growth-focused investors should consider keeping Shopify on their watch lists -- if not in their portfolios -- right now. The company is positioned for a return to profitability soon, and the platform has a shot at meaningfully adding to its current market share of around 10% of e-commerce volumes in the core U.S. market. A cloudy economic outlook for the next few quarters shouldn't scare investors away from what appears to be a very positive long-term growth story for Shopify.";"6";"2023-05-27T07:54:23"

However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now.  I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices.  The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (**European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ** \- I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of **Norwegian dividend stocks** (Done)-Buy shares in **AMD** for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in **Alphabet** ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin **Tesla Corp** TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in **TSMC** TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to **bank account** I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time)  Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco **S&P 500 UCITS ETF** Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE **China UCITS ETF** FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE **India UCITS ETF** FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering **Apple** APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering **Microsoft** MSF, **Meta** FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering **Amazon** (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-**Berkshire Hathaway Class B** BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering **Palantir** PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered **Nvidia** (FOMO)-Considered **IBM** and **Intel** as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)  So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?  Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)";"0";"2023-07-17T15:28:09"
"Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/18s3rvu/magnificent_7_and_friends_contributed_75_of_sp/";"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing =  &#x200B:  The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023  [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9)  &#x200B:  The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions.  &#x200B:  It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post.  &#x200B:  The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%.  &#x200B:  The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%.  &#x200B:  Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%.  &#x200B:  Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said.  &#x200B:  That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote.  &#x200B:  Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found.  &#x200B:  Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July.  &#x200B:  The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said.  &#x200B:  The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering.  &#x200B:  SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown.  &#x200B:  Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78%  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%,  [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. AMZN, 0.16%,  Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%,  Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%,  Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%,  and Meta Platforms Inc.  META, 0.56%.  &#x200B:  See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024?  &#x200B:  Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind.  &#x200B:  The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.  &#x200B:  In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high:  &#x200B:  The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted.  &#x200B:  Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.";"11";"2023-12-27T16:52:27"
"Top Tech stocks to consider: Unlocking high potential investments for Tech enthusiasts";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/13vmjy6/top_tech_stocks_to_consider_unlocking_high/";"## A combination of recent performance, future opportunities, and attractive valuations makes these stocks compelling right now.  Despite the recent sell-off of tech stocks, this sector is still a favourite among investors -- and for good reason. Technology companies are fun and exciting to learn about and follow, and many of their products are consumer-facing favourites of many investors.  In the current higher-interest-rate environment, the price paid for stocks matters more than it has in recent history. With that in mind, there are some stocks that are still trading for reasonable or cheap valuations that present attractive buying opportunities right now. Let's take a look at three of those stocks to see what makes them great buys.  ## PayPal  For many years, the story of **PayPal** **(PYPL** **1.43%)** was one of expansion, with revenue growth averaging around 17% each quarter. More recently, management decided to prioritize increasing the activity of its existing customers. The recent results show that this may have been a wise decision.  One example is how much more valuable each account has become to PayPal's bottom line. In the first quarter of 2023, active accounts remained relatively stable year over year, while transactions per active account have increased by 13%. This is proof that the focus on driving higher activity levels on existing accounts is paying off.  ## DigitalOcean  The leaders in cloud infrastructure are household names. **Amazon** Web Services (AWS), **Alphabet**'s Google Cloud, and **Microsoft**'s Azure are the clear leaders in the space. However, smaller upstart **DigitalOcean** (**DOCN** **4.99%)** is not only holding its own, but it's also growing faster than its tech giant competitors.   DigitalOcean caters to small and medium-sized businesses by offering affordable and transparent pricing as well as substantial customer support. This strategy has been paying off. In Q1 2023, DigitalOcean grew its revenue by 30% year over year, outpacing its competition. For comparison, AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure increased by 16%, 28%, and 27%, respectively.  DigitalOcean is also growing its largest customers even more rapidly than its revenue. Customers that spend more than $50 per month, called ""builders and scalers,"" increased by 43% year over year. These customers now represent 86% of total revenue. This is an important metric to keep an eye on as it is an indicator of how DigitalOcean is able to continue to serve its customers as they grow and scale.  The company has only been on the public markets for a few years, but it's currently trading for valuation multiples below its historical average and not far from its all-time lows.  ## Endava  **Endava** (**DAVA** **2.53%)** may not be a household name for investors, but it should be. This IT consulting company has been putting up impressive numbers despite the fact that its stock is down 34% year to date and down 70% from its late 2021 high.  Third-quarter 2023 results, which represent the quarter ending in March, were impressive with revenue and earnings per share increasing by 20% year over year. Endava is also consistently cash flow positive, and it generated a 10% free cash flow margin for the quarter.   Endava has been growing its roster of large customers impressively. The number of clients spending more than 1 million British pounds ($1.24 million) in revenue reached 155 in Q3, an increase of 31% year over year. The overall customer base is also becoming more diversified. Endava's top-10 clients represented 33% of total revenue in Q3, down from 35% in the year-ago quarter.  The stock took a hit after earnings, mostly due to the fact that the company lowered its fiscal 2023 guidance. However, management thinks that slowing revenue from the private equity part of its customer base is a temporary pause due to the fallout relating to the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March.  Endava trades for three times sales and 25 times earnings, both of which are near all-time lows. With strong results even in the face of some important customers' short-term challenges, the current valuation is compelling for this quickly growing business.";"0";"2023-05-30T12:29:38"
"Unity Software Analysis_2 Comparison";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/199jpwd/unity_software_analysis_2_comparison/";"   [ Product scores ](https://preview.redd.it/yqzpkdet75dc1.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9c43ec0ed972d0a8aa714cb8eec0de16cb7b999)  **Product**  To get a clearer picture of Unity's product market position, I search some software scores from G2 to make a comparison. This kind of data is not easy to find and I found the sample size is small, so maybe this comparison has bias.   I compared some 3D content creation software with Unity, and Unity ranks 3rd in Total Score and first in Star Rating, similar to Unreal and lower than Blender. From the user scale, Unity, Blender, and 3ds Max are used by more users, and Unity has the largest user feedback compared with other software. I think Unity's software quality and useful functions are similar to main create software, like Blender and Unreal, and Unity has a large user scale as its success in mobile game developers. Currently, mobile device sales are slowing down, and mobile games still have the highest growth in the video game industry, I think Unity has a good foundation and needs to do more to attract developers for the next success. (I attached the functions score for reference.)  &#x200B:  [ Product functions ](https://preview.redd.it/5lb0c2nw75dc1.png?width=1599&format=png&auto=webp&s=17ea374d2c17bfbb333cc547fd93b629384d4646)  Moving to financial, most of Unity's competitors are not listed on the public market, so it's hard to find financial data to make a comparison. Because Unity's main business is 2D&3D content creation software and ad platform for apps, so I chose some listed companies with similar businesses to compare their financial data. The competitors I selected are Adobe, AppLovin, and Autodesk.  &#x200B:  [ Revenue and EPS Growth ](https://preview.redd.it/7u61vaxv75dc1.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=43d92e1fbbc3d1fc7c7407f6e40e308230bba34c)  **Growth**  Unity performed well in growth compared with its competitors, revenue growth is much higher than Adobe and Autodesk, and net profit is negative but continuing to improve. The App ad platform competitor AppLovin's growth is better than Unity's, but its net profit growth has been unstable and stuck.   I think Unity's growth is not very impressive as its financially meaningless expansion on game service did not contribute to the growth and made Unity still in negative profit. Create software and ad platforms was a good combination that could generate cash flow to support growth. I look forward to seeing a better combination of those two sectors after their reorganization. I believe this is beneficial for Unity's valuation.  &#x200B:  [ Margins ](https://preview.redd.it/n2c0dprz75dc1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=a50eaf1637fd37b4d6b81184e57a24d3ff6b8ba4)  **Profitability**  Unity has the worst margins compared with its competitors. Create software has higher margins than ad platforms, but needs high-quality users with spending power and willingness. Unity's more than half of revenue comes from ad services, so its gross margin is similar to AppLovin and much lower than Autodesk and Adobe. As CAD software and productivity software providers, Adobe and Autodesk have more solid quality customers than Unity, and most users of Unity software do not spend on its platform. Unity needs to focus on the core create functions, not un-profitable plug tools, and keep them advanced, which can help improve its value for big clients who may spend more on the platform. Second, Unity must generate more cash flow from the ad platform, I think this is an achievable goal for Unity.  Considering Unity's core product portfolio, I still believe Unity has more growth and profitability potential than AppLovin in the future.  &#x200B:  [ Cash conversion cycle ](https://preview.redd.it/2s1hjgo185dc1.png?width=931&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cfa07b2943cfdf18c2785a4240b65b4de49a205)  **Turnover**  I think all four companies are good at cash management. They all have negative cash conversion cycles with stable operating cash flow generation. From the data, I believe Unity has more advantages in the game app ad industry as it has a much negative number of cash conversions. This is impressive and gives Unity enough money to run its business and can use investors' money to invest in expansion. Of course, if this investment has good returns.  &#x200B:  [ Investment returns and cost ](https://preview.redd.it/dfp2mmh385dc1.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=9679a1bc16b6d4d801451839d0c7f809d1f9cd91)  **Return**  Unity is the riskiest compared to its competitors as it has the highest WACC and still has high losses. AppLovin is not good too as all returns do not exceed its WACC, which means AppLovin still does not generate enough margins to cover its investment cost. Considering there is a possibility of the high-interest period persisting longer, I think it is time for Unity to try hard to realize a better combination of growth and profitability. Maybe the current failure of strategy and management change provides an opportunity for Unity to re-focus on core value, and invest in AR, AIGC, and ad platforms that can meet customers' demand and create more value for them.  &#x200B:  [ Capital structure and insolvency risk ](https://preview.redd.it/15y8a0y585dc1.png?width=969&format=png&auto=webp&s=988ea7e7708100f312ea9afdbe4d56423b006649)  **Capital Structure**  Unity may have not as much insolvency risk as it looks like. Unity has a lower financial leverage compared with AppLovin and Autodesk and the highest quick ratio. I think Unity's capital structure is still solid because of its strong cash position, no interest burden, high cash conversion cycle, and positive free cash flow achieved.  &#x200B:  [ Valuation multiples ](https://preview.redd.it/fv786om785dc1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=67965f3f093a2f287dcc576da82e5ae0ff52c999)  **Valuation**  Because Unity still does not have profit, I selected EV/Revenue and PB ratio for comparison. After the price crashed, Unity's current valuation is more reasonable compared with its history, and better than its competitors. Unity's multiple is still much higher than the software industry medium line. From the data shown, I think Unity's current price is fair compared with peers with many growth catalysts this year.   &#x200B:  **Conclusion**  I believe Unity is not a great software investment target because it has low-quality and unstable customers compared with other software companies like Adobe, Salesforce, and Microsoft. But if I want to choose a software company in the gaming sector to carry the video game growth opportunities, I think Unity is a special one with its combined product portfolio, which can create value for game developers and potentially compete with software providers in other industries, like Autodesk. Unity faces stronger competition in the future, but it has a high advantage foundation and many catalysts like re-organization, product re-focus, expense cutting, and positive free cash flow this year. I think it is an opportunity at the current price to consider.";"3";"2024-01-18T07:33:19"
"Last week's market performance and economic news review";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1ae38hv/last_weeks_market_performance_and_economic_news/";"Last week was another solid week for the global stock markets, to say the least. However, this time out, it were the European indices that outperformed. US benchmarks all posted green weeks, with the Dow up ever so slightly and the Nasdaq and S&P500 up closer to 0.5% after posting new all-time highs halfway through the week.  Meanwhile, the major European indices posted incredible gains of multiple percentages, which were helped by great results from European heavyweights ASML and LVMH, jumping over 10% on their blowout earnings. As a result, the Euro Stoxx 50 gained over 3% and the Euro Stoxx 600 closer to 2.5%. However, the real European standout was once again the Dutch AEX, which gained over 4%, driven by the performance of ASML, which has a significant 15% weight in the index.  All in all, it is quite a solid performance, especially considering the headwinds global economies and companies continue to face. Whenever you think there is no more upside, the market finds a reason to put down new all-time highs. It just once more proves that the Mr. market is irrational and, above all, completely unpredictable.  Yet, we will add that our view of the markets remains the same. We continue to view current optimism as overdone and expect the markets to show some volatile reactions on important quarterly results and economic data throughout the remainder of Q1 and into Q2. The broader upside is most likely limited.  At the same time, though, there is room for optimism as economic data from last week points in the right direction, making the likelihood for a 25 bps rate cut as early as May somewhat more likely.  [The Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures price index for December](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/26/pce-inflation-december-2023-.html), which is the most crucial inflation indicator for the Federal Reserve, increased by 0.2% month over month and 2.9% YoY, which is roughly in line with projections from Dow Jones analysts.  The 12-month rate is the lowest since March 2021, down from 3.2% in November. So, what does this mean for the Fed and interest rates?  Well, this report confirms that while inflation is certainly sticky and remains elevated, it is trending down progressively and should indicate to the Fed that it can start lowering rates later this year. However, it is no reason to become more bullish than we already were, and a first interest rate cut in June still seems like the most viable option in our eyes.  However, there is room for more positivity, as, on Thursday, a report showed that the U.S. economy grew much faster than expected in the final months of 2023, with [GPD growing by 3.3%](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/gdp-q4-2023-the-us-economy-grew-at-a-3point3percent-pace-in-the-fourth-quarter.html) in Q4. This compared favorably to a Wall Street estimate for just 2% growth and is no massive slowdown from the 4.9% reported in Q3.  This highlights that even in the face of high-interest rates, the U.S. economy continues to fire on all cylinders. Meanwhile, inflation is trending down strongly, with the PCE price index rising 2.7%, down from 5.9% a year ago, while the core figure posted a 3.2% increase annually, compared with 5.1% one year ago.  While the markets showed little response to these numbers due to the data being backward-looking and the market being a forward-looking machine, this could bode well for the Fed’s commitment to lower rates. According to the CME Group, the Fed will almost certainly keep rates flat in both the January 31st meeting and the March 20 meeting.  However, the market does still price in a high likelihood for the Fed to announce the first rate cut in May, which might still be slightly too optimistic, though not impossible, looking at these December numbers, assuming inflation data in upcoming months shows solid progress.  Even more positive news for the Fed was the surprising weakness in the labor market, with initial jobless claims data for the week ending Jan. 20 coming in surprisingly high. Initial jobless claims totaled 214,000, up by 25,000 from the prior week and above the Dow Jones estimate of 199,000. For a while now, the Fed has been looking for some softening in the labor market, and while this single week is no real solid indication, this will be what officials are looking for.  Positively, with regard to the tight labor market, tech layoffs ballooned so far in January, with over 23,500 employees laid off from 85 different technology companies, which is massive, [as reported by CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/26/tech-layoffs-jump-in-january-as-alphabet-meta-microsoft-reach-high.html). That is the highest number since March 2023.  Meanwhile, unsurprisingly, the European Central Bank held rates steady on Wednesday and gave little insight or indication of future rate cuts. It said that recent data had broadly confirmed its previous inflation outlook and that a declining trend in underlying inflation had continued. Like the Federal Reserve, the ECB indicated that its decision-making will be data-driven, fixating on economic data.  As of Thursday morning, markets were pricing in a 62% probability of a rate cut in April, according to LSEG data.  On another positive note, [Citi analysts expect](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/22/no-economic-collapse-top-citi-strategist-says-healthier-economic-growth-is-coming.html) economic growth to accelerate next year and to return to healthy levels relatively quickly. According to Citi analysts, the U.S. should be able to avoid an economic collapse.  Furthermore, [Citi also believes](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4056795-citi-indicated-that-the-sp-500-is-not-as-expensive-as-it-appears) the S&P500 is not as expensive as it seems and blames the rather high valuation of 22x trailing earnings on the magnificent 7, painting a misleading picture. According to its equal-weight calculations, the index is realistically trading closer to 19x earnings, which is not as concerning.  Yes, this sounds a bit like they are looking for the bright spots to stay optimistic, creating their own valuations, but they also make a fair point. While technology and the largest S&P500 stocks are trading at very demanding valuations, most of the companies in the S&P500 aren’t all that expensive compared to historical multiples.";"2";"2024-01-29T20:04:17"
"Nintendo Analysis_1";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/193rqsm/nintendo_analysis_1/";"&#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/rixesrj5cqbc1.png?width=1316&format=png&auto=webp&s=00eb69752b36bd375d12f0943cf1c23bfb5895da  **Revenue & Profit Growth**   The revenue growth of Nintendo is highly volatile depending on the new consoles and titles it released.   Nintendo has two big revenue growth records in the past 23 years. The first was in 2007, Nintendo achieved big sales in Wii and NDS Lite with their software worldwide after it released them in 2006. Wii was a success in the 7th console competition as it attracted more people to convert to players and expanded the whole game market, especially Wii has a high-profit margin compared with Xbox360 and PS3. But after that, Nintendo lost the whole next-generation competition. Nintendo's revenue and profit declined from 2010 to 2017, because the sales were full for Wii and NDS, and the successor Wii U failed in competition with PlayStation 4. Nintendo was too conservative in products, and its share price crashed in those years.   Nintendo released its new console Switch in 2017 and achieved big success in the market. Nintendo has had the highest revenue and profit growth in the past, but again, the growth only persists for 4 years, and the new OLED Switch cannot inject much fuel for Nintendo compared with PS5. Although the last half-year financial report showed Switch and its software still have growth in its seventh year, especially in software, benefitting the Zelda successor release and the hit Super Mario Movie, I think it's time to update the new console and open the next growth cycle.   The other good thing is Nintendo's revenue and profit growth are high   a positive relationship, which means its revenue growth can drive profit.   From the growth data, we know we can invest in Nintendo when it releases new console and titles, but we don't know if the new console will succeed in the market. I hope Nintendo can bring us new fun in the future.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/iyd2uzh6cqbc1.png?width=1335&format=png&auto=webp&s=083557c191b151286b8465236e28a7d0a23cb136     **Revenue Quality**   Nintendo's cash conversion rate is bad because most time the rate of operating cash flow to net income is below 1. And this ratio has been around 0.5 in the last 2 years. The reasons are an increase in inventory and profit, and gains in equity investment and foreign exchange. I know some of them are not regular things, but this conversion rate is not good for me.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/s31iitb7cqbc1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=66711e3d52cd62e062057e4cda16531fdf512508     **Margins**   Nintendo's profit profit-earning ability enhanced after Switch was released in 2017. Its gross margin climbed to 55% and its operating margin jumped to 31% in 2023, much higher than the average of the past 20 years.   I think Nintendo's margin is volatile too, not like Bandai's stable expansion, its margins are high related to new consoles and titles released. I don't like much volatile margin for a company, which means its advantage is thin and weak.   Nintendo finds a way to compete with Sony and Xbox. Not just the console's functionalities, it is the integration of console, IP, and games, and keep expanding user scale to enter their IP world. Of course, Nintendo has seen the fuel in the console and game sales through its IP expansion strategy.   I still notice the total tiles sold in the Switch platform has declined from last year, even though it is a high number compared with years before COVID-19. Nintendo must think about new drivers for the next generation competition, although they want to break the rules of console life. I believe the Switch will perform well in its eighth year as a scale console sold and keep releasing new titles in 2024. I would like to see some news about the new console from Nintendo this year, not only from the player but also the investor.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/6wcikbt9cqbc1.png?width=1513&format=png&auto=webp&s=48dee8237cfc1abc1e7e636607ddbd6cdfabcf74     **Turnover**   Nintendo has a good cash turnover rate which expresses its dominant role in game title issuing before 2010. But things changed after Sony and Microsoft entered this sector. Nintendo's cash and inventory turnover has declined in recent years, which is the second-highest level in its history. I think this is some affected by capex increase recently. Although this number is good for game developers, I would like to see more efficiency in cash use.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/gf13xljacqbc1.png?width=1425&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a045fe9173607b53f7f5391c8bd64a6a8a309e5  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/c4cisycjcqbc1.png?width=1568&format=png&auto=webp&s=3555fb13dbeb1106d6ce3d08440ec3bb7277383c     **Asset & Capital Structure**   After Nintendo's domination breakdown by Sony and Xbox, Nintendo's AR increased in the last ten years but declined recently, and inventory climbed in the Covid period, similar to peers.   I think Nintendo's operating and fixed assets are stable with business and PPE will increase in the following years as the new R&D headquarters develops.   As a Japanese company, Nintendo has very low financial leverage with strong solvency.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/1jl6a9lbcqbc1.png?width=1571&format=png&auto=webp&s=2853b201227611cac98ad1d7cce8eb11bd99a794  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/cj6ubbjhcqbc1.png?width=1375&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7b30b9c0e023183b0fb5ca3ed4e78c6ed192031     **Returns & Valuation**   Nintendo has had good investment returns in the past as most time its ROIC exceeds its WACC. Equity return is not outstanding, most times below 12%, but moved better in recent years, I think it's benefitted the Switch sale and IP expansion.   Nintendo's return data is express cycle character too and decline slowly in the past 2 years. This is another signal of the need to refresh its product portfolio.   Nintendo's valuation is good as its profit increased around 6x and the price has just increased 1.8x in the last seven years. I think Nintendo's price is fair, but maybe expensive after its price soared after the second-quarter results were released.  &#x200B:  **Conclusion**   Nintendo is a great company with high innovation ability, evergreen IP, and an expanded client base. However, its financial result is highly volatile and relies on its console and title release. This makes Nintendo like a cycle stock. The Switch has given Nintendo the confidence to say no to the console life rule in this sector, and it achieved another strong sales half year. This is impressive but I am still concerned about some data, like declined equity returns and cash turnover, and its low cash conversion.   As 2024 is the eighth year of Switch and many rumors about the Switch2 release plan, I think Nintendo has a high probability of opening a new growth tunnel if it new console is released this year. Maybe this is the right timing to build some positions and wait for that, compared to Wii, Switch's long life and good performance have decline many investment risks.";"3";"2024-01-11T04:26:07"
"An Open Letter to the CEO and directors of Cloudflare";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/159c3ez/an_open_letter_to_the_ceo_and_directors_of/";"   To Mr. Matthew Prince, and Directors of Cloudflare,  My name is Ming Wong, and I am the CEO of Zetalon Ltd., a company that has been a committed investor and free user of Cloudflare's services. I am penning this open letter to express my concerns and provide suggestions that, I believe, could contribute to the financial performance and longevity of Cloudflare.  Despite the company's remarkable growth in customer base and service offerings since its initial public offering in 2019, the financial reports from 2019 to the present indicate a continuous operation at a loss, with a reported loss of $190.1M in 2022. This persistent inability to turn a profit raises serious concerns about the company's long-term sustainability and its value creation for shareholders.  I understand that Cloudflare's strategy has been to build customer loyalty and support small websites to grow into large, paid websites. This is a commendable approach, and it has indeed resulted in a significant increase in Cloudflare's customer base. However, it is also clear that this strategy has not been successful in turning the company's impressive growth into profitability.  Cloudflare's growth and market presence are indeed impressive. The company boasts over 4 million customers, including 17% of Fortune 500 companies. It generated $431.06 million in revenue in 2020, a 5.08x increase since 2016. There are 7.59 million active websites using Cloudflare, and the company has 119,206 paying customers. These paying customers produced 88.84% of the revenue, indicating a significant reliance on a relatively small portion of the user base.  Despite this impressive market share, Cloudflare has fewer high-traffic websites compared to competitors like Akamai, Amazon CloudFront, and Fastly. This is a clear indication that the company's current strategy is not fully capitalizing on its potential.  Importantly, Cloudflare provides its services at a more affordable rate than many of its competitors, including BelugaCDN, Amazon Web Services, Stack Path, Microsoft Azure, and Google. This competitive pricing gives Cloudflare an edge in attracting customers, particularly small and medium enterprises looking for cost-effective solutions. While this strategy contributes to Cloudflare's expansive customer base, it further underlines the necessity of increasing revenue streams beyond just customer subscriptions.  However, the current financial performance poses potential risks to the shareholders. Continuous operation at a loss can diminish shareholder value over time, which could eventually lead to shareholder dissatisfaction and the potential for capital flight. Shareholder value should not be an afterthought: rather, it is a primary goal that aligns with the company's growth and success.  To address this and enhance profitability, I propose a strategic shift in Cloudflare's approach to its free services. Here are the specific changes I propose:  Limit Free Plan Features: Disallow features like Async JavaScript Loading with Rocket Loader and Multi-User Administrative Access and Read-only User Access in the free plan. Also, limit the number of free custom hostnames from 100 to 50. These changes will encourage multi-employee companies to upgrade to a paid plan.  Introduce Ads on the ""Checking your browser before accessing"" Page: By forcing this page to be shown on all free websites, it can serve as an effective platform for displaying ads, providing an additional revenue stream. This change could also serve as a stepping stone for Cloudflare to develop its own ad network, further diversifying its revenue streams.  Introduce a $20 per Year Plan: Replace the current free plan with a $20 per year plan. This nominal fee is affordable for most users and can generate significant revenue given Cloudflare's large user base.  Although these changes may entail risks such as potential customer dissatisfaction and a possible initial decrease in the user base, it is important to emphasize the long-term benefits. Implementing these changes could not only result in increased revenue but also lead to a diversified business model less reliant on customer subscriptions alone. This diversification could reduce risk in the long term and lead to a more robust, resilient business. Moreover, the profitability from these strategic shifts could significantly increase shareholder value over time, securing the company's longevity and growth prospects.  Here are some rough estimates:  If 25% of the 7.48 million free websites move to the $20 per year plan, that's 1.87 million websites. At $20 per website per year, the potential revenue increase would be $37.4 million per year.  Assuming 25% of websites stop using Cloudflare, the remaining free plan users would be 3.24 million websites. Assuming the average daily traffic of the websites is 100, that's 324 million page views per day. Over a year, that's approximately 118.26 billion page views. With a $3 CPM, the average CPM of Google Display Network ads, the potential ad revenue would be approximately $354.780 million per year.  So, the total potential revenue increase from both the $20 per year plan and the ads would be approximately $392.18 million per year. This revenue increase not only covers the $193.4 million loss reported in 2022 but also potentially results in a significant profit.  I understand and appreciate the reasoning behind Cloudflare's commitment to a free service, and I am cognizant of the factors that make it such an invaluable asset. I'd like to address each of these points:  Data: Cloudflare's ability to gather a wide array of data from its free service users, thereby enhancing protection for paid users, is indeed commendable. My proposition for limiting features on the free plan and the introduction of a $20 per year plan should not compromise this ability. A lower-tiered paid plan may even encourage more users to sign up, potentially offering a larger data set.  Customer Referrals: I recognize that customer referrals, particularly from satisfied users of the free service, play a pivotal role in attracting larger customers. I believe that a $20 per year plan would continue to offer tremendous value, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction and continuing to drive referrals.  Employee Referrals: I acknowledge the importance of the free plan in attracting potential employees. I propose that, with careful communication and strategic rollout, the changes will be accepted and will continue to attract top talent to Cloudflare.  QA: Offering new features to free customers for testing is indeed a unique and valuable approach. The changes I propose should not interfere with this. On the contrary, a more diverse range of customers due to a $20 plan may provide even more varied feedback and testing.  Bandwidth Chicken & Egg: I understand the role of free customers in achieving the scale necessary for competitive pricing and regional peering. By introducing a reasonably priced $20 per year plan, I believe that we can maintain, if not increase, the diversity and scale of our customer base.  Looking ahead, I believe that Cloudflare holds substantial growth opportunities, which, if tapped into strategically, could enhance long-term benefits for both the company and its shareholders. Specifically, I would like to highlight three potential areas of expansion:  Ad Networks: By introducing ads on the ""Checking your browser before accessing"" page, Cloudflare could diversify its revenue streams and lay the foundation for establishing its own ad network. Ad networks have been profitable ventures for many tech companies, and with Cloudflare's broad user base, there is significant potential for high returns.  Web Hosting Services: Cloudflare's existing infrastructure and network capacity make it an ideal candidate to offer web hosting services. This could attract a new customer segment that's looking for a one-stop-shop for their website needs, generating additional revenue while enhancing the company's value proposition.  Virtual Private Servers (VPS): The growing trend towards remote work and online businesses increases the demand for reliable and affordable VPS. By offering VPS services, Cloudflare could capitalize on this trend and further strengthen its market position.  By expanding into these areas, Cloudflare would not only diversify its offerings but also create synergies with its existing services. For instance, customers using Cloudflare's web hosting or VPS services could be more likely to use other Cloudflare services, creating a more integrated and stickier customer base.  Moreover, these new revenue streams could greatly enhance the long-term financial performance of the company. While the initial investment might be substantial, the potential for increased and diversified revenue could outweigh the costs in the long term, driving profitability, and thereby enhancing shareholder value.  While I believe that the changes, I propose carry significant potential for profit and growth, I am aware that they also present certain risks. Therefore, I find it essential to acknowledge and consider these risks in your decision-making process.  Customer Backlash: Changes to the free plan could lead to a backlash from current free users. However, it's important to note that even with these changes, Cloudflare's services are still very competitively priced. Therefore, despite changes to the free plan, Cloudflare will continue to provide excellent value for its users. Nevertheless, careful communication about these changes and potentially introducing transitional measures could help manage this risk effectively.  Competitive Dynamics: A change in Cloudflare's pricing structure could potentially alter competitive dynamics in the market, possibly inciting competitive responses from other CDN and cloud service providers.  Ad Network Viability: While the potential revenue from ads is significant, building an ad network also involves challenges. Besides the technical challenges, it may also take time to attract advertisers and achieve profitable scale.  Diversification Risks: While diversifying into web hosting services and VPS may seem attractive, it's important to consider that Cloudflare would be competing in a new market with its own competitive dynamics and established players. Moreover, the investment required to establish a presence in these markets could be substantial.  As with any strategic decisions, it's crucial to balance the potential rewards with the inherent risks. While the strategies I propose carry risks, I believe that with careful planning and execution, these risks can be effectively managed. Moreover, the potential long-term benefits in terms of revenue growth, profitability, and shareholder value are significant.  I am confident in Cloudflare's potential for growth and profitability. However, it is crucial that the management team takes decisive action to address the current profitability issues. The proposed strategies are not just about improving the financial performance of the company, but also about fulfilling the company's responsibilities to its shareholders.  Thank you for taking the time to consider my concerns and proposals. I firmly believe that these strategic shifts would significantly enhance Cloudflare's profitability and shareholder value. I urge the board to conduct a thorough review of the proposed strategies and consider implementing them for the long-term success of the company.  I look forward to your response and to seeing Cloudflare seize these growth opportunities, ensuring a prosperous future for all stakeholders.  Best regards,  Ming Wong  CEO, Zetalon Ltd.
