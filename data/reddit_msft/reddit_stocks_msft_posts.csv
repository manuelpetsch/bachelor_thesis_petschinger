"Microsoft to appeal IRS request for nearly $29 billion in back taxes";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/175q2pb/microsoft_to_appeal_irs_request_for_nearly_29/";"Microsoft plans to contest a US Internal Revenue Service request for an additional $28.9 billion in back taxes for the years 2004 to 2013, the company said in a securities filing Wednesday.  The demand is the result of a yearslong audit by the IRS into Microsoft’s past accounting practices. In particular, the agency took issue with how the company “allocated profits … among countries and jurisdictions,” Microsoft said in the filing.  “The IRS says Microsoft owes an additional $28.9 billion in tax for 2004 to 2013, plus penalties and interest,” the company said. It noted that the IRS’s determination is not final and does not include up to $10 billion in taxes Microsoft paid under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that could reduce its final bill.  The company said it plans to appeal the IRS request, a process that will likely take several years.   https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/11/tech/microsoft-irs-back-taxes/index.html  https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000119312523254151/d530324d8k.htm";"1249";"2023-10-11T23:53:36"

Here’s how the company did in comparison with the consensus from LSEG:   Earnings per share: $2.94 vs. $2.82 expected  Revenue: $61.86 vs. $60.80 billion expected  Microsoft’s total revenue grew 17% year over year in the quarter, which ended on March 31, according to a statement.  During the quarter, Microsoft introduced Surface PCs with a key for quickly accessing the Copilot chatbot. The company started selling access to the Copilot for small businesses with Microsoft 365 productivity software subscriptions and hired Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of artificial intelligence lab DeepMind, to run a new Microsoft AI group. Suleyman had been co-founder and CEO of startup Inflection, and many of its employees also joined Microsoft.  “We have been operating with speed and intensity and this infusion of new talent will enable us to accelerate our pace yet again,” CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a memo about the Inflection deal, which was reportedly worth $650 million.  This marks the first full quarter for sales of the Copilot add-on for commercial Microsoft 365 customers.

The products we built are used by millions of people around the world. Until now, the company we work for and cherish has never been in a stronger position.  The process through which you terminated Sam Altman and removed Greg Brockman from the board has jeopardized all of this work and undermined our mission and company. Your conduct has made it clear you did not have the competence to oversee OpenAI.  When we all unexpectedly learned of your decision, the leadership team of OpenAI acted swiftly to stabilize the company. They carefully listened to your concerns and tried to cooperate with you on all grounds. Despite many requests for specific facts for your allegations, you have never provided any written evidence. They also increasingly realized you were not capable of carrying out your duties, and were negotiating in bad faith.  The leadership team suggested that the most stabilizing path forward - the one that would best serve our mission, company, stakeholders, employees and the public - would be for you to resign and put in place a qualified board that could lead the company forward in stability.  Leadership worked with you around the clock to find a mutually agreeable outcome. Yet within two days of your initial decision, you again replaced interim CEO Mira Murati against the best interests of the company. You also informed the leadership team that allowing the company to be destroyed “would be consistent with the mission.”  Your actions have made it obvious that you are incapable of overseeing OpenAI. We are unable to work for or with people that lack competence, judgement and care for our mission and employees. We, the undersigned, may choose to resign from OpenAI and join the newly announced Microsoft subsidiary run by Sam Altman and Greg Brockman.

"Microsoft Reportedly Tried to Sell Bing to Apple in 2020";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16v5j80/microsoft_reportedly_tried_to_sell_bing_to_apple/";"Microsoft executives tried to sell the company’s Bing search engine to Apple around 2020, pitching the deal as a way for the iPhone maker to replace Google as the default search engine in Apple’s Safari browser, Bloomberg reported. The talks never reached an advanced stage, according to the report.  The revelation comes as the U.S. Department of Justice seeks to prove to a federal judge that Google violated antitrust laws by abusing its dominance over the search market. Google’s deal with Apple to share ad revenue in exchange for default status in Safari, and whether that agreement made it impossible for challengers like Bing to compete, have been a key part of the ongoing antitrust trial in Washington. Microsoft’s alleged sale effort appears to bolster the government’s contention that Google locked up the market to the point where its top competitor was willing to throw in the towel. It also shows that Apple, the world’s most valuable company, preferred to stick with the Google deal than pick a costly battle in search.

Net income, at $21.87 billion, or $2.93 per share, increased from $16.43 billion, or $2.20 per share.  The company’s Intelligent Cloud segment produced $25.88 billion in revenue, up 20% and above the $25.29 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The grouping contains Azure cloud infrastructure, SQL Server, Windows Server, Nuance, GitHub and enterprise services.  Within that segment, revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 30%. Analysts polled by CNBC had expected 27.7% growth, and the StreetAccount consensus was 27.5%. The metric for the previous quarter was 29%.  Revenue from the Productivity and Business Processes unit including Office productivity software, LinkedIn and Dynamics totaled $19.25 billion.

"Microsoft Is Looking To Acquire Nintendo “At Some Point”, Mario Maker’s Future “Exists Off Of Its Hardware”";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16mtamt/microsoft_is_looking_to_acquire_nintendo_at_some/";"https://twistedvoxel.com/microsoft-looking-to-acquire-nintendo-future-exists-off-of-its-hw/  Microsoft is looking to acquire Nintendo “at some point”, and it believes that the Mario maker’s future “exists off of its own hardware”. Through a flurry of leaked documents involved in the court case between the FTC and Microsoft, it has been revealed that the software giant has been looking to acquire Nintendo since the year 2020. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer believes that the acquisition of Nintendo by Microsoft would be a “career moment” for him, and he believes it would be a good move for both companies.  In his email to Microsoft’s Executive Vice President and Commercial Chief Marketing Officer, Takeshi Numoto, and Chief Marketing Officer, Chris Capossela, Spencer stated that it’s just taking a long time for Nintendo to see that its future “exists off of their own hardware”, but he is firm in his belief that the acquisition will happen “at some point”, and that Nintendo will eventually see things the way Microsoft does. Nintendo has yet to comment on the leaked statement from Phil Spencer.  Addressing Numoto, Spencer stated that he totally agreed that Nintendo is the prime asset for Microsoft in the Gaming business, and that, today, Gaming is the company’s most likely path to consumer relevance. He mentioned that he has had numerous conversations with the LT of Nintendo about tighter collaboration and felt that if any US company would have a chance with Nintendo, Microsoft would probably be in the best position. According to him, the unfortunate (or fortunate for Nintendo) situation is that the Mario maker is “sitting on a big pile of cash”. He said that Nintendo has a Board of Directors (BoD) that, until recently, have not pushed for further increases in market growth or stock appreciation. He clarified that he said “until recently”, as Microsoft’s former BoD member, ValueAct, has been heavily acquiring shares of Nintendo.";"817";"2023-09-19T16:58:35"
"Meta, Microsoft and Amazon team up on maps project to crack Apple-Google duopoly";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15abmox/meta_microsoft_and_amazon_team_up_on_maps_project/";"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/meta-microsoft-amazon-join-overture-maps-to-vie-with-apple-google.html  Google and Apple dominate the market for online maps, charging mobile app developers for access to their mapping services. The other mega-cap tech companies are joining together to help create another option. A group formed by Meta, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, along with TomTom, is releasing data that could enable companies to build their own maps, without having to rely on Google or Apple. The Overture Maps Foundation, which was established late last year, captured 59 million “points of interest,” such as restaurants, landmarks, streets and regional borders. The data has been cleaned and formatted so it can be used for free as the base layer for a new map application.  Meta and Microsoft collected and donated the data to Overture, according to Marc Prioleau, executive director of the OMF. Data on places is often difficult to collect and license, and building map data requires lots of time and staff to gather and clean it, he told CNBC in an interview. “We have some companies that, if they wanted to invest to build the map data, they could,” Prioleau said. Rather than spending that kind of money, he said, companies were asking, “Can we just get collaboration around the open base map?” Overture is aiming to establish a baseline for maps data so that companies can use it to build and operate their own maps.  For many companies, Google’s and Apple’s maps aren’t ideal, because they don’t provide access to the underlying data. Instead, those companies allow app makers to use their maps as a service and, in many cases, charge each time the underlying map is accessed. For example, app makers pay per thousand Google Maps lookups through an application programming interface (API). Apple allows access to Apple Maps for free for native app developers, but web app developers need to pay. “That works for a lot of people, but not for others,” Prioleau said. Overture is only offering the underlying map data, leaving it up to companies to build their own software on top of it.";"795";"2023-07-26T19:13:04"

Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month, according to a regulatory disclosure Thursday.      The transactions on the filing, marked with ""SP"" for the spouse, indicate that Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options purchased on May 24, 2022, with a listed expiration date of June 16.      The Apple options had a strike price of $80, and the Microsoft options had a strike price of $180. On Friday, those shares closed at $186.68 and $335.02, respectively, totaling about $933,000 and $1.7 million.      Since the options were purchased last May, Apple shares have gained 33%, and Microsoft has climbed 29%. The upside from the strike price is even higher, at 131% and 83%, respectively.      First highlighted by Quiver Quantitative and Unusual Whales, the disclosure comes after Congress failed to make progress on new legislation around lawmakers and their relatives trading stocks.      Earlier this year, Insider and several other news organizations identified 78 members of Congress who didn't properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act.      Congress passed the law a decade ago to combat insider trading and conflicts of interest. But many lawmakers have not fully complied with reporting requirements, leading to calls for a complete ban on trading individual stocks among members of Congress.      Legislation on such a ban advanced last year, but the bill ultimately died.      Meanwhile, Paul Pelosi has faced backlash over stock trades that seem to coincide with legislation in the technology sector.      For example, in July 2021, he pocketed a $4.8 million gain in a Alphabet stock trade the week before the House Judiciary Committee advanced bipartisan antitrust bills targeting Google, Apple, and Amazon.      However, Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly that her financier husband's trades have nothing to do with her political knowledge.      OpenSecrets estimated that Pelosi has a net worth of $114.6 million.";"2432";"2023-06-27T11:34:17"

Microsoft's shares rose 2.1% to a new all-time high of $377.44, surpassing the previous record of $376.17.      Altman's move to Microsoft came after he was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup, leading to a 1.7% decline in Microsoft's shares on the previous Friday. Microsoft is the largest stakeholder in OpenAI, with a $13 billion investment in the AI firm.      Greg Brockman, co-founder of OpenAI who left after Altman's removal, is also set to join Microsoft. The hiring of Altman and Brockman follows days of speculation about Altman's potential return to the company after his abrupt firing from OpenAI.      Microsoft's shares have risen approximately 56% for the year, making it one of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks that have significantly contributed to the market's overall returns in 2023. Analysts, including Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities, reiterated a positive outlook for Microsoft, with Ives maintaining a $425 price target for the stock. The addition of Altman and Brockman is seen as strengthening Microsoft's position in the field of AI.   ";"512";"2023-11-21T11:34:05"
"Microsoft earnings are out – here are the numbers";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/159jfo6/microsoft_earnings_are_out_here_are_the_numbers/";"Microsoft reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.  Here are the key numbers to follow:  Earnings: $2.69 a share. That may not compare with the $2.55 cents per share expected by Refinitiv.  Revenue:  $56.19 billion. That may not compare with the $55.47 billion expected by Refinitiv.  Based on analysts’ projections, Microsoft will close fiscal 2023 with revenue growth below 10% for the first time since 2017. Growth for the latest quarter is expected to come in at around 7%. Businesses have been delaying cloud and software deployments since last year due to economic uncertainty and the potential for higher interest rates.  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees in May that the company won’t lift salaries this year.  Analysts polled by CNBC and by StreetAccount expect Microsoft to report about 25% year-over-year growth in revenue from the Azure public cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Microsoft doesn’t report Azure revenue in dollars. The projected growth rate is similar to what analysts expect from Google’s cloud division. Parent company Alphabet also reports results after the bell on Tuesday.  During the quarter, Microsoft built on its broad alliance with OpenAI to capitalize on fresh interest in artificial intelligence, following the November launch of the startup’s ChatGPT chatbot. Microsoft introduced a chatbot powered partly by OpenAI language models to help workers make sense of their employers’ data, and it told developers they’ll be able to build plugins that people can access through ChatGPT, the Bing search engine’s chatbot, and other tools.  Investors are eager for resolution in Microsoft’s arrangement to buy Activision Blizzard for almost $69 billion, which was agreed upon in January 2022. Earlier this month, an appeals court denied the Federal Trade Commission’s motion to stop the transaction. Activision shares have climbed past $92.50, close to the $95 that Microsoft agreed to pay, reflecting optimism that the deal is on track to close.  Microsoft shares have gained 44% year to date, while the S&P 500 is up 19%.  In June, Microsoft said it expected to take a $425 million charge in the quarter to pay a fine from Ireland’s Data Protection Commission after the authority looked at whether the company’s LinkedIn unit violated the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.

"It’s ‘really the Google web’: Microsoft CEO testifies about how hard it is to break into search during antitrust trial";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16yctw0/its_really_the_google_web_microsoft_ceo_testifies/";"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/02/microsoft-ceo-testifies-about-competing-with-google-in-antitrust-trial.html  When it comes to online search, it’s Google’s web and everyone else is playing in it, according to rival Microsoft. That was the essence of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s testimony in federal court on Monday as part of the government’s antitrust trial against Google. Nadella told the court that Google’s dominant market share in online search means that publishers and advertisers shape their content to Google’s requirements, making it harder for competitors like Microsoft’s Bing to gain a foothold.  “Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web,” Nadella said from the stand in Washington, D.C., District Court. Nadella was referring to the way publishers often cater their content and advertising to Google’s products, like by optimizing their pages for how Google ranks search results. Nadella was questioned by lawyers for the Department of Justice and a coalition of state attorneys general who are suing Google for allegedly violating antitrust laws by illegally maintaining a monopoly in the general search market. The government argues that Google locked up distribution channels for general search engines through exclusive deals with browser and phone makers to be the default choice on various devices. Perhaps the most famous of those deals is the multibillion-dollar agreement between Google and Apple to make Google search the default on Apple products like the iPhone.  The government has tried to make the case that Google’s dominance, aided by these exclusive deals, creates a flywheel effect, where greater exposure to users leads to more data to make Google’s search results better and attracts more advertisers to the product. That, in turn, generates more revenue that can be used to fund these massive distribution deals. Meanwhile, the government argues, it becomes even harder for rivals to breakthrough to consumers, and as a result, they miss out on the opportunity for greater benefits or innovations in search. Nadella affirmed that argument in his testimony Monday, describing the obstacles a general search competitor like Bing faces to gain more market share from Google.";"760";"2023-10-03T01:59:21"

"Microsoft-Activision deal moves closer as judge denies FTC injunction request";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14wtytc/microsoftactivision_deal_moves_closer_as_judge/";"[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/11/microsoft-activision-deal-moves-closer-as-judge-denies-ftc-injunction.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/11/microsoft-activision-deal-moves-closer-as-judge-denies-ftc-injunction.html)  A federal judge in San Francisco has denied the Federal Trade Commission’s motion for a preliminary injunction to stop Microsoft from completing acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard.      “This Court’s responsibility in this case is narrow. It is to decide if, notwithstanding these current circumstances, the merger should be halted—perhaps even terminated—pending resolution of the FTC administrative action,” Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley wrote in her decision, published on Tuesday. “For the reasons explained, the Court finds the FTC has not shown a likelihood it will prevail on its claim this particular vertical merger in this specific industry may substantially lessen competition. To the contrary, the record evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content. The motion for a preliminary injunction is therefore DENIED.”      The decision comes after five days of court hearings to assess whether Microsoft    would be able to complete the $68.7 billion Activision Blizzard    acquisition it announced in 2022. The judge was deciding whether to grant the FTC’s request for an emergency injunction to prevent the deal from closing.      The FTC argued Microsoft has shown an interest in making some games exclusive, to prevent them from appearing on Sony’s PlayStation or Nintendo’s Switch, and might do that if the deal were to close, while Microsoft said they would want to make Activision’s title more available, not less, partly to grow from people subscribing to its Game Pass library of games. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick both testified, as did executives from Alphabet, Nvidia and Sony.      In December the Federal Trade Commission filed suit to block the deal and have an administrative law judge at the agency assess it. But in June, before that could happen, the FTC requested a preliminary injunction to prevent Microsoft from completing the acquisition, with an eye toward bringing the case to its administrative law judge on Aug. 2. The two companies were looking to close the deal by July 18.      Kotick said during the hearings that the Activision Blizzard board didn’t see how the deal could continue if the judge were to grant the preliminary injunction.";"142";"2023-07-11T17:10:02"

Microsoft shares climbed to a record Thursday after analysts at JPMorgan Chase touted the software maker’s growth prospects in artificial intelligence.  The stock rose 3.2% to close at $348.10, topping its prior all-time high reached in November 2021, the same month the Nasdaq peaked. U.S. indexes enjoyed a broad rally, following the Federal Reserve’s announcement Wednesday that it would hold off on increasing interest rates.  AI has been a hot topic all year, after Microsoft-backed OpenAI in November released the ChatGPT chatbot, which quickly went viral. Tech companies have rushed to embed the technology into products and features and have boasted their ability to use AI to drive cost savings as recession concerns persist.  Microsoft is a major beneficiary of the rise of ChatGPT and tangential products. On top of its hefty investment in OpenAI, the company provides the underlying computing power. Microsoft also has an exclusive license on OpenAI’s models, including the GPT-4 large language model that can spit out natural-sounding words in response to a human’s text input.  Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI tools into its Bing search engine and even the Windows operating system. At the company’s event in February to announce its Bing Chatbot, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said “it’s an exciting time in tech.”  Investors want to see what it all means for Microsoft’s earnings and revenue.  In April, Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said she expects fiscal fourth-quarter growth for Azure cloud of 26% to 27% year over year in constant currency, with 1 percentage point of it coming from AI services. On Monday, in a public discussion with Microsoft technology chief Kevin Scott, Hood provided more specifics, saying that “the next generation AI business will be the fastest-growing $10 billion business in our history.”  In the past four quarters, Microsoft has generated almost $208 billion in total revenue.  Scott went deeper on Hood’s prediction.  “Because it really is a very general platform, we have lots of different ways that $10 billion of ARR is going to first show up,” he said. ARR stands for annual recurring revenue.  “There is all of the people who want to come use our infrastructure, whether they’re training their own models, whether they are running an open-source model they’ve got or whether they are making API calls into one of the big frontier models that we’ve built with OpenAI,” Scott said.  Following the event, JPMorgan analysts lifted their price target to $350 from $315.  “While MSFT continues to encounter a broad wave of cloud optimizations weighing on Azure growth, we see it planting the longer-term seeds for success across Security, Teams, Power Apps and now the forward-looking OpenAI/ChatGPT investments,” wrote the analysts, who have the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft stock.  With Microsoft’s 46% rally this year, the stock has recouped all its losses from 2022, when investors rotated out of technology in anticipation of rising interest rates and economic headwinds.  Negative sentiment around cloud growth and a contracting PC market led to pessimism on Wall Street last year. But the excitement around AI in addition to the cost-cutting measures that tech companies implemented produced a renewed bullishness. The Nasdaq is up 32% this year, doubling the gains in the S&P 500.";"499";"2023-06-16T04:14:37"

But employees of the software company aren’t allowed to use the startup’s most famous product, ChatGPT, CNBC has learned.  “Due to security and data concerns a number of AI tools are no longer available for employees to use,” Microsoft said in an update on an internal website.  Microsoft and OpenAI representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  “While it is true that Microsoft has invested in OpenAI, and that ChatGPT has built-in safeguards to prevent improper use, the website is nevertheless a third-party external service,” Microsoft said. “That means you must exercise caution using it due to risks of privacy and security. This goes for any other external AI services, such as Midjourney or Replika, as well.”  Many large companies have restricted access ChatGPT, often to prevent the sharing of confidential data. Having been trained on extensive internet data, ChatGPT composes human-like responses to people’s chat messages. The service has over 100 million users.  The ChatGPT website was blocked on Microsoft workers’ internal devices as of Thursday afternoon.  The update recommends people use Microsoft’s own Bing Chat tool, which relies on OpenAI artificial intelligence models. The two companies are closely tied.

"Microsoft and Amazon to invest $5.6 billion into France as Macron courts tech giants ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cqzxdr/microsoft_and_amazon_to_invest_56_billion_into/";"Microsoft and Amazon are ploughing billions of dollars into France.  Microsoft said in a statement Monday that it’s committing 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) toward expanding its cloud and AI infrastructure in France, in addition to funding AI skilling and support for France’s technology industry.  The company said it plans to invest bring up to 25,000 of the most advanced GPUs, or graphics processing units, to France by the end of 2025. Microsoft will also train 1 million people up and support 2,500 AI startups by 2027.  The announcement was made during the “Choose France” summit, a gathering dedicated to encouraging foreign investment in France.  “This major investment demonstrates a steadfast commitment to supporting digital innovation and economic growth in France,” said Microsoft’s President Brad Smith in a statement Monday.  “We are building state-of-the-art Cloud and AI infrastructure, training people with AI skills, and supporting French startups as they use our technology with confidence to grow in a fair and responsible way.”  As part of its investment, Microsoft will also open a new data center in the French city of Mulhouse.  Amazon, meanwhile, made a commitment of its own to invest 1.2 billion euros in France.  The money will go toward creating more than 3,000 jobs in France — in addition to the 2,000 new jobs Amazon’s already announced for 2024 — as well as broadly increasing Amazon’s footprint in the country, according to Frederic Duval, Amazon’s country manager.  “The expansion of our logistics network supports local economic development, creates quality jobs and allows us to reduce the carbon footprint of our deliveries while improving the overall customer experience,” Duval said in a statement Monday.  Collectively, the commitments from Microsoft and Amazon to France amount to $5.6 billion of funding. In total, France reportedly bagged a record 15 billion euros of investment commitments from foreign companies at an annual “Choose France” summit on Monday.  French President Emmanuel Macron has been trying to promote France as an artificial intelligence hub. Paris is already a major center of AI research and development, with Facebook having established one of its main AI labs, FAIR, there in 2015.  Last year, at the VivaTech technology fair in Paris, Macron announced 500 million euros ($540 million) in new funding to create new AI “champions,” adding to previous commitments from the government, including a promise to pump 1.5 billion euros into AI before 2022.  Microsoft is also making a charm offensive of its own with its commitment to invest billions of euros into France at a time when French officials have expressed concerns with the Redmond, Washington-based tech giant’s investment in AI startup Mistral.  Microsoft recently made a 15 million euro investment into Mistral. The deal saw Microsoft getting a stake in Mistral and the latter adding its large language model to the technology giant’s Azure cloud computing platform.  Microsoft has pushed back on competition concerns surrounding its investment in Mistral, saying that the company remains independent and that its partnership is a minority equity investment and a commercial relationship, not a merger. Britain’s competition regulator is seeking feedback on the deal.  Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/13/amazon-and-microsoft-to-invest-5point6-billion-into-france.html";"163";"2024-05-13T15:55:57"

The initiative includes the development of an artificial intelligence supercomputer named ""Stargate."" While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI.

Moreover, traders bracing for another hotter-than-expected reading on inflation were calmed after the Federal Reserve's preferred price gauge largely matched estimates.  &#x200B:  The benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) climbed 1.02% to close at 5,099.81 points. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (COMP:IND) surged 2.03% to settle at 15,927.90 points and notched its best day since February 22. The blue-chip Dow (DJI) lagged the other two indexes in terms of gains, but still rose 0.40% to conclude at 38,239.66 points.     Of the 11 S&P sectors, six ended in the green. Communication Services saw an outsized jump of nearly 5%, boosted by Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL). The two tech giants on Thursday delivered quarterly results that cemented their dominance in the AI race. Investors took heart from the reports, especially after soft guidance from Meta Platforms (META) and its heavy spending on AI had sent alarm bells ringing. The Google-parent's stock in particular clocked a double-digit rise on Friday after top boss Sundar Pichai touted that the company was ""well under way with"" its Gemini era, referring to its AI model.     The other major event today was the release of personal income and outlays data for March. The report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index - the Fed's favored inflation gauge - rose 0.3% M/M in March, matching the +0.3% consensus and flat from February's pace. On a Y/Y basis, the core PCE price index rose 2.8%, topping the +2.7% consensus but unchanged from February.     With hotter-than-expected consumer price index reports recently along with Thursday's data that showed a higher-than-anticipated jump in the Q1 core PCE price index, market participants were bracing for the worst coming into today's announcement. The largely in-line result alleviated some concerns that interest rate cuts were almost entirely off the table for 2024.     ";"74";"2024-04-26T23:14:11"

I feel like it's a matter of holding on to key business to not lose to a competitor but as far as growth there is no more. So would that equate to the share prices hovering or slightly increasing? Like in the 90s apple had a small market with their desktops then in the early 2000s started ipods laptops then the iPhone there was so much of a market to expand upon and so much money to be made. Now everyone has an iPhone and MacBook its about keeping that consumer trend going.   So if I want to make the most out of investments I need to find companies that are like apple in early 2000s.

"Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven' (apple, meta, google, Microsoft, Tesla..)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14w58g3/nasdaq_100_plans_special_rebalance_to_curb/";"From https://www.investors.com/news/nasdaq-100-plans-special-rebalance-to-curb-dominance-of-magnificent-seven/    The Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the ""magnificent seven"" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.  The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.  The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to ""address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights.""  The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.  The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.   How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted? The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.  The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.  The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.  Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.  Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.  Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.  Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.  Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.  How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut? Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.  Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.  The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.  Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023 The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.  This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.  There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.  Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices? The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.  However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&P 500, which is why S&P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.  The S&P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.  Most of the ""magnificent 7"" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.  The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.  Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.";"102";"2023-07-10T22:25:37"

"Microsoft stock hits a record high. Why its next move might be lower";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17qjq43/microsoft_stock_hits_a_record_high_why_its_next/";"Microsoft stock reached a new all-time closing high—but there could be some hiccups ahead in the short term.      Microsoft's stock rose 1.1% to $360.53 on Tuesday. That's a new closing high, topping the previous high of $359.49 set on July 18. Furthermore, Microsoft has won for eight days in a row, its longest winning streak since January 28, 2021.      The stock has been helped by the company’s strong earnings and sales, which got a boost from the Azure cloud business.      But it’s not just earnings. Microsoft was already outperforming its peers following tech weakness in August and September. Its stock has gained 15% since the end of September, outpacing Amazon.com (AMZN), which has risen 12%, Meta Platforms (META), which has risen 6.5%, Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), which is up 6%, Alphabet (GOOGL) which has ticked up 0.3%, and Tesla (TSLA), which has dropped 13%.      So, why be concerned? It all comes down to the 14-day relative strength index from Microsoft. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a measure of a stock's or index's momentum, or lack thereof. The closer it comes to 20 on the negative, the more oversold it is, while a score close to 80 indicates that the stock is extremely overbought. A value below 30 usually indicates that a stock is about to rally, while a score above 60 indicates a likely decline. Microsoft's RSI is at 72.75, indicating that it is becoming quite overbought and that a pullback is possible.      That doesn’t mean Microsoft isn’t worth buying for its long-term potential. The company has a lot to recommend, including a cloud business that should get a boost as ChatGPT, which held its developer conference yesterday, looks to expand. It just means that investors might get a better opportunity to pick up shares in the days ahead.      ";"0";"2023-11-08T12:35:51"

The company will be conducting a search for the permanent CEO successor. A spokesperson for OpenAI didn’t immediately return The Verge’s call for comment.   This is an extremely sudden turn of events. Just last week, Altman keynoted at the company’s DevDay conference, where it announced a suite of major new updates to compete with other big tech companies like Microsoft and Google. OpenAI arguably kickstarted the current AI arms race with last year’s hugely-popular ChatGPT.  Microsoft, which has invested billions in OpenAI, tells The Verge it will continue to partner with the company. “We have a long-term partnership with OpenAI and Microsoft remains committed to Mira and their team as we bring this next era of AI to our customers,” according to a statement sent by Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw.  Altman has reportedly talked with Jony Ive, Apple’s former chief design officer, about making the “iPhone of artificial intelligence,” though Altman downplayed those rumors at a recent Wall Street Journal conference. He’s also the biggest shareholder in Humane, which just launched orders for its Humane AI Pin.  Altman was a co-founder of OpenAI and initially served as a co-chair of the company alongside Elon Musk. Musk left in 2018 to avoid a conflict of interest with Tesla.   OpenAI also announced that co-founder Greg Brockman will be stepping down as chairman of the board, though Brockman will remain at the company.";"975";"2023-11-17T21:45:15"

"DOJ sues Apple over iPhone monopoly";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bk7xgd/doj_sues_apple_over_iphone_monopoly/";"The Department of Justice sued Apple on Thursday, saying its iPhone ecosystem is a monopoly that drove its “astronomical valuation” at the expense of consumers, developers and rival phone makers.  Federal antitrust enforcement and 17 attorneys general also say that Apple’s anti-competitive practices extend beyond the iPhone and Apple Watch businesses, citing Apple’s advertising, browser, FaceTime and news offerings.  “Each step in Apple’s course of conduct built and reinforced the moat around its smartphone monopoly,” the complaint filed in the District of New Jersey said. Apple shares were down around 1.8% as investors anticipated the lawsuit.  The Justice Department said in a release that to keep consumers buying iPhones, Apple moved to block cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party wallet and smartwatch compatibility and disrupted non-App Store programs and cloud-streaming services.  The challenge represents a significant risk to Apple’s walled-garden business model. The company says that complying with regulations costs the company money, could prevent it from introducing new products or services, and could hurt customer demand.  The lawsuit could force Apple to make changes in some of its most valuable businesses: The iPhone, in which Apple reported over $200 billion in sales in 2023, the Apple Watch, part of the company’s $40 billion wearables business, and its profitable services line, which reported $85 billion in revenue.  “If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the release.  Apple said in a statement that it disagreed with the premise of the lawsuit and that it would defend against it.  “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect,” an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. “It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”  The lawsuit follows years of investigations into Apple’s business practices and two prior DOJ cases against Apple: One over e-book prices and another over allegations that it colluded with other technology companies to depress salaries.  “This anticompetitive behavior is designed to maintain Apple’s monopoly power while extracting as much revenue as possible,” the complaint said.  iMessage, Apple Watch, and cloud gaming  The complaint highlights comments from CEO Tim Cook and other executives. Some users have asked Apple to improve Android-to-iPhone messaging. Developers have gone as far as creating apps that can circumvent the platform limitations, only to be shut down by Apple.  Prosecutors highlighted one exchange between Cook and a consumer.  “Not to make it personal but I can’t send my mom certain videos,” the complaint says one user told Cook, referring to a 2022 interview at a Vox Media event.  “Buy your mom an iPhone,” Cook responded.  The DOJ is also focusing on Apple’s smartwatch, Apple Watch, saying the company designed it to only work with iPhones, and not Android devices. The company’s decision means that “users who purchase the Apple Watch face substantial out-of-pocket costs if they do not keep buying iPhones,” according to the complaint.  The DOJ said Apple has fought cloud streaming services on its App Store platform, blocking consumer access to high-quality video games on iPhones, echoing complaints from Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta.  Apple has faced several significant antitrust challenges more recently, largely focused on its control over the iPhone App Store. It mostly won in a civil suit against Epic Games in 2021, although it made concessions during the trial and had to make some changes to its policies under California law.  “Today’s lawsuit seeks to hold Apple accountable and ensure it cannot deploy the same, unlawful playbook in other vital markets,” Assistant Attorney General for antitrust Jonathan Kanter said in the release.  The company is currently jockeying with the European Commission over whether it’s complying with a new Digital Markets Act, which forces Apple to open up the iPhone app store to rivals such as Microsoft or Epic Games. Apple plans to charge big companies that eschew its app store 50 cents per download.  Apple was fined $2 billion in the EU over a dispute with Spotify about whether the music streaming service can link to its website and account system inside of its app.  Apple had 64% of the market share for U.S. iPhones in the last quarter of 2023, versus 18% for Samsung, according to Counterpoint Research.  Apple isn’t the only big tech company facing government scrutiny. The DOJ filed an antitrust case against Google in 2020 over its dominant search position and another year over its advertising business. The DOJ also famously sued Microsoft in the 1990s, eventually forcing it to allow users to unbundle the Internet Explorer browser from the Windows operating system.

"Nvidia announces Blackwell AI chips that will launch later this year";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bi129l/nvidia_announces_blackwell_ai_chips_that_will/";"Nvidia on Monday announced a new generation of artificial intelligence chips and software for running AI models. The announcement, made during Nvidia’s developer’s conference in San Jose, comes as the chipmaker seeks to solidify its position as the go-to supplier for AI companies.  Nvidia’s share price is up five-fold and total sales have more than tripled since OpenAI’s ChatGPT kicked off the AI boom in late 2022. Nvidia’s high-end server GPUs are essential for training and deploying large AI models. Companies like Microsoft and Meta have spent billions of dollars buying the chips.  The new generation of AI graphics processors is named Blackwell. The first Blackwell chip is called the GB200 and will ship later this year. Nvidia is enticing its customers with more powerful chips to spur new orders. Companies and software makers, for example, are still scrambling to get their hands on the current generation of H100s and similar chips.  “Hopper is fantastic, but we need bigger GPUs,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Monday at the company’s developer conference in San Jose, California. “Let me introduce you to a very big GPU.”  The company also introduced revenue-generating software called NIM that will make it easier to deploy AI, giving customers another reason to stick with Nvidia chips over a rising field of competitors.  Nvidia executives say that the company is becoming less of a mercenary chip provider and more of a platform provider, like Microsoft or Apple, on which other companies can build software.  “The sellable commercial product was the GPU and the software was all to help people use the GPU in different ways,” said Nvidia enterprise VP Manuvir Das in an interview. “Of course, we still do that. But what’s really changed is, we really have a commercial software business now.”  Das said Nvidia’s new software will make it easier to run programs on any of Nvidia’s GPUs, even older ones that might be better suited for deploying but not building AI.  “If you’re a developer, you’ve got an interesting model you want people to adopt, if you put it in a NIM, we’ll make sure that it’s runnable on all our GPUs, so you reach a lot of people,” Das said.  Every two years Nvidia updates its GPU architecture, unlocking a big jump in performance. Many of the AI models released over the past year were trained on the company’s Hopper architecture — used by chips such as the H100 — which was announced in 2022.  Nvidia says Blackwell-based processors, like the GB200, offer a huge performance upgrade for AI companies, with 20 petaflops in AI performance versus 4 petaflops for the H100. The additional processing power will enable AI companies to train bigger and more intricate models, Nvidia said.  The chip includes what Nvidia calls a “transformer engine specifically built to run transformers-based AI, one of the core technologies underpinning ChatGPT.  The Blackwell GPU is large and combines two separately manufactured dies into one chip manufactured by TSMC. It will also be available as an entire server called the GB200 NVLink 2, combining 72 Blackwell GPUs and other Nvidia parts designed to train AI models.  Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle will sell access to the GB200 through cloud services. The GB200 pairs two B200 Blackwell GPUs with one Arm-based Grace CPU. Nvidia said Amazon Web Services would build a server cluster with 20,000 GB200 chips.  Nvidia said that the system can deploy a 27-trillion-parameter model. That’s much larger than even the biggest models, such as GPT-4, which reportedly has 1.7 trillion parameters. Many artificial intelligence researchers believe bigger models with more parameters and data could unlock new capabilities.  Nvidia didn’t provide a cost for the new GB200 or the systems it’s used in. Nvidia’s Hopper-based H100 costs between $25,000 and $40,000 per chip, with whole systems that cost as much as $200,000, according to analyst estimates.  Nvidia also announced it’s adding a new product named NIM to its Nvidia enterprise software subscription.  NIM makes it easier to use older Nvidia GPUs for inference, or the process of running AI software, and will allow companies to continue to use the hundreds of millions of Nvidia GPUs they already own. Inference requires less computational power than the initial training of a new AI model. NIM enables companies that want to run their own AI models, instead of buying access to AI results as a service from companies like OpenAI.  The strategy is to get customers who buy Nvidia-based servers to sign up for Nvidia enterprise, which costs $4,500 per GPU per year for a license.  Nvidia will work with AI companies like Microsoft or Hugging Face to ensure their AI models are tuned to run on all compatible Nvidia chips. Then, using a NIM, developers can efficiently run the model on their own servers or cloud-based Nvidia servers without a lengthy configuration process.  “In my code, where I was calling into OpenAI, I will replace one line of code to point it to this NIM that I got from Nvidia instead,” Das said.  Nvidia says the software will also help AI run on GPU-equipped laptops, instead of on servers in the cloud.

"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) $171 A good long term buy";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anrsxh/advanced_micro_devices_amd_171_a_good_long_term/";"\#AMD’s MI300 chips will be its growth engine for the future and the key reason for buying this stock. While I don’t believe it will get close to Nvidia’s near monopolistic market share of 80% there is ample room for more competitors and AMD will benefit from the AI boom as well.   It recently upped its guidance for 2024 for artificial intelligence-related revenue to $3.5B up from $2B previously.  $AMD Chief Executive Dr. Lisa Su said she had ""good confidence"" the company will be able to exceed the $3.5B figure this year and the $1.5B run-rate for the coming fourth-quarter. $1.5Bn run rate implies $6Bn in annual sales.   However, based on Citi analyst estimates, AMD is likely to generate $5B this year and $8B next year from the MI300 - they believe that Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are the largest customers for the MI300, which was unveiled in December to much fanfare. And with the average selling price at roughly $10,000 for Microsoft and $15,000 or more for other customers, it's possible AMD is purposefully underestimating sales figures, possibly on supply concerns?   For Q4-2023 AMD results were in line with expectations   EPS: $0.77 per share, adjusted, versus $0.77 per share expected   Revenue: $6.17 billion, versus $6.12 billion expected   Data Center revenue $2.28Bn in line V $2.29 expected.   Guidance was light:   Q1-24 $5.4Bn in sales, plus or minus $300 million, V $5.73 Bn expected.   Flat data center revenue with server chip declines to be offset by AI GPU sales. We saw weak data center revenue from Intel, this is definitely some cannibalization and likely to continue, till AI GPU starts taking a larger share of the pie.   Client Group - The recovery in PC’s helped AMD’s client group, which rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.   Gaming, which includes “semi-custom” processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a “significant” double-digit percentage in the current quarter. This is a low margin business and drags AMD’s overall margins.   AMD’s embedded segment, which includes chips for networking, reported $1.1 billion in sales, down 24% on an annual basis.";"257";"2024-02-10T23:08:45"

Google pays Apple more than a third of its search advertising revenue from Safari under the terms of the two companies’ search default agreement, an Alphabet  witness said in open court Monday amid a protracted antitrust battle between Google and the Department of Justice.  The 36% figure, which was not previously known to the public, is one of the clearest indications of how lucrative Google’s search deal has been for both Apple and the search engine company. Both companies have fought to limit revealing the deals’ details, citing potentially anticompetitive effects.  The incidental disclosure from Alphabet’s expert witness Kevin Murphy, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, was not expected. Murphy’s testimony came as part of the company’s efforts to fight the Justice Department’s claims that the company illegally maintains dominance over search and advertising markets.  Williams & Connolly antitrust partner John Schmidtlein visibly cringed when Murphy revealed the number, Bloomberg News reported.  The search default agreement is a major focus of the proceedings. Judge Amit Mehta has described the Apple-Google deal as the “heart” of the case. It’s a number Wall Street pays attention to as well. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi has estimated in a note to clients that Apple would see $19 billion in 2023 revenue as a result of the search engine default deal with Google.  Neither Apple nor Google immediately responded to a request for comment.  Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai defended such deals when he testified in the proceedings. But Google’s competitors have described the arrangement as damaging to their business. Microsoft  CEO Satya Nadella, for example, pushed back in detail when he testified in October.  Nadella said that “every year” he had held the top job at Microsoft, he had “dialogues” with Apple over a default search engine deal for Microsoft’s Bing, even if that meant billions in short-term losses. Nothing had yet come of those talks, Nadella said.  Nadella said that the idea of an “open web” was a misnomer. “Everybody talks about the open web, but there really is the Google web,” he said on the stand.";"553";"2023-11-14T16:30:14"

"Amazon spends $2.75B on AI startup Anthropic, its largest venture investment";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bp6rv9/amazon_spends_275b_on_ai_startup_anthropic_its/";"Amazon is making its largest outside investment in its three-decade history as it looks to gain an edge in the artificial intelligence race.   The tech giant said it will spend another $2.75 billion backing Anthropic, a San Francisco-based startup that’s widely viewed as a frontrunner in generative artificial intelligence. Its foundation model and chatbot Claude competes with OpenAI and ChatGPT.  The companies announced an initial $1.25 billion investment in September, and said at the time that Amazon would invest up to $4 billion. Wednesday’s news marks Amazon’s second tranche of that funding.  Amazon will maintain a minority stake in the company and won’t have an Anthropic board seat, the company said. The deal was struck at the AI startup’s last valuation, which was $18.4 billion, according to a source.   Over the past year, Anthropic closed five different funding deals worth about $7.3 billion — and with the new Amazon investment, the total exceeds $10 billion. The company’s product directly competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT in both the enterprise and consumer worlds, and it was founded by ex-OpenAI research executives and employees.  News of the Amazon investment comes weeks after Anthropic debuted Claude 3, its newest suite of AI models that it says are its fastest and most powerful yet. The company said the most capable of its new models outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini Ultra on industry benchmark tests, such as undergraduate level knowledge, graduate level reasoning and basic mathematics.  “Generative AI is poised to be the most transformational technology of our time, and we believe our strategic collaboration with Anthropic will further improve our customers’ experiences, and look forward to what’s next,” said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of data and AI at AWS.  Amazon’s move is the latest in a spending blitz among cloud providers to stay ahead in the AI race. And it’s the second update in a week to Anthropic’s capital structure. Late Friday, bankruptcy filings showed crypto exchange FTX struck a deal with a group of buyers to sell the majority of its stake in Anthropic, confirming a CNBC report from last week.  The term generative AI entered the mainstream and business vernacular seemingly overnight, and the field has exploded over the past year, with a record $29.1 billion invested across nearly 700 deals in 2023, according to PitchBook. OpenAI’s ChatGPT first showcased the tech’s ability to produce human-like language and creative content in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has said more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted the platform, spanning industries such as financial services, legal applications and education.  Cloud providers like Amazon Web Services don’t want to be caught flat-footed.  It’s a symbiotic relationship. As part of the agreement, Anthropic said it will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. It will also use Amazon chips to train, build and deploy its foundation models. Amazon has been designing its own chips that may eventually compete with Nvidia.   Microsoft has been on its own spending spree with a high-profile investment into OpenAI. Microsoft’s OpenAI bet has reportedly jumped to $13 billion as the startup’s valuation has topped $29 billion. Microsoft’s Azure is also OpenAI’s exclusive provider for computing power, which means the startup’s success and new business flows back to Microsoft’s cloud servers.  Google, meanwhile, has also backed Anthropic, with its own deal for Google Cloud. It agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic, comprising a $500 million cash infusion, with another $1.5 billion to be invested over time. Salesforce is also a backer.  Anthropic’s new model suite, announced earlier this month, marks the first time the company has offered “multimodality,” or adding options like photo and video capabilities to generative AI.  But multimodality, and increasingly complex AI models, also lead to more potential risks. Google recently took its AI image generator, part of its Gemini chatbot, offline after users discovered historical inaccuracies and questionable responses, which circulated widely on social media.  Anthropic’s Claude 3 does not generate images: instead, it only allows users to upload images and other documents for analysis.  “Of course no model is perfect, and I think that’s a very important thing to say upfront,” Anthropic co-founder Daniela Amodei told CNBC earlier this month. “We’ve tried very diligently to make these models the intersection of as capable and as safe as possible. Of course there are going to be places where the model still makes something up from time to time.”  Amazon’s biggest venture bet before Anthropic was electric vehicle maker Rivian, where it invested more than $1.3 billion. That too, was a strategic partnership.   These partnerships have been picking up in the face of more antitrust scrutiny. A drop in acquisitions by the Magnificent Seven — Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla — has been offset by an increase in venture-style investing, according to Pitchbook.  AI and machine-learning investments from those seven tech companies jumped to $24.6 billion last year, up from $4.4 billion in 2022, according to Pitchbook. At the same time, Big Tech’s M&A deals fell from 40 deals in 2022 to 13 last year.   “There is a sort of paranoia motivation to invest in potential disruptors,” Pitchbook AI analyst, Brendan Burke, said in an interview. “The other motivation is to increase sales, and to invest in companies that are likely to use the other company’s product — they tend to be partners, more so than competitors.”  Big Tech’s spending spree in AI has come under fire for the seemingly circular nature of these agreements. By investing in AI startups, some, including Benchmark’s Bill Gurley have accused the tech giants of funneling cash back to their cloud businesses, which in turn, may show up as revenue. Gurley described it as a way to “goose your own revenues.”  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is taking a closer look at these partnerships, including Microsoft’s OpenAI deal and Google and Amazon’s Anthropic investments. What’s sometimes called “round tripping” can be illegal — especially if the aim is to mislead investors. But Amazon has said that this type of venture investing does not constitute round tripping.  FTC Chair Lina Khan announced the inquiry during the agency’s tech summit on AI, describing it as a “market inquiry into the investments and partnerships being formed between AI developers and major cloud service providers.”  Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/27/amazon-spends-2point7b-on-startup-anthropic-in-largest-venture-investment.html";"639";"2024-03-27T17:54:55"

"Google unveils custom Arm-based chips ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bzyx8m/google_unveils_custom_armbased_chips/";"Google is trying to make cloud computing more affordable with a custom-built Arm-based server chip. At its Cloud Next conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday, the company said the new processor will become available later in 2024.  With the new Arm-based chip, Google is playing catch-up with rivals such as Amazon and Microsoft, which have been employing a similar strategy for years. The tech giants compete fiercely in the growing market for cloud infrastructure, where organizations rent out resources in faraway data centers and pay based on usage.  Google parent Alphabet still derives three-quarters of revenue from advertising, but cloud is growing faster and now represents almost 11% of company revenue. The segment, which contains corporate productivity applications, is also profitable. Google held 7.5% of the cloud infrastructure market in 2022, while Amazon and Microsoft together controlled around 62%, according to Gartner estimates.  Market leader Amazon Web Services introduced its Graviton Arm chip in 2018. “Almost all their services are already ported and optimized on the Arm ecosystem,” Chirag Dekate, an analyst at technology industry researcher Gartner, told CNBC in an interview. Graviton has picked up business from Datadog, Elastic, Snowflake and Sprinklr, among others.  Alibaba announced Arm processors in 2021, and Microsoft did the same in November.  Arm isn’t completely new to Google, which started selling access to virtual machines, or VMs, that use Oracle-backed startup Ampere’s Arm-based chips earlier this year.  Porting applications to Arm machines has made sense for organizations seeking to reduce spending on cloud computing because of economic worries. When Arm Holdings filed to go public last year, it pointed to Amazon’s claim that Graviton could give up to 40% better price performance than comparable server instances, such as the common “x86” model used by AMD and Intel processors.  Google has used Arm-based server computers for internal purposes to run YouTube advertising, the BigTable and Spanner databases, and the BigQuery data analytics tool. The company will gradually move them over to the cloud-based Arm instances, which are named Axion, when they become available, a spokesperson said.  Datadog and Elastic plan to adopt Axion, along with OpenX and Snap, the spokesperson said.  Broader use of chips drawing on Arm’s architecture might lead to lower carbon emissions for certain workloads. Virtual slices of physical servers containing the Axion chips deliver 60% more energy efficiency than comparable VMs based on the x86 model, Google cloud chief Thomas Kurian wrote in a blog post. Arm chips, which are popular in smartphones, offer a shorter set of instructions than x86 chips, which are commonly found in PCs.  The chips can also speed up applications.  Axion offers 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based virtual machines in the cloud and 50% better performance than comparable VMs based on x86, Google said.  “I think it completes their portfolio,” Dekate said.

"Nvidia passes Alphabet in market cap, now the third most valuable U.S. company";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ar26eu/nvidia_passes_alphabet_in_market_cap_now_the/";"Nvidia surpassed Google parent Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday. It’s the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmaker’s stock soaring.  Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Google’s $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.  The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.  Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.  Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques — such as transformer architecture — used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.  Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a “code red” situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.

Nvidia’s shares have to hold above $404.86 to maintain that distinction throughout the day. The chipmaker’s stock rocketed last week after it posted quarterly earnings with top- and bottom-line numbers that significantly beat consensus estimates. Nvidia’s gain buoyed other chipmakers, with the notable exception of Intel, and was also fueled in part by estimates that were more optimistic than expected.  Significantly, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 alone. Expected sales were 50% higher than consensus estimates of $7.15 billion. It’s been a banner year for chipmakers, parts of the tech industry and the Nasdaq, driven in part by the AI frenzy and the possibility of slowing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Alongside Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were also buoyed in last week’s trading.  Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, are critical to generative AI platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard. The company has historically been a leader in the so-called “discrete” or standalone GPU field, but until recently, many consumers thought of GPUs as primarily used for intensive gaming. The advent of crypto mining and AI has upended that belief, and GPU manufacturers and suppliers, including Nvidia, AMD and TSMC, have seen share prices rise significantly over the last few months. By contrast, Intel, which struggled with inventory issues and development challenges, has been historically focused on the chip market for central processing units, or CPUs. The company hasn’t shared, comparatively, in the wave of investor interest.";"1437";"2023-05-30T15:56:48"

Apple is specifically looking to partner on cloud-based generative AI, with today’s report citing text and image generation as examples of what Gemini could be used for. At the same time, Apple is working on offering its own on-device AI models and capabilities with the upcoming iOS 18 release. The discussions are still underway, and it’s unclear how the AI agreement will be branded. This would be a significant expansion of the existing relationship — default search engine — between the two companies. Looking at the rest of the industry, Google announced a partnership with Samsung in February to have Gemini power summarization features in the Galaxy S24’s notes and voice recording apps, as well as keyboard. Samsung is also using Imagen 2 text-to-image diffusion for a generative editing feature in the photo gallery app. Those features all require server-side processing, but Samsung is also using an on-device version of Gemini.

"Amazon to invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, a rival to ChatGPT developer OpenAI";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16rmvdx/amazon_to_invest_up_to_4_billion_in_anthropic_a/";"E-commerce giant Amazon on Monday said it will invest up to $4 billion in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic and take a minority ownership position in the company.The move underscores Amazon’s aggressive AI push as it looks to keep pace with rivals such as Microsoft and Alphabet’sGoogle.  Anthropic was founded roughly two years ago by former OpenAI research executives and recently debuted its new AI chatbot called Claude 2. Amazon is looking to capitalize on the hype and promise of so-called generative AI, which includes technology like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, as well as Anthropic’s Claude chatbots.  The two firms on Monday said that they are forming a strategic collaboration to advance generative AI, with the startup selecting Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider. Anthropic said it will provide AWS customers with early access to unique features for model customization and fine-tuning capabilities.  Anthropic will also use custom AWS-designed semiconductors to train the foundational models that underpin its AI applications. Foundation models are large AI programs trained on vast amounts of data so that they can be adapted to solve a wide range of tasks.   This year, chip firm Nvidia is the chip firm that has seen the biggest gains from the generative AI boom. Nvidia’s key product is a type of semiconductor known as a graphics processing unit, which can be used to train huge AI models. At one point Nvidia’s stock had rallied more than 200%, as the company smashed through financial forecasts on the rising adoption of AI.  To an extent, Amazon’s deal with Anthropic aims to show that there are alternative chips that can be used for AI applications. AWS customers will be able to build on Anthropic’s AI models via Amazon Bedrock — a service that lets customers build generative AI applications in the cloud via existing models, rather than train their own models.  Amazon is looking to position itself as the one-stop shop for AI. The e-commerce giant designs its own chips for training huge AI models. Through Amazon Bedrock customers can also design their own generative AI applications using existing models, which are all run on the Amazon cloud. The company sells its own AI applications too.  Anthropic already counts some high-profile backers, including Google and Salesforce Ventures. This support comes as tech giants continue to make massive bets on AI companies, a move sparked by Microsoft’s multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI in January.  https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/25/amazon-to-invest-up-to-4-billion-in-anthropic-a-rival-to-chatgpt-developer-openai.html";"461";"2023-09-25T11:01:26"

Right when coronavirus was getting 'better' I exited all my positions and invested my money pretty much in 3 companies, Amazon, Microsoft and Alibaba. (33% each)  around 60k in alibaba, at 185€  Theoretically a good stock, e-commerce in china is not bad, alibaba-cloud is a good thing, massive company, numbers looked good. I'd still say that it's a good stock, if only there was no CCP.  So, it's been going down for the last few years, we're currently at ~66€, it was already this low like 1-2 years ago, recovered, now down again. 66% down for me.  I'm not rich at all, where others bought a department or something I have my money in stocks, and a third of it is about to be wiped out possibly. Honestly I don't think alibaba is going anywhere but who knows what the CCP will do and if/when it will recover, to 120€ / 180€, who knows.  Meanwhile the spy and all other stocks im interested in are at their alltime-high, i'm not about to sell with 66% loss, invest in something else, only for the market to go down because thats's how it goes.  For the last 3 years I thought ""let's wait and see"", and, well, I'm not exactly thrilled. Yeah it's trading at 7 PE, if we get positive indicators it could go back to 120€ I guess, already did that 1 year ago.  Any opinion on this situation? Feeling pretty bad about this.

Right?   It seemed like the risk to reward was there but I think the moral of the story is: don’t buy garbage companies and expect them to fly up. I have played various other merger plays with good success but this one went against my idea of buying decent companies. **Without the merger, IRBT is still overvalued at current prices.**  If you are still in this, the risks of blockage are higher than I expected because AMZN isn’t willing to play ball. Also, considering AMZN dropped the acquisition price previously, it is possible they will drop it again due to the massive drop in price recently. Good luck to anyone who is still playing this.   All and all, lost a good chunk of money, sold, and I’ve learned my lesson: **if you aren’t willing to hold the underlying, don’t buy it just solely for the merger.**";"178";"2024-01-19T16:17:07"

"Google commits to invest $2 billion in OpenAI competitor Anthropic";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17i8ysv/google_commits_to_invest_2_billion_in_openai/";"Google agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic, the artificial intelligence startup founded by ex-OpenAI executives, CNBC has confirmed. The commitment involves a $500 million upfront cash infusion and an additional $1.5 billion to be invested over time, an Anthropic spokesperson told CNBC. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on the planned financing. A Google spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to request for comment.  Anthropic is the developer of Claude 2, a rival chatbot to OpenAI’s ChatGPT that’s used by companies including Slack, Notion and Quora. The company was founded in 2021 and, in addition to Google, has received funding from Salesforce and Zoom and was valued earlier this year at $4.1 billion. Claude 2 has the ability to summarize up to about 75,000 words, which could be the length of a book. Users can input large data sets and ask for summaries in the form of a memo, letter or story. ChatGPT, by contrast, can handle about 3,000 words.  Research by Arthur AI, a machine learning monitoring platform, found Claude 2 to be most reliable chatbot in terms of “self-awareness,” meaning accurately gauging what it does and doesn’t know, and answering only questions it had training data to support. Arthur AI tested chatbots from Meta, Cohere and OpenAI.  In April, Google invested $300 million in the company, taking a 10% stake. That same month, Anthropic was one of four companies invited to a meeting at the White House to discuss responsible AI development with Vice President Kamala Harris. Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and OpenAI were the others.  Anthropic quickly turned around and raised a $450 million round in May. At the time, it marked the largest funding round for an AI company since Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI in January, according to PitchBook data.Anthropic was founded by Dario Amodei, OpenAI’s former vice president of research, and his sister, Daniela Amodei, who was OpenAI’s vice president of safety and policy. Several other OpenAI research alumni were also on Anthropic’s founding team.  Amodei told CNBC in July that Anthropic invested at least two months in developing its newest chatbot, with a team of 30 to 35 people working directly on the AI model and a total of 150 people supporting it. She said the market is growing so rapidly that there’s plenty of room for multiple players to succeed.  “It’s a really unusual time from a business perspective because there’s just so much demand for large language models and really more demand than the industry can currently provide,” Amodei said at the time. “The landscape is just very wide, and there’s really quite a lot of room for many different users and types of users to make use of these systems.”  https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/27/google-commits-to-invest-2-billion-in-openai-competitor-anthropic.html";"298";"2023-10-28T10:01:16"

Now called “Meta Horizon OS,” the open system allows developers to access technologies like eye, face, hand, and body tracking, high-resolution passthrough, and more.  Three major tech players—Asus, Lenovo and Microsoft’s Xbox—are the first companies to confirm they’ll be developing new devices that run the software. Most notably, Microsoft is teaming up with Meta to build a “limited-edition Meta Quest, inspired by Xbox,” according to the announcement. Asus and Lenovo, on the other hand, are building headsets designed for specific use cases. Asus is developing a headset dedicated to gaming whereas Lenovo wants its device to be for “productivity, learning, and entertainment.”  The company says all future headsets can connect via the same Meta Quest app on iOS and Android. Plus, the Meta Quest Store, which the company renamed the Meta Horizon Store, is open to third-party developers, allowing them to use Meta’s frameworks and tools to create new mixed-reality experiences.  Meta Horizon OS is a strategic move for the company and comes at a time when the VR/AR headset wars between Meta, Apple and Sony continue to heat up.

"Once a Hot Stock-Market Trend Has a Name, Its Best Days Are Likely to be over";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b3xvkb/once_a_hot_stockmarket_trend_has_a_name_its_best/";"Derek Horstmeyer(repost)  *Once a stock-market trend has been identified and named -- think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven -- the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.*      *To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Marín Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.*      *The final list of named trends we researched was:*      *-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.*      *-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.*      *-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.*      *-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestlé, L'Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.*      *-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.*      *-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.*      *-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.*      *-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce*      *Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.*      *From first mention*      *Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.*      *For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S&P 500.*      *The first interesting finding: When we look at the average of all these eight named trends, we see considerable price run-up before the trade being named. For the 24 months before the zero-date, we see the average named trend deliver 36% in excess returns. This means that if you magically knew about a new named trend before it happened, you could earn 36 percentage points above the S&P 500 for the two years before it was named.*      *Worth the ride, until...*      *But even if you don't have this magical foresight, it still doesn't hurt to ride a trend once it has been coined. On average, once the trend has been named and looking ahead 12 months, an investor can still earn about 13 percentage points in excess returns.*      *Yet 12 months following the naming is about the best you can do as returns peak at this point on average and decrease a bit subsequently. From the 12-month mark to the 24-month mark after a trend has been named, the average named trend lags behind the S&P 500 by about 2 percentage points.*      *When we look at the individual named trends, it might surprise people that the two best trades from the zero-date to the 24-month mark in our sample were the BAT and Cloud trends -- both earning more than 60% in excess return over the two-year period once they were coined by the press.*      *On the other end, the MT SAAS trade did the worst, dropping more than 95% in excess returns over the two-year period after being named.*      *All in all, this means your best option is to jump on a named trend as soon as you first hear about it -- provided you haven't been too late to the party -- and ride the initial momentum, if it happens. But if you get in past the 12-month mark, the returns might not be so magnificent.*";"154";"2024-03-01T17:04:21"

Intel has had a few rocky quarters in mid 2022 to mid 2023, but it seems like they could be also on the verge of a turn around. They recently signed a 15 billion dollar deal with Microsoft, and they're currently in negotiations to make chips for the US military.  **Key stats for NVDA**  * Yearly Revenue: 44.87B * Net Income: 18.88B * PE Ratio: 80 * Net Assets/Shareholder Equity: 33.3B * Market Cap: 2.38T  **Key stats for INTC**  * Yearly Revenue: 54.23B * Net Income: 1.69B * PE Ratio: 114 * Net Assets/Shareholder Equity: 110B * Market Cap: 195B  Effectively what this means is that Intel has more revenue, more shareholder equity, and 1/10 the market cap of NVDA. Their profitability took a huge hit in 2022, but their most recent quarters have seen them return to net positive. A bet on NVDA at this point seems to be a bet on continued parabolic growth and long term sustainability of their insane profit margins. On the other hand, it seems like Intel is undervalued and poised as a possible underdog to step up and take some market share. If the chip sector continues its rally then it seems like INTC could be a good bet. If the entire chip sector crashes and burns, Intel's potential downside is very low, with their stock price only 77% above book value.

"Tim Cook teases Apple AI announcement ‘later this year’";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1agtkhe/tim_cook_teases_apple_ai_announcement_later_this/";"Apple CEO Tim Cook teased that Apple may have an artificial intelligence announcement later this year during a call with analysts after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings.  While Cook’s remarks on Thursday did not include many details, they did indicate that Apple wants to compete with Microsoft, Google, Amazon, OpenAI and other technology companies working on cutting-edge AI models that can generate text and images.  “As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future,” Cook said during a call with analysts. “That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we’re excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.”  Generative AI started drawing significant attention from technology companies and investors starting in 2022, after OpenAI released ChatGPT and image generators rapidly improved. Apple did not announce an advanced AI model last year, although the company has long invested in similar machine learning technology in its chips and software, which can, for example, identify people or pets inside photographs.  Apple typically announces new software in June at its annual developer’s conference, WWDC. Last year, the company announced an autocorrect feature for the iPhone keyboard based on a transformer-based language model, which shares the same underlying technology as GPT. But Apple never used the phrase “artificial intelligence” during the presentation, preferring the more academic term “machine learning.”  “Let me just say that I think there’s a huge opportunity for Apple with Gen AI and AI, without getting into more details and getting out in front of myself,” Cook said.

"EA to lay off 5% of workforce, or about 670 employees";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b2knaw/ea_to_lay_off_5_of_workforce_or_about_670/";"Electronic Arts  announced Wednesday that it will cut 5% of its workforce, part of a plan that includes reducing office space and ending work on some video games.  EA employed 13,400 workers as of the end of March 2023, according to its most recent annual filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May. That means the layoffs may affect about 670 jobs.  The company’s announcement marks the latest headcount reduction among video game developers in recent months, continuing a broader trend of significant downsizing across the tech industry.   On Tuesday, Sony said it would lay off about 900 employees in its PlayStation division, or 8% of its workforce. Last month, Microsoft cut 1,900 jobs across its gaming unit three months after it acquired Activision Blizzard, and Tencent’s Riot Games slashed 11% of its workforce.  EA CEO Andrew Wilson wrote in a memo to employees on Wednesday that the video game company is “streamlining our company operations to deliver deeper, more connected experiences for fans everywhere.”  The cuts will support EA’s “strategic priorities and growth initiatives,” according to a Wednesday filing with the SEC. The company expects its restructuring plan will be “substantially complete” by the end of December.  “We are continuing to optimize our global real estate footprint to best support our business,” Wilson wrote in his Wednesday note. “We are also sunsetting games and moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry.”  Wilson added that the cuts will enable EA to focus more on its “biggest opportunities — including our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities.”   During the company’s third-quarter earnings call last month, Wilson said the company would focus on continuing to invest in its existing gaming franchises attracting large online audiences, including Apex Legends, Battlefield, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL and The Sims.

"Big Tech (Google and Meta) begins to give out dividend";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cgy1w4/big_tech_google_and_meta_begins_to_give_out/";"Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia been giving out dividends for a long time despite being a huge tech firm.   As of recently, Google and Meta decide to begin giving out dividends to its shareholders. Is this seen as bullish?   We hold big tech firms due to huge earning growth potential and they tend to distribute their earnings into innovation and R&D, which will with no doubt boost their future earning if done right.   Now that Google and Meta begin to give out dividend, it seems appealing for mutual fund managers to add more into their portfolios, which will boost their stock prices further. But this will probably hurt their future earning potential in long term as they will have less allocated to R&D. What do y'all think?   This will also give pressure to Amazon to consider offering dividend to their shareholders. Tesla? I don't think so. ";"94";"2024-04-30T19:10:00"

Today, as I sold over 1000 shares accumulated over these years at 2.95$, I'm realizing the importance of reading annual and earnings reports. It was always going to end up a penny stock and it's not even a benefit of hindsight. The stock never deserved to go beyond a buck.   Just an advice to all the bag holders out there. Don't let emotions and news interfere with business numbers. Fundamentals will always trump everything. I'm glad my Apple and Microsoft are 50-80% up but well, PLUG will remain my life lesson on doing due diligences, not getting caught up in meme stocks, always setting a stop limit sell price, and um not being stupid in general  Peace out.

"Apple Unveils Vision Pro AR/VR Headset, Its First Major New Product In Nearly A Decade";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/141nmds/apple_unveils_vision_pro_arvr_headset_its_first/";"On Monday, Apple unveiled its much-anticipated mixed reality headset, the Vision Pro, the tech giant’s first major new product category since 2015’s Apple Watch.  The new device, packed with cameras and sensors, looks like a futuristic pair of ski goggles, and can immerse a wearer in virtual reality but also blend in the real-world elements of augmented reality. CEO Tim Cook announced the new product at the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference held at its sparkling Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino, CA.  Apple’s virtual reality plans date back roughly a decade, and Cook has been teasing his ambitions publicly for the better part of that time. As far back as 2016, the company filed patents for lightweight eyeglasses and a bulkier device. But while Cook reportedly preferred the more compact option, according to reports by Bloomberg, the technical challenge forced Apple to change its strategy.  The device announcement comes years after other Silicon Valley juggernauts including Meta and Google parent Alphabet have tried to bring high-tech headsets into the mainstream. Facebook in 2014 bought the startup Oculus for $2 billion and has released two generations of its Meta Quest, geared mostly toward gamers. Microsoft in 2016 made a big bet on its Hololens headset, a 3D augmented reality device, but has failed to gain traction with consumers. Google made the buzziest splash more than a decade ago with its disastrous Google Glass, a sleek headset with a camera on board. The product drew immediate outrage, with early adopters dubbed “glassholes.”  Apple has rarely been first to new product categories, instead letting other companies take the lead while it developed products it hoped could dominate over rivals. Apple was beat to market in mp3 players, smartphones, tablets and smartwatches, but its iPods, iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches have all become category-defining devices.  Apple will have a bigger challenge ahead as it asks people to put its latest product directly on their faces for everyday use—an aim which has eluded all its well-capitalized predecessors. Today’s headsets often lead to people complaining about the devices overheating, being too heavy to wear for too long or leaving sweaty foreheads. Others have found the experience of being disconnected to the real world—immersed in full-on virtual reality for long periods of time—too isolating. Cook said in an interview with GQ earlier this year that Apple’s device could increase collaboration, though Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision to achieve a similar effect in the workplace has failed to take off.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2023/06/05/apple-unveils-reality-pro-arvr-headset-its-first-major-new-product-in-nearly-a-decade/?sh=15606f2d37e8";"1149";"2023-06-05T20:29:40"

Seems they got all the chips they need. They also lowered guidance going forward.  -These earnings are crucial for NVDA, this could determine the next steps for the AI cycle.  -Theres also growing competition in chip developments, seems every company(Apple, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Oracle, etc) are making their own chips for custom use.  I just dont think there is an issue getting chip anymore. The issue is creating the software for actual use of AI and generating cash flow. The 1 year honeymoon period may be over, AI spending needs to start adding to earnings. otherwise its a massive expense for alot of companies of buying the chips and spending a lot of money on electricity to run the machines.

"Nintendo Anysis_2 Comparison";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/193rji9/nintendo_anysis_2_comparison/";"Sorry, I can't upload pictures here.  **Growth**   Nintendo 3 years average growth is 7%, and EPS growth is 20%. The revenue growth is lower compared with its peers, like Play Station and Xbox. The EPS growth is good, but not outstanding, lower than game developers Capcom, Koei Tecmo, and Square Enix. Koei Tecmo and Capcom have delivered impressive growth in the last three years. Play Station and Take-Two achieved high revenue growth but did not drive their profit increase.   From the growth data comparison, I think Nintendo needs new drivers for the next generation. It plans to increase capital investment in IP expansion and initiate more people access to its dedicated game platform, but I think it not be the main driver in the next competition.   **Profit**   Nintendo has good profit margins with a gross margin of 55% and an operating margin of 32%. This is higher than most competitors. Koei Tecmo and Capcom are more attractive, but they don't have a platform. Compared with Sony Play Station and Sega, Nintendo's performance is better. I can't find the margin data of the Gaming business from Microsoft's financial report, so I use the personal segment data, maybe this is not exact.   Although Nintendo has a decline in cash turnover compared with its history, Nintendo did much better than its competitors. Considering its good margins, I think Nintendo has strong profitability and return.   **Returns**   Nintendo has an outstanding investment return of 46% and an equity return of 21% compared with its competitors, especially in investment return. I think this benefited from a great composite of solid margins and a high cash turnover rate.   Again, I use the company's whole business ROE of Microsoft as I can't get the gaming sector number to calculate it. Considering Microsoft's main business is office software and cloud, this ROE number may not be comparable. ROIC is re-calculated by gaming sector data, and so is Sony Gaming & Network business, Nintendo is performing much better in ROIC than Microsoft Xbox and Sony Play Station.    **Capital Structure**   All game companies here have low financial leverage with a leverage ratio below 0.5 except Sony. Nintendo has no debt on the balance sheet and strong solvency ability.    Every company's Debt to EBITDA is below 4, which means their financial is health and has no insolvency risk.   **Valuation & Dividend**   Nintendo has a better valuation compared with its main competitors, after the recent soaring of price, Nintendo's current EV/EBIT is 13.68x, it's a little higher than the median line of 13x. I think Nintendo's valuation is not expensive considering its current solid financial performance in the first half of FY2023 and the potential to open another growth cycle through new console releases.   As a potential new Switch release this year, we can see some clues from its data in history. Nintendo's EV/EBIT was 15.03x and 30.8x in 2006 and 2016, which is the year the new console was released. Of course, I assume Nintendo's next Switch will perform like Wii and Switch, not Wii U. After the new console is released, Nintendo's market cap increased by 2.5x and 1x in the following 2 years, its EV/EBIT is stable and declined little compared with the released year, which means Nintendo delivers rich profit returns after the new console is released. Back today, Nintendo's valuation multiple is lower than in history, but its market role is still strong, and financial performance is solid, this is not a very high risk to bet its good returns on the eve of a new Switch release.   Nintendo has a good dividend payout ratio of around 50% compared with peers, which will define Nintendo as a value stock. I think Nintendo is not very attractive for buy-and-hold investors as it has highly volatile growth and market value, but it's a special opportunity you should consider when it prepares to add fuel to its tank, and you already know it's not too expensive, and has a stable dividend payout.   **Big Three Comparison**   As a game company with hardware and software, Nintendo's main competitors are Sony's Play Station and Microsoft's Xbox. To compare more clearly, I searched some data focusing on the three companies and their gaming business operating results, this can help me get a clear picture to understand the market position of the three companies. As Microsoft's gaming business data is not disclosed too much, the comparison focuses on Sony and Nintendo. All data used from the last quarterly financial report.   From growth data, Play Station has the highest revenue growth but the lowest profit growth, while Nintendo has the highest profit growth and moderates revenue growth. Microsoft has the lowest revenue growth and higher profit growth. I think all three companies perform well, but I prefer Nintendo because it balances well in revenue and profit growth, you can see more growth in revenue can drive higher profit growth. Xbox X & S has bad sales compared with Switch and PS5. Microsoft may release its new console this year and maybe increase some market shares, especially after it acquired Activision Blizzard. But I don't believe this can change the market structure. Maybe Microsoft has another idea to get money from gaming competition, providing cloud technologies and promoting cloud gaming development. You know, Nintendo online playing uses cloud services from Azure.   Play station's revenue was boosted by PS5 sales. Sony finally prepared enough stock to sell in the shop, you can find PS5 in every gaming shop and Costco. Sony's G & N business doing well this year, but its margin is too low compared with the other two. Sony has tonnes of popular IPs and first-party studios, I think it can do better in the gaming market and up its margin.   Moving to hardware and software sales data, Sony has the highest volume sold in console and software which is driven by PS5. Nintendo achieved surprising console sold and solid software titles sold, but I think Switch volume growth will not persist, and Nintendo needs to prepare something to compete with PS5 and the new Xbox. Microsoft's Xbox X & S has walked to the end of its life as the lowest console sold compared with others. I hope to see its new Xbox this year.   For Player and platform member data, Xbox has more active users but I think this is surpassed by Play Station as Sony has said its active users achieved 123m in its CES two days later. Sony currently has bigger subscribers compared with Nintendo Online and Microsoft GPX. Nintendo has 38m subscribers, which is in the middle.    The cumulative console sold data tells me Nintendo is the biggest one in the market, but considering the Switch is a very old console, I decided to add PS4 and Xbox ONE back, after adding, Sony is the biggest one with a total of 157m units sold, and Nintendo is 132m sold, Xbox is still the lowest units sold of 77.6m. The video game market is still dominated by Sony and Nintendo.   **Conclusion**   Nintendo is doing well compared with its competitors with high-quality growth, strong margins, turnover and investment return, lower insolvency risk, and fair valuation. But Nintendo's growth is already showing signs of weakness, and I think the recent growth in Switch is driven by Legend of Zelda Tears of Kingdom. This trend will not persist in the next year without new console or titles, especially at the time the PS5 Slim has been released and the new Xbox coming. Sony and Nintendo have dominated the video gaming world, and from market shares, Sony is even better than Nintendo. But Sony Play Station's low profitability is putting it in the shadow of Nintendo.

"Arm shares spike 24% after chip designer gives strong forecast, says AI is increasing sales";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1alek9u/arm_shares_spike_24_after_chip_designer_gives/";"Arm reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat estimates and gave a strong profit forecast for the current quarter. The shares soared more than 20% in extended trading.  Here’s how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending December:  Revenue: $824 million, vs. $761 million expected  EPS: 29 cents adjusted, vs 25 cents expected.   Arm, whose chip design technology is in nearly every smartphone and many PCs, said it expects earnings per share for the fiscal fourth quarter of between 28 cents and 32 cents on sales of $850 million to $900 million. Analysts expectations earnings of 21 cents per share on sales of $780 million.  The company reported net income of $87 million, or 8 cents per share. Total revenue in the quarter increased 14% from a year earlier.  Arm makes money through royalties, when companies pay for access to build Arm-compatible chips, usually amounting to a small percentage of the final chip price.  Arm said its customers shipped 7.7 billion Arm chips during the September quarter, which is the most recent period which figures are available.  Royalty revenue increased 11% on an annual basis to $470 million. The company said the jump was partially because of a recovery in the smartphone market, as well as increasing sales to automotive companies and cloud providers. Arm said that it expects growth to be driven by royalty revenue.  In recent years, Arm has emphasized its licensing business, selling access to more complete designs that semiconductor companies can take and plug into their planned chips. That process saves chipmakers time and effort, and it’s more lucrative for Arm than simply collecting royalties.  Arm’s license and other revenue was $354 million, up 18% year-over-year. Arm said more companies were choosing to license its CPU designs to run artificial intelligence, and that the company charges higher licensing fees for advanced designs.  Arm, which had been owned by SoftBank, went public in September.

"We Are In A Mania, Negative Post";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14zryzw/we_are_in_a_mania_negative_post/";"I went out of the market in November 2021. Sold everything but 10%. Started buying again in November 2022 and continued until February 2023.   I missed the exact bottom in October, but still - I timed it almost to perfection. So what I say next should not be dismissed with ""haha, he missed the bottom and is mad"". No bro, I am like the bottom's brother. Edit: just wanted to clarify - I was very lucky. I do not believe I am a genius who can time the market.  Jokes aside, the discount rate is at 5,25% and stocks like Microsoft trading at 40 P/E with negative EPS growth TTM. Apple is a bit better at 32. Now, I know P/E is just a smell test. But no one in this world can convince me that Microsoft will start growing EPS at such a high rate to justify such a multiple... And historically speaking, such high discount rates make P/E multiples go down and not expand. As Buffett says ""interest rates are like gravity for stocks"". Yet, the SP500 is not down even 10% from its all time high.  Microsoft is so big, it has already almost maximized its profit margin potential - it is improbable they will grow earnings over 20%/year. Another point for this being a mania.  I have to admit - there are still companies I like a lot at these prices who are still beaten down 40-50% despite being great businesses and doing well. The only reason for this is that their CEOs haven't repeated ""AIAIAIAIIAIAIAIAIAIAIIAIAIAIAIAIIAIAIAIAIAIAIAIAIAIIAIAIAIAIAII"" 50 times in the last earnings call.   Where I thrive is software companies(SaaS mostly). Most of them have doubled or tripled in the last few months based on how many times AI has been repeated. Growth has slowed down, costs have staid the same, yet stock prices have skyrocketed?!?!  This tells me that this part of the market is in another maniac phase. To be clear, I haven't sold anything. It is just that the pool of potential investments that can offer great returns has decreased drastically. Investors' optimism about these stocks is making me really nervous.   Every bit of bad news is dismissed and gets converted into good news. Every bit of good news gets exaggerated by a factor of 100.   Even though this seems like the end stage of a bull market, I am not betting on it. See how negative I am? I am still in the market. Like Peter Lynch has said - it is important to learn to ignore your gut. Had I listened to my gut, I wouldn't have dared to enter the market in Nov 2022.  Take this post for what you will - human psychology study, ramblings of a random investor... I just feel the need from time to time to let these negative thoughts out. It helps me not to act on them. I still think something will break, but I am ignoring these thoughts.  Good luck to everyone, even if you bought Microsoft at 40 P/E. jk lol";"0";"2023-07-14T22:59:39"
"Is Google’s Waymo potential underrated?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b5v744/is_googles_waymo_potential_underrated/";"It seems to me that among the recent Gemini headlines (which I find personally quite overblown, as Meta’s very advanced AI displayed the same flaws, and Microsoft’s Copilot was shown to display some real nonsense as well), people have kind of lost track of the autonomous vehicle business.   Waymo is by far the most advanced technology of all autonomous vehicle companies in existence. I’m not sure if people are fully aware that Waymo already has a commercial driverless taxi service in operation. I haven’t tried it but watched videos and it seems to work amazingly well. People love to nitpick autonomous vehicles and say “oh x and y are not working perfectly well”, but let’s be real, human taxi drivers are far from perfect and the service seems to be working far, far better than the average taxi driver. This week, Waymo received approval to run their commercial service in Los Angeles.   While most carmakers dabble in their own autonomous driving technology, many of them also have collaborations with Waymo. I see real potential for Waymo to become the de facto provider for most carmakers - the way that for years, many parallel charging networks existed, and very suddenly the majority of carmakers signed on to Tesla’s solution as the dominos kept falling one after the other.   With all the news around ChatGPT, most investors seem to use “AI” interchangeably with “chatbot” or more generally “LLM” or “image generation”. But autonomous driving is in fact AI as well.  Google also owns Deepmind which has been at the absolute cutting edge for AI for many years now. I feel like most people overlook this because you can’t just go to Deepmind.com and have a conversation with their AI. But they are doing some incredibly advanced stuff in scientific fields. Monetizing all of that is going to be a different story but I feel that from a technology standpoint, Google is very much doing impressive things:  https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/29/1084061/deepmind-ai-tool-for-new-materials-discovery/amp/  https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-04043-w";"257";"2024-03-04T00:11:54"
"OpenAI researchers warned board of AI breakthrough ahead of CEO ouster";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/181qfdv/openai_researchers_warned_board_of_ai/";"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/22/sam-altmans-ouster-at-openai-precipitated-by-letter-to-board-about-ai-breakthrough-sources-tell-reuters.html  Ahead of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s four days in exile, several staff researchers sent the board of directors a letter warning of a powerful artificial intelligence discovery that they said could threaten humanity, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.  The previously unreported letter and AI algorithm was a catalyst that caused the board to oust Altman, the poster child of generative AI, the two sources said. Before his triumphant return late Tuesday, more than 700 employees had threatened to quit and join backer Microsoft in solidarity with their fired leader. The sources cited the letter as one factor among a longer list of grievances by the board that led to Altman’s firing. Reuters was unable to review a copy of the letter. The researchers who wrote the letter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  OpenAI declined to comment.  According to one of the sources, long-time executive Mira Murati mentioned the project, called Q*, to employees on Wednesday and said that a letter was sent to the board prior to this weekend’s events.  After the story was published, an OpenAI spokesperson said Murati told employees what the media reports were about but she did not comment on the accuracy of the information.  The maker of ChatGPT had made progress on Q* (pronounced Q-Star), which some internally believe could be a breakthrough in the startup’s search for superintelligence, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), one of the people told Reuters. OpenAI defines AGI as AI systems that are smarter than humans.  Given vast computing resources, the new model was able to solve certain mathematical problems, the person said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the company. Though only performing math on the level of grade-school students, acing such tests made researchers very optimistic about Q*’s future success, the source said. Reuters could not independently verify the capabilities of Q* claimed by the researchers.";"459";"2023-11-23T03:14:56"

Any good suggestions for starting places to learn?   I pulled our 401k's (2040 target) in November 2022. Started with $90k in Amazon and then started liquidating other 401k's (we're in tech and switch jobs every couple/few years). I continued investing in everything AI adjacent, including Nvidia, palantir, c3, meta (wife worked there), Microsoft, AMD, super micro (didn't get in on this until this mid Feb), and a few others. I bought Amazon because I think they're future looks bright and didn't see it performing worse than the 2040 fund and then I basically just kept buying stocks related to AI.  Long story short, pulling out of those dog poop funds was the best financial decision I ever made.   We're not touching any of these stocks for at least 15 years (even the ones in our brokerage account) because 1) we're 50ish and 2) I look at companies like Microsoft where even if you had invested at the top of the dot.com bubble, if you hadn't touched i the stock, you'd still be in great shape despite major market downtowns along the way.   Now having said all that, I look at this portfolio every day, and aside from a couple company's earnings calls, it looks to my untrained eye that it's a lot of speculation based on a collective assumption of future growth in AI and that I just got in early.   I know this is a stretch to ask on Reddit, but even with these 1-5% daily gains that I think are coming from people and institutions still racing to get their money into AI, what is triggering declines like today (-.2.5%)? Is it large blocks of money taking profits out, or people selling because they have set up some kind of triggers to get ahead of a declining market, or a million other things (most likely)?  Even though I don't plan on ""day trading"", I'd like to learn more about what's causing these ebbs and flows of money and I don't feel like anything on TV (and most of the ""shows"" on the Internet) give us an unbiased view of what's really going on. Any suggestions of where to start learning?  Thanks!";"0";"2024-03-05T21:38:19"
"Netflix ad-supported tier has 40 million subscribers ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cst7bq/netflix_adsupported_tier_has_40_million/";"Netflix’s cheaper, ad-supported tier has amassed 40 million global monthly active users, the company said Wednesday.  That’s nearly double the 23 million figure the streaming giant shared in January.  Separately, Netflix announced it would launch its own advertising platform and no longer partner with Microsoft for that technology. The tech giant will remain a programmatic advertising partner.  Netflix introduced the ad-supported plan in November 2022 as part of a wider effort to drive revenue amid slowing subscriber growth. That strategy included last year’s password-sharing crackdown.  The company said Wednesday that 40% of all signups in countries that have the ad tier available are for that cheaper plan. Netflix now has 270 million total subscribers.  The monthly active ad-tier user figures come just a month after Netflix told investors it would no longer be providing quarterly subscriber number updates. The company said at the time that it was generating substantial profit and free cash flow and that its membership numbers were not the only factor in the company’s growth. It said the metric lost significance after it started to offer multiple price points for memberships.  The surge in ad-tier users comes as linear TV audiences shrink and traditional media companies seek to gain a foothold in the streaming realm. Netflix has established itself as the leader in the segment as many other companies struggle to make their streaming platforms profitable.  Key competitors have far fewer subscribers than Netflix does. In its first-quarter earnings report, Comcast said its streaming platform Peacock had 34 million subscribers.

Artificial intelligence has been one of the defining themes for stocks in 2023 – and it's also helping the rich get richer.      The surge in interest in the intelligent language tool ChatGPT quickly spread across markets, with big-name investors rushing to snap up shares in companies they believe could power AI's rise to prominence.      Big Tech giants like Meta Platforms and Nvidia have already racked up triple-digit gains thanks to the AI boom, while Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, and Oracle have also all surged.      That's helped the companies' founders – already among the world's richest people at the start of 2023 – to become even wealthier.  Meta shares have rallied 134% year-to-date thanks to both the rise of AI and Zuckerberg's so-called ""year of efficiency"" cost cuts, and that's lifted the Facebook founder's wealth by over $57 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.      Meanwhile, Oracle founder Larry Ellison passed Bill Gates on the publication's rich list for the first time ever earlier this week, with his fortune up $47 billion in 2023 thanks to the tech stock's 55% gain.      Gates himself has gotten $24 billion richer this year thanks to his Microsoft shares, with the Redmond-based tech giant emerging as a preferred AI play for billionaire investors including Stanley Druckenmiller.      And the man at the helm of one of the stock market's biggest success story of 2023 – Nvidia founder Jensen Huang – has also seen his personal fortune balloon by $24 billion, according to Bloomberg's index.  Again, that's largely thanks to Huang's shares in the chipmaker, which have jumped 192% in value to lift the company to a $1 trillion market capitalization.      The members of the rich list have seen their combined wealth jump by over $150 billion in 2023, by Insider's calculations.";"175";"2023-06-20T08:06:37"

"Apple nears deal with OpenAI to power upcoming iPhone features with ChatGPT, says Bloomberg";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cp6s0v/apple_nears_deal_with_openai_to_power_upcoming/";"After talking with both OpenAI and Google about their AI models, Apple is nearing a deal to partner with OpenAI and leverage ChatGPT for upcoming iPhone features, reports Bloomberg. We can expect to see the workings of both companies as soon as next month, during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).  According to Mark Gurman, who spoke with ""people familiar with the matter,"" Apple first renewed talks with OpenAI to use the startup's tech to power new AI features coming to future iPhones, and is now nearing a formal partnership.   This comes shortly after Apple was reportedly in talks with Google to license Gemini for various iPhone services. ""Those discussions haven't led to an agreement, but are ongoing,"" says Gurman.  The news comes shortly after OpenAI announced it would be unveiling new ChatGPT features this upcoming Monday, a day before Google I/O. Talks between the Microsoft-backed AI company and Apple were apparently pretty far along, Bloomberg previously reported, as discussions of an agreement had occurred for some time.  While Apple has plenty of researchers working on the company's own AI models, those don't seem quite ready to be the star of the show, so the company has been looking for outside help.  The next big iPhone update, iOS 18, will most likely be announced during WWDC on June 10. With Apple nearing a deal with OpenAI, we may see some familiar ChatGPT capabilities integrated across popular iOS features like iMessage, FaceTime, and, of course, Siri.  It's worth pointing out that OpenAI's ChatGPT app came to the iPhone about two months before landing on Android. Apple hasn't officially announced any AI features for the iPhone, but if you look at the Pixel 8 Pro or the Galaxy S24, you can get an idea of what the new features might be: generative AI photo editing, transcription of voice memos, webpage summarization, text generation, custom wallpapers, and so on.  There aren't any details about what iPhone models the new AI might be available on, but if Apple follows its competitors, the features will likely debut on the newest flagship and slowly trickle down to other models.

Discovery CEO David Zaslav met with Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish on Tuesday in New York City to discuss a possible merger, Axios has learned from multiple sources. Why it matters: The combination would create a news and entertainment behemoth that would likely trigger further industry consolidation.  - Zaslav also has spoken to Shari Redstone, who owns Paramount's parent company, about a deal.  - WBD's market value was around $29 billion as of Wednesday, while Paramount's was just over $10 billion, so any merger would not be of equals.  Details: The meeting between Zaslav and Bakish, which sources say lasted several hours, took place at Paramount's headquarters in Times Square.  - The duo discussed ways their companies could compliment one another. For example, each company's main streaming service — Paramount+ and Max — could merge to better rival Netflix and Disney+.  - It's unclear whether WBD would buy Paramount Global or its parent company, National Amusements Inc. (NAI), but a source familiar with the situation says that both options are on the table.  - WBD is said to have hired bankers to explore the deal.  Between the lines: The deal could drive substantial synergies. WBD could use its international distribution footprint to boost Paramount's franchises, while Paramount's children's programing assets could be essential to WBD's long-term streaming ambitions.  - CBS News could be combined with CNN to create a global news powerhouse. CBS' crime dramas, such as ""NCIS"" and ""Criminal Minds,"" could be combined with Investigation Discovery and TruTV.  - CBS Sports' footprint could be combined with WBD's. For example, CBS and WBD's Turner Sports currently share TV rights for March Madness.  Be smart: Paramount is under enormous pressure to find a strategic partner or buyer, as it's staring down a mountain of debt.";"294";"2023-12-20T22:16:28"

We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens.      It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark.   No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space.      First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently?      You could say it’s because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood.   It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT.      AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks.      How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype?   Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it’s not just any Product. It’s a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.   An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand.      This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).      This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW.      They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party.      How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else.      Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts:      \- Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees      \- Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to)      \- Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development)      \- Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers      The Analogy:      „Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood).      TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees.      The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.      At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture.      Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.      Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market.      What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process.      Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“      \----      NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips.      Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that’s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn’t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture.      NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them.      Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC.   TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple.      So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them.      There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.      So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel.   Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD?   This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design.      Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough.      AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips.      Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again.      According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.      Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?!      Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so:      „However, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration.      Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple’s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.“ (Does Apple use Nvidia? (ts2.com.pl)      Because you are all regarded, here are the links where major companies have declared that they will design their own chips:      Microsoft: Microsoft is finally making custom chips — and they’re all about AI - The Verge      Meta: Exclusive: Meta to deploy in-house custom chips this year to power AI drive - memo | Reuters      Google: Google Training Gemini On Its Own Chips Reveals Another Of Its Advantages (forbes.com)      ChatGPT: Exclusive: ChatGPT-owner OpenAI is exploring making its own AI chips | Reuters      In the meantime, Meta and Microsoft say they will buy AMDS new AI Chip as an alternative to Nvidia: Meta and Microsoft to buy AMD's new AI chip as alternative to Nvidia (cnbc.com)      Since I feel so validated by the links above, I'll stop writing my DD, which would have additionally dealt with NVIDIA's past as a company (acquisitions) and the tricks to gain advantage in the consumer graphics card market (Raytracing, PhysiX).";"5";"2024-02-16T19:18:36"
"Apple hit with more than $1.95 billion EU antitrust fine over music streaming";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b6agqo/apple_hit_with_more_than_195_billion_eu_antitrust/";"The European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, on Monday hit Apple with a 1.8 billion euro ($1.95 billion) antitrust fine for abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.  The Commission said it found that Apple had applied restrictions on app developers that prevented them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app.  Apple also banned developers of music streaming apps from providing any instructions about how users could subscribe to these cheaper offers, the Commission alleged.  This is Apple’s first antitrust fine from Brussels and is among one of the biggest dished out to a technology company by the EU.  The European Commission opened an investigation into Apple after a complaint from Spotify in 2019. The probe was narrowed down to focus on contractual restrictions that Apple imposed on app developers which prevent them from informing iPhone and iPad users of alternative music subscription services at lower prices outside of the App Store.  Apple’s conduct lasted almost 10 years, according to the Commission, and “may have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions because of the high commission fee imposed by Apple on developers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher subscription prices for the same service on the Apple App Store.”  Apple response:  In a fiery response to the fine, Apple said Spotify would stand to gain the most from the EU pronouncement.  “The primary advocate for this decision — and the biggest beneficiary — is Spotify, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. Spotify has the largest music streaming app in the world, and has met with the European Commission more than 65 times during this investigation,” Apple said in a statement.  “Today, Spotify has a 56 percent share of Europe’s music streaming market — more than double their closest competitor’s — and pays Apple nothing for the services that have helped make them one of the most recognisable brands in the world.”  Apple said that a “large part” of Spotify’s success is thanks to the Cupertino giant’s App Store, “along with all the tools and technology that Spotify uses to build, update, and share their app with Apple users around the world.”  Apple said that Spotify pays it nothing. That’s because instead of selling subscriptions in their iOS app, Spotify sell them via their own website stead. Apple does not collect a commission on those purchases.  Developers over the years have spoken out against the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.  Spotify did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.  The fine will ramp up tensions between Big Tech and Brussels at a time when the EU is increasing scrutiny of these firms.  Last year, the Commission designated Apple among other tech firms like Microsoft and Meta as “gatekeepers” under a landmark regulation called the Digital Markets Act, which broadly came into effect last year.  The term gatekeepers refers to massive internet platforms which the EU believes are restricting access to core platform services, such as online search, advertising, and messaging and communications.  The Digital Markets Act aims to clamp down on anti-competitive practices from tech players, and force them to open out some of their services to other competitors. Smaller internet firms and other businesses have complained about being hurt by these companies’ business practices.  These laws have already had an impact on Apple. The Cupertino, California-based giant announced plans this year to open up its iPhone and iPad to alternative app stores other than its own. Developers have long-complained about the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.

"Short sellers are betting more than $1 trillion against US stocks after big run";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14hpvg1/short_sellers_are_betting_more_than_1_trillion/";"* Total US short interest exceeded $1 trillion as of last Friday, S3 Partners data shows. * The top five shorts are mega-cap tech stocks Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon * That comes after big stock market gains so far this year.  US short interest this month rose to the highest level since April 2022, as investors bet that the current bull run in the stock market is set to falter.  According to data from S3 Partners, the amount spent by short sellers against US stocks hit $1.02 trillion, as of Friday. Those bets came even as they continued to rally earlier this month, costing short sellers $101 billion.  S3 data shows that the top shorts are Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. As of Friday, their collective short interest topped $83 billion.  The bearish sentiment results from skepticism about how much higher stocks can go. So far this year, the S&P 500 is up 13.5%, and the Nasdaq is up 29%.  But since the Federal Reserve last week indicated more rate hikes are on the table this year, stocks have been on a losing streak.  This year, Wall Street has been caught up in the hype over artificial intelligence companies, which saw their valuations skyrocket and have brought more investors into the market due to ""fear of missing out.""  But big names have voiced divided outlooks on the AI frenzy. For instance, while Stanley Druckenmiller sees Nvidia as a stock worth holding for the next couple of years, short seller Jim Chanos has demonstrated skepticism towards the stock.  Meanwhile, the prospect of continued hawkishness from the Fed has added to macroeconomic risks. A recent Goldman Sachs report put the odds of a recession in the next 12 months at 25% and warned a downturn could cause a 23% decline in the S&P 500.  Still, if bullish investors win out, short positions could eventually support market gains, as a short squeeze forces more buying and boosts stocks.";"0";"2023-06-24T12:48:34"
"Why Apple simply doesn't provide a cloud service?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bbz8zd/why_apple_simply_doesnt_provide_a_cloud_service/";"With AAPL growing now at what I consider to be a  ""GDP premium rate"" ~ 5% and with the iphone growth slowing down, what is left now for Apple is to capitalize on its services. This is now under attack in the EU. I am not a financial specialist but as a European I do however foresee a hard time for Apple to grow services revenue in the EU. Now that Apple has to offer search choices, that revenue with Google might also see some decline. With the self-driving car cancelled, it is hard to picture any sectors where Apple could still push double digit growth. VisionPro? too expensive at the moment, it would still to be at least in the $1000 range for the mass. While we have seen positive news on the tech, it is still unknown how many people who bought the device hasn't yet returned it.  GenAI? They reshuffled the entire team working on Titan to focus on GenAI. How is that possible? are the skills really transferable? Vision Problem != LLM but again not an expert.  This led me to wonder, why isn't Apple competing in the cloud business? I don't mean like AWS or Azure but for its developers? When a developer onboard on IOS, they make use of the store and the SDK but all cloud services the app uses is running somewhere else. Wouldn't Apple be able to justify 30%+ cut of the developer's revenue if part of the deal was access to Apple cloud infrastructure to run the App services?  Do you guys think this is far fetched? What other sectors do you guys think Apple can still tap in to to go back to double digit growth?  Leadership wise, i am a bit split. Post Steve Jobs, all they had truly done was innovate on the iPhone and in a way that phone was conceptualized during Steve's time. So what exactly did Tim Cook do? I would still pick Tim Cook over Sundar but he is not Satya who was more of an opportunist that turned Microsoft around.  Anyway, lots of questions and a bit of a rant.

One of the **selling features** is that your eyes are visible, but the headset will conceal your eyes when you're fully immersed in an app.. which may or may not be groundbreaking as it didn't perfectly reveal your eyes (perhaps because there wasn't enough lighting inside the goggles to show your eyes clearly, but I think this could be fixed w/ software or by adding LED lights on the inside edges), however:  * If you can keep your headset on while talking to people in the room compared to the competition, this feature alone would win out  Price tag is $3500, but again this is the dev conference, so the consumer version of this product will come later, although I can see how a lot of developers might want to buy this thing (also consider that Apple has the largest developer network) compared to competitor headsets which cost 7x less (META is coming out with a $500 VR headset).  Something to note, the stock dropped nearly 1.5% during all the free features (before the VR headset) that were going to be included to existing users, however that did coincide with the market indexes dropping as well.

AMD added that it expected all of its major businesses, including server and PC chips, to decline sequentially during the quarter.  Net income in the fourth quarter was $667 million, or $0.41 per share, versus $21 million, or $0.01 per share a year ago.  AMD makes graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are needed to train and deploy generative artificial intelligence models. While that market is currently dominated by Nvidia, AMD has said that its new AI chips introduced last year will challenge Nvidia’s H100 GPUs for some applications, and investors are looking for significant growth in the company’s data center segment over the next few years.  In October, AMD said it expected $2 billion in server GPU sales in 2024.  But historically, AMD’s main business has been central processors, or CPUs, for PCs and servers. Compared to AI chips, that part of the semiconductor industry has been flat or shrinking over the past few years, as PC sales have suffered post-pandemic.  Data center, which includes server CPUs and AI chips, rose 38% on an annual basis to $2.28 billion in sales. It’s now firmly AMD’s largest business and the company said that much of the increase in revenue was attributable to “strong growth” for sales of its Instinct graphics processors, which are used for AI.  However, AMD’s overall performance in the business was in line with a $2.29 billion FactSet estimates for the Data Center business.  AMD’s client group, which is comprised mostly of chips for PCs and laptops, rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.  Sales in AMD’s gaming segment, which includes “semi-custom” processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a “significant” double-digit percentage in the current quarter.

In addition to Zoom, cloud software vendor Okta  announced a downsizing on Thursday, telling employees that it’s laying off 400 staffers, or about 7% of its workforce.  Zoom exploded in popularity at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as workers turned to the video-conferencing platform to stay in touch with colleagues, friends and family. But as the pandemic subsided and many workers returned to in-person roles, Zoom’s stock has stumbled.  Zoom shares are down about 10% this year and have dropped almost 90% from their record high in October 2020.  Last February, Zoom cut around 1,300 workers, or about 15% of its workforce, as the company braced for the “uncertainty of the global economy,” CEO Eric Yuan said at the time. The cuts in 2023 hit every organization across Zoom.  Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/01/zoom-layoffs-company-cuts-150-employees-2percent-of-workforce.html";"242";"2024-02-01T22:23:46"

I have been operating a business the past 6 years and have about $500k in a high-yield savings account.  I held more cash than I think I would have liked to because I wanted to reinvest in the business and potentially try some new ideas.    &#x200B:  Nonetheless I am sitting on post-tax cash of $500k.  I already have $335k in 401(k) with 100% in VTI.  Although the Marcus high yield savings is great I feel like I am sitting on way too much cash. Ideally I want to hold at least $150k so I have runway for business for the next year or two.     Obviously all of us wish we had thrown a large brick of cash into tech stocks, etc. at the end of 2022 - trying not to let that sting but it definitely is hard feeling like I could have just thrown money into stocks and not had to work so hard building a business - hindsight bias is a bitch lol.  I am grateful to be in this position but still feel like I have totally missed the boat.  &#x200B:  I am thinking about putting like $300k into Google, Amazon and Microsoft because I feel that cloud computing and AI are only going to become more popular.  I use AWS a lot and see almost all of my clients using AWS.  Also maybe Apple just because they have a really good moat.  &#x200B:  Bottom line is should I just throw excess capital into tech stocks, put it all in VTI or do something else?  I calculate if I just do VTI and chill it will be worth like $5M later but I am like...AI is going to change earth, needs significant compute from the cloud and even though I missed the 2023 runup in tech it feels like there is still a lot of growth left.  My goal is to get as rich as possible as young as possible, ideally without having to wait to 59.5 years old to withdraw.  &#x200B:  I feel extremely confused about what to do next and financial advisors I talk to all seem to honestly have no idea what to do either.

"Bought my first individual stock today.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17ztgcw/bought_my_first_individual_stock_today/";"I bought MSFT around 10:30am, which I plan to hold for a long time.   It's already gone up 1%, not that it won't go down again.  It will be fun to watch.  I hope this kind of post is okay.  I'm just excited.  (Up until today its all been in managed accounts.  This was an impulse buy driven by my personal interest (AI), so I hope this wasn't too irrational of a purchase.  Technically I had some MSFT in my managed account, but this was the first time I bought on my own, separately.  I'm usually too much of a chicken to buy stocks.  This is less than 1% of my total.)  ----  UPDATE: Since I'm getting some salty and sarcastic comments, I'll explain my thinking, although it'll likely attract more saltiness:  I'm gambling Microsoft will become the leader in AI given what's happened in the last 24 hours. OpenAI's loss of staff (up to 70%!) and leadership will cause it to go into permanent stagnation and lose its lead (unless they pull off some miracle this week).   MSFT is perfectly positioned to take over OpenAI's near monopoly on consumer AI in less than a year. They already know how to operate OpenAI's hardware infrastructure and have poached many of OpenAI's employees and leadership.  AI is the ""next big thing"", as big as the PC, the Internet, or the iPhone, and AGI, in whenever year it comes, will be even bigger.  AI hasn't fully saturated all domains, yet, so the full impact hasn't been felt by most people or industries... yet.  People are commenting, ""but it's at ATH"", which is true.  AAPL was at an all time high in late 2006 (if I have the timing right), and then the iPhone happened.  And all that said, this is 1% of my portfolio.  Calm down.  This was for fun.  I was hoping this would be a friendly community.  edit: removed how many shares I bought as it bothered some people.";"56";"2023-11-20T18:13:05"

"Dell surges 9% on optimism it has secured big AI server orders ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cst8qv/dell_surges_9_on_optimism_it_has_secured_big_ai/";"Dell shares rose more than 9% on Wednesday to an all-time high after Morgan Stanley raised its price target and predicted that the company would rake in sales from the insatiable demand for artificial intelligence servers.  Dell is seeing accelerating momentum, especially in winning business to build AI servers, unlocking a new bull case for the stock, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note on Wednesday. He upgraded his price target on Dell from $128 per share to $152 a share and called it a top pick.  “All-in, we are hearing about more AI server momentum at Dell than at any other OEM,” Woodring wrote, saying that he expected about $10 billion of AI server revenue in the company’s fiscal 2025 — ending next February.  Wednesday’s move was the largest since March 1, when the stock surged after earnings showed that the computer manufacturer has benefited from the AI boom.  Dell shares are now up over 95% in 2024, trailing the 220% gain from rival AI servermaker Super Micro Computer but surpassing Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s 5% gains this year.  Most AI servers are built around Nvidia’s chips, which have become prized in the technology industry because they are used to deploy advanced AI models from companies like Google, OpenAI and Meta. Dell sells servers using the newest Nvidia AI chips, including its H100 GPU and the latest Blackwell-generation chips.  At Nvidia’s annual conference in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang appeared to send customers who want the latest AI chips to Dell for orders.  “You’re going to need an AI factory,” Huang said. “And nobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell.”  “Michael [Dell] is here and he’s happy to take your order,” Huang continued.  “While the near-exponential ramp of Nvidia GPU shipments and AI servers builds make it difficult to pin down exact growth rates,” Woodring wrote, he has confidence in Dell’s business for various reasons. Among those reasons are the strengthening demand for AI servers and that he models Dell’s market share increasing.  He wrote that Dell may be able to upsell its customers and “attach” additional hardware, such as data storage.  Dell is expected to announce its April quarter earnings on May 30. Nvidia reports earnings for its quarter ending in April on May 22.  Dell’s other business, building PCs for consumers and businesses running Microsoft Windows, could get a boost next week when Microsoft reveals new capabilities at its conference, including long-awaited AI features that many analysts expect to drive demand for new PCs.  PC sales have slumped for two years in a post-pandemic hangover, as consumers and enterprises who bought new machines during 2020 and 2021 pushed back the timeline for their next upgrades.  But the PC industry is on course to grow again and is outperforming lowered expectations, Woodring wrote, which will benefit Dell.  “We remain bullish on the PC market recovery as we are not only hearing about upgrade/refresh demand in our recent CIO and VAR checks, but also seeing upward revisions to notebook ODM builds in recent months,” Woodring wrote.

"Cisco cutting 5% of global workforce in restructuring move";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aqy1qd/cisco_cutting_5_of_global_workforce_in/";"Cisco announced plans to cut 5% of its workforce on Wednesday, a decision that will result in the elimination of about 4,250 jobs. Shares were down 4% in extended trading.  It’s the latest tech company to downsize in 2024, as the industry continues to squeeze out costs following the market downturn that hit two years ago. January was the busiest month for job cuts in the industry since March, as Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and SAP all said they were eliminating positions, as did eBay Unity and Discord. So far this year, 144 tech companies have laid off almost 35,000 workers, according to the website Layoffs.fyi.  In addition to disclosing the job cuts, Cisco reported strong fiscal second-quarter results but gave a light forecast. Here’s how it did in comparison with the consensus from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:  Earnings per share: 87 cents, adjusted, vs. 84 cents expected  Revenue: $12.79 billion, vs. $12.71 billion expected  Cisco’s revenue declined 6% year over year during the quarter, which ended on Jan. 27, according to a statement. Net income declined to $2.63 billion, or 65 cents per share, from $2.77 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.  Revenue from networking products totaled $7.08 billion, slightly below the $7.10 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.  With respect to guidance, Cisco called for 84 to 86 cents per share on $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for 92 cents per share on $13.09 billion in revenue.  For the full year, Cisco sees $3.68 to $3.74 in adjusted earnings per share and $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion in revenue. Analysts had projected $3.86 in adjusted earnings per share, with $54.26 billion in revenue.

In the week through Jan. 30, a ratio of bulls to bears identified in an Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers hit its highest since around mid-2021, months before stocks neared their prior peak, Yardeni Research analysis shows.*  *“There’s a ‘rah-rah’ mob mentality in the stock market, with some traders drunk on their own wine,” betting on Fed easing as soon as March and upwards of six cuts this year, said Nick Giacoumakis, president of NEIRG Wealth Management. “That’s totally unrealistic. If you keep buying Big Tech stocks at these levels, you’re asking for trouble.”*  *This month is off to a banner start, with the market wrapping up its 13th gain in 14 weeks. The S&P 500 hasn’t seen a streak like that since 1986.*  *Solid earnings from Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. drove the strength at the end of last week, after Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. released results that fell sort of investor expectations on AI.*  *February has a tendency to start on a high note, although the strength typically fades around mid-month as investors book profits, according to Jeffrey Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader’s Almanac. That’s particularly the case if stocks get a boost in January — like they often do — following tax-loss harvesting in December.*  *For the skittish camp, the latest signals from the Fed are a source of angst.*  *Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested last week that the central bank wasn’t about to lower rates anytime soon, and that was before Friday’s blockbuster jobs report. After that data, swaps traders chopped the probability of a March rate cut to around 20%, and no longer see a May reduction as a done deal.*  *For some would-be dip-buyers, that raises red flags, especially with the latest Deutsche Bank AG data showing that aggregate equity positioning among rules-based and discretionary funds is in the top quarter of observations going back to 2010. The bullish skew raises questions over who’s left to buy after fund managers piled into stocks at a furious pace in November, December and January.*  *“I really hope we get a correction in the stock market soon,” said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. “A selloff may not feel good at first, but I have a lot of money that I want to put to work for my clients.”*  *She plans to use any pullback to add shares of Palo Alto Networks Inc., Microsoft and Amazon.*  *At NEIRG Wealth, Giacoumakis said he owns megacap tech stocks, which have driven the bulk of the market’s advance over the past year, but he isn’t adding to his position due to lofty valuations.*  *Members of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies, the biggest firms in the S&P 500 — Apple Inc., Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. — carry a 33% premium to the index in terms of forward price-to-earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show.*  *Of course, sentiment can stay frothy for weeks — even months — before stocks suffer a significant drop, notes Hirsch at the Stock Trader’s Almanac, who correctly called the S&P 500’s double-digit rise in 2023.*  *Take 2021, he said: Back then, the ratio of bulls to bears in the Investors Intelligence survey was hovering at current levels for most of that year, while equities continued to rip higher.*  *“Stocks are ripe for a pullback soon, but nothing sinister,” said Hirsch, who sees the S&P 500 potentially topping 5,000 this month before retreating to its prior high near 4,800 — or a 4% drop.*  *“Market breadth is already lacking right now, with fewer stocks participating in this rally.”*";"38";"2024-02-09T19:49:32"
"iPhone sales slow down: Apple to see sharpest fall in revenue since 2016 as analysts stress on AI to boost growth";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15fv0st/iphone_sales_slow_down_apple_to_see_sharpest_fall/";"Apple is expected to witness a decline in iPhone sales during the April-June quarter, attributed to cautious consumer behaviour in a slow economy as the launch of a new model is anticipated. As the tech giant prepares to release its earnings report, analysts emphasise the significance of revealing its utilisation of artificial intelligence (AI) to boost growth.  Apple, the world's most valuable company, is projected to experience a 1.6% dip in total quarterly revenue, which would mark its sharpest decrease in third-quarter revenue since 2016, according to Refinitiv. Specifically, iPhone sales are anticipated to have declined by over 2% during this period, based on a survey of 24 analysts conducted by Visible Alpha. This contrasts with a nearly 3% increase in sales during the same quarter last year and a 1.5% rise in the preceding quarter (January-March).  The upcoming quarterly report may serve as a deviation from the positive earnings trend observed in other prominent tech companies such as Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Microsoft. These companies have demonstrated resilience in their cloud-based operations and have witnessed a surge in digital ad sales. ""Apple is not immune to general macroeconomic trends and will continue to set the pace (for the smartphone industry) for quite some time,"" Reuters quoted Bob O'Donnell, founder of TECHnalysis Research, as saying. In September, analysts anticipate the unveiling of the much-anticipated iPhone 15, which could feature the widely accepted USB-C port on certain models. This development may provide a slight boost to iPhone sales during the July-September quarter, according to market experts, who have differing opinions on the overall performance during this period.  Notably, Apple has a tradition of not providing quarterly outlooks. However, industry analysts speculate that the tech giant might shed light on its utilisation of AI to enhance the upcoming product lineup, offering insights into the company's innovative approach.";"123";"2023-08-02T03:27:57"
"ATH | Leverage | Index Funds and more";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17p3jmo/ath_leverage_index_funds_and_more/";"I got a few questions as a newbie  &#x200B:  1. Some of the companies I want to invest long-term are either at their ATH or close to ATH, like Microsoft  or Nvidia. I'm wondering whether I should wait for it to drop, because most of the stock market is green this year, so I have a feeling it may drop since it grew so much, what do you think? Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy 2. Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? 3. Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow?  4. Stock Math  - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back? Logically the first answer, but something doesn't give me a peace of mind here, so I prefer to ask 5. Eli Lilly - what do you think about this stock? Growed massive amount lately, and pharmaceutical industry will definitely be there in 5 or 10 years.";"0";"2023-11-06T15:09:30"

On Thursday, the semiconductor company launched a new lineup of laptop processors named “Core Ultra,” which are designed to enhance AI-related features in PC software applications.  “The launch of Intel Core Ultra represents the unmatched scale and speed at which Intel is enabling AI on the PC,” Michelle Johnston Holthaus, Intel’s general manager of Client Computing Group said in a news release. “Intel is best-positioned to deliver this next generation of computing.”      The executive predicts AI PCs, which have capabilities to accelerate AI workloads, will account for 80% of the PC market over the next four years. The chip maker also said more than 100 software vendors have optimized their applications with AI-related features that take advantage of Core Ultra.  Starting Thursday, computers with the Core Ultra chips are available worldwide from leading PC makers, including Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Microsoft and Samsung      Intel also launched its latest server processors—the fifth-generation Intel Xeon chips.      “Designed for AI, our 5th Gen Intel Xeon processors provide greater performance to customers deploying AI capabilities across cloud,” Intel general manager of Data Center and AI Group Sandra Rivera said in a separate release.

"TECH China’s new guidelines block Intel and AMD chips in government computers: FT";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bnepfo/tech_chinas_new_guidelines_block_intel_and_amd/";"China has rolled out new guidelines that will phase out U.S. processors in government computers and servers, effectively blocking chips from Inteland AMD, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.  The procurement guidelines, unveiled on Dec. 26, are now being enforced and will also impact Microsoft’s Windows operating system and foreign-made database software as they favor Chinese alternatives, the report said. Government agencies higher the township level have been ordered to purchase “safe and reliable” processors and operating systems, FT said. AMD and Intel declined to comment on the report.   This comes as China has been boosting its domestic semiconductor industry as it seeks to reduce reliance on foreign technology. Semiconductors – critical components found in a wide range of devices from smartphones to medical equipment – have been at the center of a technology war between the U.S. and China.  U.S. has implemented export restrictions to cut off Beijing from key semiconductor equipment and technologies. In October 2022, Washington introduced rules aimed at restricting China’s ability to access, obtain or manufacture advanced semiconductor chips amid concerns that China could use them for military purposes. The U.S. then rolled out new regulations in October 2023 to prevent U.S. chip design firm Nvidia from selling advanced AI chips to China.   Since 2019, Chinese tech companies such as Huawei and China’s biggest chipmaker SMIC have been slapped with sanctions by the U.S. aimed at restricting their access to advanced technology. SMIC has also been unable to obtain extreme ultraviolet lithography machines critical for the making of advanced chips from firm ASML. The U.S.-led tech embargo has helped boost revenues at China’s domestic chip equipment manufacturing firms. China’s top 10 equipment makers reported revenue rose 39% in the first half of 2023 as compared to a year ago, according to Shanghai-based CINNO Research.

"IBM, what's not to like?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15o9uyn/ibm_whats_not_to_like/";"Though the company has not experienced the same Bull run from the current AI hype, IBM in my opinion is not a poor hold. To be honest, in addition to its track-record as dividend atistocrat there is enough deep value locked in its business to make it a more than decent stock to hold for the long-term. IBM has shown its ability to adapt and pivot when industries and demand changes. In this respect, it has shown to stay relevant in contemporary times.  Sure if you do a deep dive in its management, cash flow operations and product/service offerings there are arguments that might paint a different picture. Moreover, why invest in a company that does not have the same sex appeal as Microsoft, Oracle or Google and is underperforming if looked at these competitors. Even the current PE (over 60) could indicate that in IBM is at best fairly priced. So why even bother to give it a second glance.   Well, IBM, the ugly ducklin compared to its peers, is about to become a Swan again. Looking at the growth potential of its AI business, there are significant indicators that it will see value grow in the mid-long term. Apart from AI, the consultancy division also have potential for future growth. I would even argue that the risk of owning IBM stock is mitigated by its strong record of dividend payments. This makes it an asset that will provide sufficient cash-flow.   Though I am not claiming that its stock will see a 2 ot 3 x in growth (I do not see this happening), I am willing to bet that it will beat the S&P 500.   What are your thoughts?

"Google parent Alphabet’s stock hit with two downgrades this week";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14l5hf7/google_parent_alphabets_stock_hit_with_two/";"In his research note, Shmulik said Alphabet’s “narrative has caught up with the fundamentals.” In other words, the stock is priced to match the company’s current performance and outlook. He also raised concerns about the way market sentiment went negative on the company after OpenAI announced ChatGPT in Nov. 2022 only to turn positive when the tech titan debuted its own generative AI software in May.      “What do we imagine would happen then, in any of the next 2-4 quarters, if Google Search numbers were to come in 'soft'? We imagine investors may once again ring the alarm bells around AI-related risks to Google's Search moat,” Shmulik wrote.  The analysts also pointed to Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) as a potential headwind for the company’s search advertising business. SGE is Google’s experimental generative AI-powered search platform. Like Microsoft’s Bing, it uses generative AI to provide users with answers to specific queries. The problem, the analysts say, is that the generative AI responses occupy screen space that is currently used to serve ads on the normal Google Search page.  “We recognize that \[Google’s\] SGE roll-out is still in its very early stages (limited beta in the US only), with the integration of ads still being figured out,” Walmsley wrote in a research note. “But our initial testing of SGE shows material changes to \[search engine results page\] vs. the ‘old’ Google…which we see as demonstrative of the potential disruption to Google's well-oiled Search monetization machine.”      Google is also increasingly facing challenges from the likes of Meta and Amazon in the digital advertising space. TikTok is also quickly playing a larger role in the industry. Increased spending on generative AI technologies could also cut into Alphabet’s margins.      The company is also staring down a slew of regulatory challenges including calls by the European Union’s European Commission to break up Google’s massive advertising business, which the commission says violates antitrust laws.";"101";"2023-06-28T12:09:27"

Just curious how other investors decide on which stocks to pick? For example, I saw that QQQ, VTI, VOO, & IVV all have done about 10% per year, the last 10 years, and since they're index funds, figured they'd be somewhat safe) but then saw some like Apple, Microsoft, & Nvidia have done up to 27% per year for the last 10 years and want to make the most of my money so I can retire someday (currently 29 years old)  Additional Info: Grew up poor, with next to no financial education and just trying to learn so I can have a good financial future, and pretty much just try to self educate with Google and YouTube (like Graham Stephan, Andrei Jikh, etc).

First: **Discord**, we all know it. But for the boomers, they launched in 2015 and has emerged as a dynamic digital communication hub, acclaimed for its comprehensive text, voice, and video chat features. Originally a favourite among gaming enthusiasts, its intuitive design and extensive functionalities have drawn a broad spectrum of online groups. This platform offers the creation and participation in servers with channels dedicated to specific topics, promoting a tailored space for interaction and teamwork. Notably, Discord's user-friendly interface, commitment to privacy and security, and seamless integration with various services have positioned it as a standout choice in online communication, extending its reach far beyond the gaming community.  > Why Discord Is a Prime IPO in 2024?  Investor excitement is mounting for Discord's IPO in 2024, driven by several key attributes. Primarily, Discord's successful transition from a gaming-centric platform to a versatile hub for various online communities highlights its vast growth potential. Its approachable interface and comprehensive communication tools, including text, voice, and video chat, have helped broaden its user base, fueling rapid expansion and a stronger market foothold.  Additionally, Discord's responsiveness to user preferences and ongoing innovation in platform enhancement resonate with the dynamic nature of digital communication. This positions the company favourably in a competitive and swiftly evolving market. Its emphasis on user privacy and security further enhances its attractiveness, particularly in today's climate where data protection is crucial.  From a financial standpoint, Discord demonstrates promising signs of a sustainable and scalable business model. The company's ability to attract and maintain a large, active user community opens doors for revenue growth, notably through premium subscriptions and strategic partnerships.  Therefore, I view Discord's IPO as an enticing investment avenue. Their strategic position in the digital communication realm, coupled with its potential for significant impact and leadership in the industry, bolsters investor enthusiasm for Discord's entrance into the public market in 2024.  Then there's **Turo**, founded in 2009 and headquartered in San Francisco, Turo has revolutionized the concept of car rentals with its peer-to-peer car-sharing platform. This innovative service allows private car owners to rent out their vehicles through an accessible online and mobile interface. This unique model not only provides car owners with an avenue to earn additional income but also presents renters with a more diverse and often more affordable range of vehicle options compared to conventional rental services.  Turo prides itself on its user-friendly platform, streamlining the process of listing, searching, and booking vehicles. The platform excels in offering convenience, a wide variety of choices, and accessibility, catering to an array of needs and preferences. From economical cars for daily use to luxury and unique models for special occasions, Turo accommodates a broad spectrum of requirements.  Having significantly expanded its operations across multiple countries, Turo offers a diverse array of vehicles. The company has carved a niche in the sharing economy with its innovative approach to car rentals, focusing on enhancing user experience and combining the strengths of community and technology to transform the traditional car rental landscape. As a result, Turo has emerged as a frontrunner in the car-sharing domain, continually adapting to the evolving demands of contemporary consumers.  > Why Turo Is a Prime IPO in 2024?  Investor enthusiasm for Turo's IPO in 2024 is fueled by the company's trailblazing role in the car-sharing economy and its potential for future expansion. As a leading figure in peer-to-peer car rentals, Turo capitalizes on the burgeoning trend of the sharing economy. This differentiates it from traditional car rental firms and aligns with a consumer shift towards more flexible and economical transportation options.  Turo harnesses the untapped potential of privately owned vehicles, offering owners a novel way to monetize their assets. This approach has broadened the car rental market, providing users with a greater variety of vehicles and personalized rental experiences. Turo's emphasis on a seamless user experience and customer satisfaction has further solidified its position in the market.  Investors are optimistic about Turo's scalability and growing user base, indicating robust market demand. The company's upward growth trajectory and the increasing acceptance of peer-to-peer services point to a bright future. Turo's adeptness in navigating various regulatory landscapes and adapting to different market conditions underscores its operational agility and resilience.  Considering these aspects, Turo's IPO represents a compelling opportunity for investors to align with a pioneering entity in the transformation of traditional car rental services. Turo's successful exploitation of technology to innovate within the automotive and transportation sectors marks it as an attractive investment prospect in an evolving economic environment.  ---  So both Discord and Turo present themselves as noteworthy IPOs to watch in 2024, each representing a significant shift in their respective industries. Discord, transcending its initial gaming roots, has evolved into a comprehensive digital communication platform with a wide-reaching influence. Its focus on user experience, privacy, and continuous innovation positions it as a strong contender in the digital communication sector. The company's scalable business model and ability to adapt to a rapidly changing digital landscape make it a compelling investment choice.  Turo, on the other hand, stands at the forefront of the car-sharing economy, redefining traditional car rental concepts with its peer-to-peer model. The company's growth trajectory, combined with its innovative approach and ability to meet diverse consumer needs, highlights its potential for long-term success in the evolving transportation sector. Turo's expansion and the increasing popularity of peer-to-peer services underscore its potential as a lucrative investment in the changing dynamics of the automotive industry.  For you guys, these two companies are a great example of the type of stuff we're looking for in an IPO, they are the kind of innovative, forward-thinking businesses that not only adapt to changing market demands but also lead the way in transforming their industries!";"0";"2024-01-31T01:03:04"

Apologies if the title does not fit quite right. My thoughts are for every Microsoft there are a number of other software companies that did not make it big yet seemed to be poised to lead the pack. For every Amazon, there are other e-commmerce companies which might have been equally as good if not better that didn't make it.

"Meta’s new AI assistant is rolling out across WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1c7e9xl/metas_new_ai_assistant_is_rolling_out_across/";"Meta  on Thursday announced its free artificial intelligence assistant, Meta AI, is rolling out across its social media platforms WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.  The assistant can answer questions, create animations and generate images, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video. Meta AI was built on the company’s latest large language model called Meta Llama 3, which was also announced Thursday.  The AI tool is Meta’s competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google  Gemini but, in a unique twist, Meta has also partnered with Google and Microsoft  to provide results from both companies’ search engines.  “We believe that Meta AI is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the video.  Shares of Meta closed up more than 1% Thursday.  Meta AI is built into the search box of the WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger apps so users can easily ask questions that can be answered through the new tool.  For instance, the company said users can ask Meta AI for restaurant recommendations, help planning a vacation or inspiration to decorate a new apartment.  Meta AI is also available on the website “meta.ai,” where users can ask the assistant for help with tasks like solving a math problem or writing a professional email, according to the release. Users can log their conversations for future reference.  Meta said the assistant’s image-generation feature will be available in beta on WhatsApp and the MetaAI website. Users will see an image appear as they start typing and MetaAI will provide prompts to help change or refine the image. The images can also be animated into a GIF that users can share.  Meta first introduced Meta AI in beta at its Connect event in September. The assistant is rolling out in English across more than a dozen countries including the U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Australia, starting Thursday.

Is it better to buy equal-weighted instead of market-cap weighted S&P 500 ETF? Some reasons why:  * Nvidia's advancements is going to ""democratize AI"" by making it cheaper. This means smaller companies might be able to displace bigger companies.  * I expect a period of growth in the next 6-12 months due to rate hike pausing. In these type of environments investors are going to move out of the safe tech bets (like Apple, Microsoft) and get back into more speculative, smaller cap names.  * I already hold stocks like Google, Amazon, and a lot of Apple & Tesla. I also wheel stocks like FB and Nvidia, so might get stuck with them as well.  Would love your opinions. Or if you just have general thoughts to share about equal vs market cap weighting, that's great as well.";"9";"2023-06-02T20:34:53"
"The P/E ratio is often times USELESS - Here's one example (NOKIA)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16vo7ol/the_pe_ratio_is_often_times_useless_heres_one/";"A low P/E ratio in the old days meant that a company was undervalued. However, accounting has changed a lot since.  I'd like to share an example that I recently stumbled across - Nokia.This post will also include some explanation related to tax loss carry forward, so if you're not familiar with that, that will change by the end.  Nokia has a P/E below 5. Prior to publishing the 2022 results, the P/E was 13. This means there was a HUGE increase in earnings (more than double). During the last year, the share price was down 18%, which seems a bit odd, for a company that just doubled its earnings, right?  Well, there's a good explanation for that.  Take a look at the following data:  2020: Profit before tax - EUR 743 million (Tax expense - EUR 3.3 billion)  2021: Profit before tax - EUR 1.9 billion (Tax expense - EUR 272 million)  2022: Profit before tax - EUR 2.2 billion (Tax benefit - EUR 2 billion)It seems that 2021 is the only year with a reasonable ratio between the expense and the profit before tax.  So, what happened in 2020 and 2022? Here's where tax loss carry forward comes into place. I'll try to elaborate with a simple example.  Imagine that you've started a business, and in the first year, you had a loss before tax of $10,000. In the majority of the countries, you can ""carry"" this loss forward into the next year, and use the losses to offset the profits.  Let's imagine your business had a profit before tax of $5,000 in year 2. Since you have $10,000 in losses carried forward, you can use half of that, to not pay taxes in year 2, and you still have $5,000 to carry forward in year 3.  Now, in year 3, the business did better, and your profit before tax was $8,000. Well, after using your last available losses, you have a tax base of $3,000. Let's assume that the tax rate is 25% --> You have to pay a corporate income tax of $750.  How is this reflected in the accounting of the company?  At the end of year 1, the $10,000 losses will help you not pay taxes of $2,500 ($10,000 \* 25%). This will be shown as a deferred tax asset.  At the end of year 2, there are $5,000 losses still left, so the deferred tax asset will now be $1,250.  At the end of year 3, there won't be any deferred tax assets arising from losses.  In some countries, the losses can be carried forward for 3 years, in some 5, and in some indefinite.  However, losses from one country cannot be used to offset profits in another country.  So, if this is so simple, how does this explain the Nokia example above?  There's one catch. If the company is not expected to use these losses against profits on time, the company is not allowed to recognize a deferred tax expense. Otherwise, it would be misleading investors that they'll pay less taxes in the future.  Here's an extract from Nokia's annual report:  ""*In 2020, Nokia de-recognized deferred tax assets in Finland, due to a regular assessment of our ability to utilize deferred tax assets in Finland for the foreseeable future, which was done primarily based on our historical performance.*  *At December 31 2022, Nokia concluded, based on its latest assessment, that it is probable that it will be able to utilize the unused tax losses and deductible temporary differences in Finland and re-recognized deferred tax assets of EUR 2.5 billion*""All of this is a fancy text that basically says:  In 2020, they expected the company not to be profitable on time, in order to use the losses the company generated in the past. So, the deferred tax asset that was previously recognized, is derecognized.  In 2022, this has changed, as the profitability in Finland improved, and now it is likely that the company will generate profits and be able to use the previously generated losses on time.This event led to huge swings in the income statement (and balance sheet) both in 2020 and 2022.  If we adjust the result of 2022 for the 2.5 billion, the net profit is closer to EUR 1.7 billion (vs. EUR 4.4 billion reported), so the P/E ratio of 4.8, is actually above 12.I hope that you enjoyed the post!";"60";"2023-09-29T23:39:10"
"What’s the future of Apple?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b7d0v8/whats_the_future_of_apple/";"The world is going into the AI era, and I just don’t see Apple in it.  It seems iPhone is close to its fullest potential, they are throwing the same phone out for many years now, and people are much less hyped about it. While back then, it was worth it to get the new one every year for the upgrades, now new iPhones are just A(n+1) processor, new colors, and a bit better camera. They look the same too, so it has lost its “status symbol” attribute too. I don’t see it changing soon. Pretty much same with iPads. Apple Watch is like.. it’s a watch, they can improve on it, but I don’t see people sitting on needles waiting when the new one will come out. They can improve battery life, make it brighter every year as the sun, make it do something with every sort of sign language hand movements (why though?) but that’s it. Macs aren’t going to save them either, they are faster for sure, but there’s not a huge market for them, or in other words, no massive growth is expected. There’s potential in VR, but in my opinion VR is very very far from being able to be an everyday wearable, and it’s for sure they won’t be the ones developing VR to that point. Why? Well, that’s my main point. Apple has never been an innovator, they were always the last to adapt something, and only when they were able to “perfect it” (even though they have massively failed many times). I’m just afraid they aren’t good positioned for either promising areas: AI, and VR. My theory is they will be afraid of AI, because it’s something that’s much harder to control, and perfect. I don’t see how Apple, being a control freak, would be able to live with something that’s not predictable. For VR, I think they will wait until they will be way late from the game. They will come out with something that’s 5 years behind, but I’m not sure they will be able to get away with it (as they were able to do with iPhones - which I cannot understand how they did till this day). They also don’t have a shovel in the AI gold rush as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia do. I’m genuinely worried about the future of Apple, and seems like they can be the next Nokia. Just to clarify, I’m not anti Apple, I’m the one who buys all the crap they throw out (iPhone, watch, beats, Mac, iPad), that’s why I see they are getting less and less exciting.

"Google rebrands Bard AI to Gemini and launches a new app and subscription";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1alyebr/google_rebrands_bard_ai_to_gemini_and_launches_a/";"Google on Thursday announced a major rebrand of Bard, its artificial intelligence chatbot and assistant, including a fresh app and subscription options. Bard, a chief competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, is now called Gemini, the same name as the suite of AI models that power the chatbot.  Google also announced new ways for consumers to access the AI tool: As of Thursday, Android users can download a new dedicated Android app for Gemini, and iPhone users can use Gemini within the Google app on iOS.  Google’s rebrand and app offerings underline the company’s commitment to pursuing — and investing heavily in — AI assistants or agents, a term often used to describe tools ranging from chatbots to coding assistants and other productivity tools.  Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the firm’s commitment to AI during the company’s Jan. 30 earnings call. Pichai said he eventually wants to offer an AI agent that can complete more and more tasks on a user’s behalf, including within Google Search, although he said there is “a lot of execution ahead.” Likewise, chief executives at tech giants from Microsoft to Amazon underlined their commitment to building AI agents as productivity tools.  Google’s Gemini changes are a first step to “building a true AI assistant,” Sissie Hsiao, a vice president at Google and general manager for Google Assistant and Bard, told reporters on a call Wednesday.  Google on Thursday also announced a new AI subscription option, for power users who want access to Gemini Ultra 1.0, Google’s most powerful AI model. Access costs $19.99 per month through Google One, the company’s paid storage offering. For existing Google One subscribers, that price includes the storage plans they may already be paying for. There’s also a two-month free trial available.  Thursday’s rollouts are available to users in more than 150 countries and territories, but they’re restricted to the English language for now. Google plans to expand language offerings to include Japanese and Korean soon, as well as other languages.  The Bard rebrand also affects Duet AI, Google’s former name for the “packaged AI agents” within Google Workspace and Google Cloud, which are designed to boost productivity and complete simple tasks for client companies including Wayfair, GE, Spotify and Pfizer. The tools will now be known as Gemini for Workspace and Gemini for Google Cloud.  Google One subscribers who pay for the AI ​​subscription will also have access to Gemini’s assistant capabilities in Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides and Meet, executives told reporters Wednesday. Google hopes to incorporate more context into Gemini from users’ content in Gmail, Docs and Drive. For example, if you were responding to a long email thread, suggested responses would eventually take in context from both earlier messages in the thread and potentially relevant files in Google Drive.  As for the reason for the broad name change? Google’s Hsiao told reporters Wednesday that it’s about helping users understand that they’re interacting directly with the AI ​​models that underpin the chatbot.  “Bard [was] the way to talk to our cutting-edge models, and Gemini is our cutting-edge models,” Hsiao said.  Eventually, AI agents could potentially schedule a group hangout by scanning everyone’s calendar to make sure there are no conflicts, book travel and activities, buy presents for loved ones or perform a specific job function such as outbound sales. Currently, though, the tools, including Gemini, are largely limited to tasks such as summarizing, generating to-do lists or helping to write code.  “We will again use generative AI there, particularly with our most advanced models and Bard,” Pichai said on the Jan. 30 earnings call, speaking about Google Assistant and Search. That “allows us to act more like an agent over time, if I were to think about the future and maybe go beyond answers and follow-through for users even more.”  Source: www.cnbc.com/2024/02/08/google-gemini-ai-launches-in-new-app-subscription.html";"518";"2024-02-08T16:34:39"

Developers use HashiCorp’s software to set up and manage infrastructure in public clouds that companies such as Amazon and Microsoft operate. Organizations also pay HashiCorp for managing security credentials.  Citing unnamed sources, The Wall Street Journal said a deal could materialize in the next few days.  HashiCorp and IBM representatives both told CNBC they do not comment on market rumors or speculation.  Founded in 2012, HashiCorp went public on Nasdaq in 2021. The company generated a net loss of nearly $191 million on $583 million in revenue in the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, according to its annual report. In December, Mitchell Hashimoto, co-founder of HashiCorp, whose family name is reflected in the company name, announced that he was leaving.  Revenue jumped almost 23% during that period, compared with 2% for IBM in 2023. IBM executives pointed to a difficult economic climate during a conference call with analysts in January. The hardware, software and consulting provider reports earnings on Wednesday.  Cisco held $9 million in HashiCorp shares at the end of March, according to a regulatory filing. Cisco held early acquisition talks with HashiCorp, according to a 2019 report.  IBM shares slipped after publication of the Wall Street Journal article but quickly recovered.

"Google in Crisis";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b4d5mn/google_in_crisis/";"https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/inside-the-crisis-at-google   It’s not like artificial intelligence caught Sundar Pichai off guard. I remember sitting in the audience in January 2018 when the Google CEO said it was as profound as electricity and fire. His proclamation stunned the San Francisco audience that day, so bullish it still seems a bit absurd, and it underscores how bizarre it is that his AI strategy now appears unmoored.  The latest AI crisis at Google — where its Gemini image and text generation tool produced insane responses, including portraying Nazis as people of color — is now spiraling into the worst moment of Pichai’s tenure. Morale at Google is plummeting, with one employee telling me it’s the worst he’s ever seen. And more people are calling for Pichai’s ouster than ever before. Even the relatively restrained Ben Thompson of Stratechery demanded his removal on Monday.    Yet so much — too much — coverage of Google’s Gemini incident views it through the culture war lens. For many, Google either caved to wokeness or cowed to those who’d prefer not to address AI bias. These interpretations are wanting, and frankly incomplete explanations for why the crisis escalated to this point. The culture war narrative gives too much credit to Google for being a well organized, politics-driven machine. And the magnitude of the issue runs even deeper than Gemini’s skewed responses.   There’s now little doubt that Google steered its users’ Gemini prompts by adding words that pushed the outputs toward diverse responses — forgetting when not to ask for diversity, like with the Nazis — but the way those added words got there is the real story. Even employees on Google’s Trust and Safety team are puzzled by where exactly the words came from, a product of Google scrambling to set up a Gemini unit without clear ownership of critical capabilities. And a reflection of the lack of accountability within some parts of Google.  ""Organizationally at this place, it's impossible to navigate and understand who's in rooms and who owns things,” one member of Google’s Trust and Safety team told me. “Maybe that's by design so that nobody can ever get in trouble for failure.”  Organizational dysfunction is still common within Google, something it’s worked to fix through recent layoffs, and it showed up in the formation of its Gemini team. Moving fast while chasing OpenAI and Microsoft, Google gave its Product, Trust and Safety, and Responsible AI teams input into the training and release of Gemini. And their coordination clearly wasn’t good enough. In his letter to Google employees addressing the Gemini debacle this week, Pichai singled out “structural changes” as a remedy to prevent a repeat, acknowledging the failure.  Those structural changes may turn into a significant rework of how the organization operates. “The problem is big enough that replacing a single leader or merging just two teams probably won’t cut it,” the Google Trust and Safety employee said.  Already, Google is rushing to fix some of the deficiencies that contributed to the mess. On Friday, a ‘reset’ day Google, and through the weekend — when Google employees almost never work — the company’s Trust and Safety leadership called for volunteers to test Gemini’s outputs to prevent further blunders. “We need multiple volunteers on stand-by per time block so we can activate rapid adversarial testing on high priority topics,” one executive wrote in an internal email.   And as the crisis brewed internally, it escalated externally when Google shared the same type of opaque public statements and pledges about doing better that have worked for its core products. That underestimated how different the public’s relationship is with generative AI than other technology, and made matters worse.   Unlike search, which points you to the web, generative AI is the core experience, not a route elsewhere. Using a generative tool like Gemini is a tradeoff. You get the benefit of a seemingly-magical product. But you give up control. While you may get answers quickly, or a cool looking graphic, you lose touch with the source material. To use it means putting more trust in giant companies like Google, and to maintain that trust Google needs to be extremely transparent. Yet what do we really know about how its models operate? Continuing on as it if were business as usual, Google contributed to the magnitude of the crisis.  Now, some close to Google are starting to ask if it’s focused in the right places, coming back to Pichai’s strategic plan. Was it really necessary, for instance, for Google to build a $20 per month chatbot, when it could simply imbue its existing technology — including Gmail, Docs, and its Google Home smart speakers — with AI?  There are all worthwhile questions, and the open wondering about Pichai’s job is fair, but the current wave of Generative AI is still so early that Google has time to adjust. On Friday, for instance, Elon Musk sued OpenAI for betraying its founding agreement, a potential setback for the company’s main competitor.  Google, which just released a powerful Gemini 1.5 model, will have at least a few more shots until a true moment for panic sets in. But everyone within the company knows it can’t afford many more of the previous week’s incidents, from Pichai to the workers pulling shifts this weekend.  ";"716";"2024-03-02T03:30:14"

Most of their revenue are from sports game and Ultimate Team microtransactions, which isn't going to help the stock go up because they're just consistent cash cows that are already baked in to everyone's forecast and there's not much upside.  The only studio they have that has a shot of producing new hits that actually provides upside to the stock is Respawn. Apex Legends helped a lot, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was great as well but wasn't enough for this earnings call.  Do not mention DICE since their last blockbuster success was Battlefield 1 in 2018 and every Battlefield after that hasn't been successful. That was 7 years ago.  Besides Respawn & sports games, nothing else matters for EA and I just don't see this stock going anywhere far as an independent company.  The next catalyst is the ATVI acquisition officially closing and should get EA back to the $130s. Then is how does the rebranding of EA's soccer game goes that you'll see during the holidays and as long as people buy the game still since there's no better alternative for soccer, it should stay at $130 and maybe touch $140.  After this I think they need to sell. Take advantage that they'll be the biggest pure-play video game company and with ATVI off the list big tech who wants to catch up with Microsoft should give a bid for EA. If they don't sell, I just don't see anything meaningful driving this stock higher.";"18";"2023-08-09T18:25:58"
"Amazon stock analysis: Why it's my only holding in my portfolio";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ah1ift/amazon_stock_analysis_why_its_my_only_holding_in/";"I'm more bullish on Amazon today than I was two days ago. Even though their stock price has increased by 6% in after markets. I think Amazon is valued less today than before their earnings. Their earnings were that good. I'll share with you my thoughts on Amazon and why my investing portfolio will change form 80% Amazon and 20% Google to 100% Amazon the second the market opens.  Let's have a look at all their revenue streams very briefly.  AWS. Cloud computing. In the words of Andy Jassy: a technology that will change businesses around the world with the same amount of impact the invention of electricity had on businesses. Businesses are only just now starting to adopt. We are still early in the early phases of cloud computing. AWS hit 90 billion in sales this year. And their last two quarters AWS had an operating income of 30%. AWS is getting more reasons to adopt and more reasons to increase spending by their customers due to the many AI solutions it offers to companies. It's safe to say AWS will hit 100 billion in revenue next year and that this will bring in around 30 billion in operating income. Many people are scared that AWS will have their customers stolen by Azure. Firstly, 90% of the cloud engineers I talk to, prefer AWS. Secondly, it costs a ton of money to set up cloud infrastructure for businesses. Why would they throw all their money away and spend this once again to make a switch to a different cloud provider. The majority of the current customers Amazon has aren't going anywhere. You can basically look at it as a subscription. Lastly on AWS, AWS has 6 times more server capacity than the next 12 competitors combined.  Advertising. Many people tend to forget how big Amazon advertising is. It generated $47 billion in the last twelve months and it's growing at 27% year on year. That means if there are 3 more years of 25% growth we are nearing an other nearly 100 billion revenue stream. And although we don't know their margins on advertising we know nearly certainly that it's generating higher profit margins than Meta or Google due to the fact that Amazon advertising is way more targeted. Oh you're looking at Amazon.com to buy a BBQ? Here's and advertisement of a BBQ. The cost per click on those type of ads will be very high.  Warehouse and logistics. This is the least sexy side of the business, but because of the amount of revenue it's still up there potential wise. Amazon online stores and third party sellers generated $410 billion in revenue in 2023. Amazon is the leader in logistics robotics. This has not only been told by Amazon, but this was dropped in the FedEx earnings call a few quarters back. Amazon is the company that will offer the best solutions as of now. They will most likely first fulfill their own needs and afterwards export their robotics to other parties for profit although now we are getting way ahead of ourselves as Amazon still hasn't impacted their own margins. Fulfillment cost used to hover around 27% of the product sales in 2020. After Covid, Amazon invested heavily in infrastructure for logistics. This increases maintenance and the need of personnel. Also they grew too much and too fast decreasing their margins. Their fulfillment cost was 31% of product sales in 2021, 35% in 2022 peaking at 37% in Q1 2023 and now ending Q4 2023 at 34% averaging once again 35% of the net product sales being the cost of fulfillment for the full year of 2023. But we see a decrease. Amazon went from 37% in Q1 2023 to now 34% in Q4 2023. This may not seem like a lot but when we are talking about such big numbers that this has significant impact. If Amazon would get their total fulfillment cost percentage compared to net product sales down to 33% for a full year this would leave Amazon with an extra 6 billion operating income. If Amazon would get the percentage down to 30% this would mean $13.5 billion more operating income than FY2023. If Amazon would get back to their previous 27%. This would mean a total of $21 billion more operating income. And keeping their current price to operating cash flow of 20 in mind (which is low compared to the historic mean of 27) an increase of $21 billion in a year means an increase of $420 billion in market cap. Keeping automation in mind I think they should have little trouble getting back to their old percentage of 27% in the next three to five years.  Amazon Prime, now the majority of prime members are coming from the US, Europe is only just now receiving prime content from their own country and advertisements to subscribe to prime. I'm located in the Netherlands we had a company that is comparable to Amazon for online products for here and Belgium way before Amazon arrived here. Amazon has been in the Netherlands since 2014 but they are just now completely blowing the competitor out of the water. Since one year me and many others are only using Amazon and now we are seeing ads to subscribe to prime. Subscribing to prime is only valuable if you actually make use of the logistics side of things. But it helps if prime has other things to offer as well. That's where we get to my next point. Prime video is partnering up with lots of famous people here to make Prime content. And the content isn't bad at all. That prime content hasn't even been rolling out for 6 months. Prime is just in its infancy for many countries it has recently moved into. Like I said Amazon is here since 2014 but only now I'm seeing Dutch shows on Amazon prime and having lots of people ask me to share my prime account with them. I'm sure the Netherlands wont be alone in this, it will be all the other countries as well. And guess what Amazon prime just received an additional big revenue stream, advertising. All users will receive advertisements unless they pay a few dollars a month to not see ads. Netflix earns more per subscriber that's on the cheaper subscription with ads than it does on the more expensive subscription without ads.  Additionally Amazon International gets even less love. Understandable though it's less revenue and barley sees a positive quarter. But what people forget is that it took Amazon US 10 years to turn profitable. So why do we think that International will be any faster, especially considering there is less infrastructure in countries outside of the US. I'd say we might need to wait 15 years for those countries to start making a profit. So which countries have been operational for longer than 15 years? The United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, China and Canada. Which countries have been operational for less than 15 years? Italy, Spain, Brazil, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore, Australia, Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Poland, Egypt and Belgium. We don't only need time for Amazon to build out the infrastructure. The middleclass in many of these countries is still growing which will increase activity in buying. And lastly, we need to give Amazon time to make Amazon prime subscription a valuable subscription in these countries by adding local content to Prime Video.  Amazon infrastructure, like I previously mentioned AWS has 6 times the server capacity compared to the next 12 competitors. Amazon is spending by far the most on renewable energy sources. They spent $2.5 billion on renewable energy, all to power their delivery vans and their servers. Although it may not seem huge but generating their in house electricity is bound to save them billions in the long run. Also Amazon is making their own chips for their AWS servers, they don't depend on a different party to be able to deliver. This in turn also increases their margins.  Lastly, Amazon is not sitting still. They have Amazon Gaming, Project Kuiper which has 3.000 satellites in orbit, they are making a plan to revolutionize the healthcare system and make it more cost and time efficient. They say in their call that they are still investing money to look for the next big pillar of Amazon, something that will be as big as AWS, advertising or Prime. They're not sitting still.  Okay story wise, I might have convinced you by now. But you could say, this is all a bunch of promising words. What about their valuation? Due to the fact Amazon invests a lot of their cash flow Amazon has usually been valued based on their price to operating cash flow. If we take the current after market price of Amazon of $169. Their current price to operating cash flow is at 20.6. This is 15% lower than what it was 2 days ago and this is 35% lower compared to their historical median price to operating cash flow of 27. Now this doesn't per se have to mean they will ever get back to that median price to operating cash flow so lets look at some different valuation methods. Remember Paypal was attractive to many people because it was ""only at a PE of 30"" instead of the usual 60. So lets keep on looking.  In Q4 of 2023 alone Amazon produced $30 billion free cash flow. Now Q4 is always a record quarter so we can't multiply this by 4. Q3 of 2023 Amazon had a free cash flow of $10 billion. This was still a quarter where many of their cost saving initiatives hadn't yet fully come to fruition, so although it was a much better quarter than Q2 which generated 6 billion in free cash flow. I'm very certain that Q3 free cash flow will be more in line with upcoming quarter. If we multiply 10 billion by 3 and 30 billion once. That's a free cash flow of 60 billion. This would be their free cash flow in 2024 if they don't grow, don't further increase margins and don't continue to lessen their investing of cash flow. If we take a quite reasonable (in my opinion) price to free cash flow of 30 times we see that Amazon stock should be valued at 1800 billion market cap. That's pretty much where the marketcap is at right now. Although I'm a firm believer that Amazon will grow in 2024. Let's not forget they are giving all their prime members ads from now on, or the ability to pay more for no ads. This alone will generate around 2 billion free cash flow in my estimation. Other than that I'm expecting Amazon to grow it's already existing revenue streams further, increase its margin further and decrease CAPEX. Which should result in record free cash flow in 2024. I'm estimating 12 billion in Q1, 13 billion in Q2, 15 billion in Q3 and 38 billion in Q4. Now I would love to tell you that these estimations are highly calculated by me and a pack of mathematicians. But I'll have to disappoint you and say that it's not. I've been doing estimates on Amazon every quarter based on the trends I see in the numbers and the story I pair with it. I have been quite spot on with the numbers so far. If my estimation would be reasonably close it would mean a market cap of 2.340 trillion, an increase of 34% at a price to free cash flow of 30 or an increase to a market cap of 2.730, an increase of 57% at a price to free cash flow of 35. Do note Microsoft is valued at 40 times price to free cash flow. And although I think Amazon and Microsoft should be valued similarly I find it hard to justify a price to free cash flow of 40 or more if you're not growing cash flow above 20% YoY.  We could also disassemble the components of Amazon and value these components with the price to sales of a company that offers similar services. To some people this might be a bit more hocus-pocus but I like doing this to see where Amazon stands in the market compared to other stocks. I'm using price to sales in this example because sadly we do not know the operating income on Amazon advertising and on Amazon Prime.  AWS had a total sales in FY 2023 of $90 billion. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Microsoft of 13 times. Resulting in AWS having a marketcap of $1,170 billion.  Amazon advertising has a total sales in FY 2023 of $47 billion. Lets get the average price to sales of two companies for this one. Google of 6 times price to sales and Meta of 8 times. Thus we multiply by 7. Resulting in Amazon advertising having a marketcap of $329 billion. Even though Amazon advertising has higher margins and is growing faster than Google and Meta.  Next up Amazon Prime had a total sales of $40 billion in FY 2023. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Netflix of 7.5. Resulting in Amazon Prime having a marketcap of $300 billion.  Lastly Amazon online stores, physical stores and logistics services offered to third party sellers generated a total revenue of 392$ billion in FY 2023. Lets take a price to sales of 0.70 based on the price to sales of Walmart at 0.71 and the price to sales of FedEx at 0.69. Resulting in a market cap of $274 billion dollars.  If we calculate all the components together we have a total market cap from Amazon of 2.073 trillion. An increase of 18.5% form the current prices. And this is based on historic number, not forward looking. Similarly when using the price to operating cash flow Amazon had two days ago of 23 we see that Amazon's stock is valued at a 15% cheaper price now than just two days ago. Supporting the argument that Amazon is more less 15% undervalued based on current prices, not forward looking expectations. This is why I moved my Google position into Amazon. As Google is looking undervalued by 15% on forward looking prices, but Amazon is looking undervalued by the same amount based on historic prices. Meaning if we expect Amazon to do slightly better in the future Amazon is a better buy than Google.  TLDR: I think Amazon is undervalued by 15% based on historic numbers. Forward looking though, I expect Amazon to be more less undervalued by around 30% - 50% based on end of on end of FY 2024 numbers. This is based on how well they execute increasing their margins, decreasing CAPEX and continuing their business trends growth wise.";"231";"2024-02-02T12:25:46"
"Is now a good time to invest in cybersecurity (after MGM and Caesars Casino hack?)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16kl2bo/is_now_a_good_time_to_invest_in_cybersecurity/";"It seems like every few months there is a major hack in the news. We do not hear about the everyday hacking that is happening to businesses that are local or to everyday people. As someone who had their identity stolen years ago I now make sure my identity theft protection is paid before I even get food. Businesses likewise are probably willing to set aside an additional 1-2% of their budget for cybersecurity. For those unaware MGM and Caesars online casinos had a hacking situation recently and some ransom (in the millions) was paid. [https://qz.com/young-hackers-are-sticking-up-las-vegas-casinos-for-hef-1850837238](https://qz.com/young-hackers-are-sticking-up-las-vegas-casinos-for-hef-1850837238)      I know plenty of white hat hackers (those are the good people - black hats are the bad ones). My friends who are white hat hackers say it is unreal how easy things can be breached. The only solution in their eyes is better cybersecurity. I am not sure why so many cybersecurity stocks (i.e. Cloudflare \[NET\], Crowdstrike \[CRWD\], etc) did not continue to run from their highs over the past 24 months. Maybe someone on here would know why that is?   I see the following stocks having a good run over the next 24 months:   1) Endava plc \[DAVA\]: Earnings very soon, rated a ""buy"" from sources ([https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DAVA&ty=c&p=d&b=1](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DAVA&ty=c&p=d&b=1)) and is well below its ATH. This company is out of the UK so for those who only want USA stocks be aware.   2) Cloudflare: This stock along with Palo Alto are good long term holds, well past 24 months.   The only thing that could hurt these stocks, since AI is booming and with more AI comes more hacking would be if companies like Salesforce, Microsoft, etc completely form a better cybersecurity set of products than the big name cybersecurity companies do. The one stock I like to swing trade in the cybersecurity field is OKTA, have used it to swing trade recently for an 11% gain and did so back in 2021. Feel like there is plenty of money to be made in cybersecurity stocks.   My current holdings: 31 shares of Cloudflare, 12 shares of Palo Alto, 128 shares of DAVA (swing trade - probably will perform well in upcoming earnings), and exited my position (11) shares of OKTA recently after my gain.

"British American Tobacco: Heads I win, tails I…still win";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16f47ll/british_american_tobacco_heads_i_win_tails_istill/";"Hello, fellow investors!  &#x200B:   I have recently added British American Tobacco to my portfolio as I believe that its current share price presents an exceptionally compelling risk-reward proposition when weighed against alternative investment opportunities. Following is a concise summary of my reasoning that I would like to present for your feedback.     **THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES ARE TO BE FOUND IN BEAR MARKETS**   Sooner or later, regardless of how exceptional they are, companies find themselves in the midst of multi-year downturns. It happened to Coca Cola, PepsiCo, Microsoft, and Apple, just to name a few.   The only time British American Tobacco has been cheaper than today was at the end of the largest civil litigation settlement in U.S. history, which resulted in the tobacco companies paying the states and territories billions of dollars in yearly instalments. *It went then on to become a* ***15-bagger*** *over the subsequent 17 years,* ***not accounting for dividends***.   Now, the company does currently face noteworthy challenges (i.e. negative secular trends in smoking and a substantial debt burden), but the current valuation seems to be factoring in a higher level of risk than may actually exist.    **DECLINING SMOKING RATES**   Even though smoking rates continue to decline, the company is effectively offsetting the trend through a successful diversification of its product portfolio. The oligopolistic nature of tobacco markets also gives them significant pricing power, especially since demand for their products is relatively inelastic, resulting in inordinate profitability and robust cash flows.    **DEBT BURDEN**   The company has debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years, and due to higher interest rates, net finance costs are expected to increase as debts are refinanced.   However, it currently holds about £4 billion in cash, expects to generate at least an additional £5+ billion in post-dividend free cash flow, and had access to an undrawn £5.5 billion revolving credit facility as of 30 June 2023. This sums up to more than £14 billion in liquidity available to meet its debt obligations within the specified time frame. Contrary to claims of insolvency, the company's financials demonstrate otherwise.     **HEADS I WIN, TAILS I...STILL WIN**   It does not happen very often that companies with cash flows so consistent and predictable offer a ***FCF yield of 17%***. Not to mention the fact that they're still growing earnings and that a multiple expansion is not unlikely over the next decade (In 2000, the company traded at just 7x earnings before eventually returning to its historical norm of 13 to 14x).   This is an ***immensely-wide moat and non-cyclical stock*** ***currently paying a 9% dividend yield*** with a conservative 60% earnings payout ratio and a well-established track record of dividend payments spanning many decades. Investors are getting average stock market returns from the dividend alone.         I wanted to keep the post short and focus on the company's primary key facts, but I hope nonetheless you found the information interesting and worthy of further exploration!";"127";"2023-09-10T18:13:12"
"Zoom shares jump as quarterly results beat on top and bottom lines";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b118hg/zoom_shares_jump_as_quarterly_results_beat_on_top/";"Zoom shares rose as much as 13% in extended trading on Monday after the video chat software vendor announced fiscal fourth-quarter results that topped analysts’ expectations.  Here’s how the company did, compared with consensus among analysts polled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:  Earnings per share: $1.22 adjusted vs. $1.15 expected  Revenue: $1.15 billion vs. $1.13 billion expected  Revenue increased less than 3% from $1.12 billion a year earlier, according to a statement. The company reported net income of $298.8 million, or 98 cents per share, for the quarter that ended Jan. 31, compared with a net loss of $104.1 million, or 36 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.  Far from its heyday during the Covid-19 pandemic, when a surge in the number of remote workers sent revenue up over 100% for five straight quarters, Zoom is now mired in single-digit growth.  Growth would have been faster in the fiscal fourth quarter if not for a sales reorganization. It “took a lot of time for the organization to recover from, frankly,” Kelly Steckelberg, Zoom’s finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts.  At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, Zoom had 220,400 enterprise customers, up from 219,700 at the end of the prior quarter.  Zoom’s Team Chat migration tool “has seen a 4x increase in downloads in the last six months,” Eric Yuan, the company’s founder and CEO, said during the call. He said Zoom hasn’t done a great job of marketing its chat capabilities.  For the fiscal first quarter, Zoom called for $1.18 to $1.20 in adjusted earnings per share on $1.125 billion in revenue, which would represent growth of less than 2% from a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were looking for $1.13 in adjusted earnings per share and $1.13 billion in revenue.  For the 2025 fiscal year, Zoom sees $4.85 to $4.88 in adjusted earnings per share, with $4.60 billion in revenue, implying 1.6% revenue growth. The LSEG consensus was adjusted earnings of $4.71 per share and revenue of $4.65 billion.  Before the jump, Zoom shares were down 12% so far this year, while the S&P 500 stock index had gained 6% during the same period.

"Shari Redstone the controlling shareholder of Paramount would consider a Merger or Sale of Paramount";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17eqp4h/shari_redstone_the_controlling_shareholder_of/";"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/22/paramount-shari-redstone-might-have-missed-deal-window.html  >Shari Redstone may have missed her window. Paramount Global’s controlling shareholder is open to a merger or selling the company at the right price, according to people familiar with her thinking. And she has been open to it for several years, said the people, who asked not to speak publicly because the discussions have been private. The problem has been finding the right deal for shareholders. Market conditions have made a transformative transaction difficult at best and highly unlikely at worst. “The market is crying out for reshaping media company portfolios and consolidation,” said Jon Miller, chief executive at Integrated Media and a senior advisor at venture firm Advancit Capital, which Redstone co-founded. “But the deck is stacked against large-scale transactions now because of both immediate concerns in terms of ad sales, subscription video numbers and the cost of debt. No one wants to transact at the current market valuations that these companies are given.”  >Paramount Global is an archetype for the media industry’s consolidation conundrum. The company consists of Paramount Pictures, the CBS broadcast network, 28 owned-and-operated local CBS stations, the streaming service Paramount+, free advertising-supported Pluto TV, “Star Trek,” “SpongeBob SquarePants,” MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET and Showtime. It also owns the physical Paramount studio lot in Los Angeles, California. From a sum-of-the-parts perspective, the company holds a strong hand. Many of Paramount Global’s assets would fit nicely within larger media companies. “Paramount has a tremendous amount of assets in its content library and they own some pretty powerful sports rights in the form of the NFL contract, Champions League soccer and March Madness,” Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris told CNBC last week. “But, they are still losing money on their streaming service,” Morris said. “They need to pull these things together, right-size the content, super charge that topline through pricing and penetration, and then we can see investors get excited about this idea again.”  >Declining revenue from the acceleration of pay-TV cord-cutting, continued streaming losses and rising interest rates have put Redstone in a bind. The company’s market capitalization has slumped to $7.7 billion, nearly the company’s lowest valuation since Redstone merged CBS and Viacom in 2019. At the time, that transaction gave the combined company a market valuation of about $30 billion. It’s unclear whether staying the course will help turn investor sentiment. Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, one of Paramount Global’s biggest shareholders, told CNBC in April that streaming “is not really a very good business.” He also noted that shareholders in entertainment companies “really haven’t done that great over time.” Paramount Global’s direct-to-consumer businesses lost $424 million in the second quarter and $511 million in the first quarter.

Question 1: The stock market in early 2020 slid approximately 35% in less than 3 weeks. Can this ever happen again, say if China invades Taiwan? I am skeptical if this sort of 35% crash can even happen because there are so many people in retirement right now compared to say early 2020. The people who have their pensions, 401(k), IRAs, etc etc directly in the broader market are not going to be pressing sell in good times, bad times or sideways times. For most of them they cannot sell because it is not for them to delegate the funds. This is why I especially do not believe the market really can slide more than say 30%.

"How US stocks rose 20% from their lows, and where they might be going";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/145049d/how_us_stocks_rose_20_from_their_lows_and_where/";"U.S. stocks have defied fears of a recession, a banking crisis and soaring Treasury yields to rise 20% from their October lows - one definition of a bull market.      The benchmark S&P 500 index closed at a low of 3,577.03 on Oct. 12, 2022, down 25% from its all-time high after the Federal Reserve unleashed a series of bruising interest rate increases to fight decades-high inflation.      On Thursday, it closed up 0.6% at 4,293.93, amid growing optimism over the economic outlook and a rate hiking cycle that appears to be nearing its end. Here are some features of the index's rally, and a look at where stocks might go from here.  While markets seldom rise in a straight line, the S&P 500's journey from the bottom took 164 days - the longest 20% climb from a bear market low in five decades. Among the factors holding stocks back was a surge in Treasury yields to their highest levels in decades that dulled the allure of equities by offering investors the potential to earn attractive income in government-backed bonds.      A crisis that saw the biggest bank busts since the Great Recession also shook investor confidence, as did worries over a potentially catastrophic fight over lifting the U.S. debt ceiling.  The narrow breadth of the S&P 500's rally has been a concern for some investors, with just seven stocks - Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) - responsible for almost all of the index's gains this year. Many investors view these stocks as safe bets in uncertain times. Their gains were also driven by excitement over advances in artificial intelligence.  More recently, however, the market's gains have shown tentative signs of broadening out to other stocks.  Meanwhile, volatility has subsided - not only in stocks, but in Treasuries and currencies.      One reason for the calm in markets is investors' belief that the Fed is unlikely to deliver many more of the rate hikes that shook asset prices last year.      Investors have also been encouraged by evidence showing that the U.S. economy continues to be resilient in the face of the central bank's monetary tightening, while inflation slowly cools. The U.S. Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (.CESIUSD) shows U.S. economic data has in aggregate topped market expectations, helped by stronger than expected numbers for employment and consumer spending.      A 20% gain from bear market lows has in the past heralded further upside for stocks.  In four of the last six bear markets, the S&P went on to rise 20% or more in the six months after hitting this milestone.

BofA Says Tech Stocks Just Saw Their Biggest Outflow in 10 Weeks.""";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14hhtr6/is_the_ailed_fcking_baby_bubble_bursting_bofa/";"The current AI-led ""baby bubble"" could be seen as a positive or a negative depending on the perspective. On the one hand, it is a sign of progress and innovation, with technology giants such as Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla leading the way. The stock prices of these companies have boomed this year, suggesting that investors are bullish on the future of AI.  On the other hand, there are some who are warning that the investor hype for AI could be short-lived and that the market could be heading for a significant correction. Bank of America's Michael Hartnett has compared the current AI boom to the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s, where the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 78%. UBS's Art Cashin and veteran economist David Rosenberg have also drawn parallels with the dot-com bubble.  Ultimately, it is difficult to know for sure whether the AI-led ""baby bubble"" will burst or if it will continue to grow and drive the stock market higher. It is important to remember that, while AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries, it is still a relatively new technology and there is a lot of uncertainty and risk associated with investing in AI-related stocks. As such, it is important for investors to do their due diligence and be aware of the potential downsides before investing in AI stocks.

"3 top growth stocks that billionaires keep buying left and right.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14jf13s/3_top_growth_stocks_that_billionaires_keep_buying/";"* Match Group's most popular application, Tinder isn't growing right now but billionaire investors keep buying the stock. * Roku leads its industry by the number of hours streamed but it's still losing a lot of money. * Automated accounting software provider, Bill.com is attracting billionaire investors with sales that keep soaring.  # These are the stocks that billionaire money managers can't seem to get enough of lately.     If you want to learn how to build enormous biceps, following the advice of Arnold Schwarzenegger makes a lot of sense. The same concept applies to stock market investing. If you want to build a stock portfolio that delivers enormous gains, studying the actions of the world's most successful investors is a great place to start.   You can learn a lot from following billionaire investors. Unfortunately one of those lessons is that they don't always get it right. Let's take a closer look at the stocks billionaires can't seem to get enough of to see if they belong in your portfolio.    **1. Match Group**   James Simons and Renaissance Technologies, the hedge fund he manages, bought about 1.6 million shares of Match Group ($MTCH) during the first three months of 2023.   Shares of the dating app provider are down about 80% from the peak it reached in 2021. It's been under more pressure than usual because it looks like the company's growth engines have sputtered out. Fiscal first-quarter Tinder sales remained flat compared to the previous year's period, and total revenue fell 1% year over year.   Simons was likely encouraged by signs that Match Group is becoming less reliant on Tinder, which generates 57% of total revenue. Fiscal first-quarter revenue from Hinge, a dating app that is ""designed to be deleted,"" grew 27% year over year.   At the moment, you can buy shares of Match Group for just 15.9 times forward-looking earnings estimates. Investors who buy the stock at this modest multiple could come out way ahead if Hinge continues along its current growth trajectory. Following Simon's lead on this stock probably isn't a bad idea.   **2. Roku**   Roku ($ROKU) stock is still down around 77% from the peak it reached in 2021. Perhaps sensing a bargain, Israel Englander and his hedge fund Millennium Management bought 670,000 shares of the streaming platform provider during the first three months of 2023.   Counting by hours streamed, Roku's platform leads and it's getting stronger. During the first quarter, people streamed 25.1 billion hours of video through Roku-enabled devices, which was a 20% improvement year over year.   The Roku operating system (OS) is the only smart TV OS built from the ground up for televisions. It's currently the leading smart TV OS, with a 43% share of TVs sold in the first quarter.   RoKu's on my watchlist and not in my portfolio because it lost a frightening $665 million over the past 12 months. If the streaming platform leader can't make ends meet, it could mean that this is just a rotten business to be in. It could also mean that the company's been poorly managed. Either way, it's probably best to steer clear of this stock until its bottom line starts heading toward profitability again.   **3. Bill Holdings**   Bill Holdings ($BILL), or Bill.com as it's more commonly known, is an accounting automation software provider that caters to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). James Simons and Renaissance Technologies bought 348,000 shares during the first three months of 2023.   Sinoms was probably attracted to Bill because the business is growing by leaps and bounds. Revenue during its fiscal third quarter ended March 31 rose 63% year over year.   Bill isn't profitable yet, but it's quickly headed in that direction. Its' fiscal third-quarter loss shrank to $31.1 million from $86.7 million in the previous year period.   Bill's business is growing faster than the other companies on this list, but the market has already baked a lot of future growth into its stock price. It's currently trading at 73 times forward-looking earnings expectations.   Bill's forward price-to-earnings multiple is so high that most cautious investors will steer clear of the stock. If you can tolerate the risk, though, buying Bill before it shoots even higher might be a good idea.   ";"0";"2023-06-26T13:43:05"
"Should I buy different ETFs depending on the type of account? IRA account vs. Individual Investment account.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16a8lbb/should_i_buy_different_etfs_depending_on_the_type/";"My mother recently passed away, and I inherited two Fidelity accounts that she had. One of the accounts was her IRA account. The other was an individual investment account. After taking a look at both of them, I realized that she has a ton of money in bonds. This made sense for someone her age, but for me, I'd like to completely revamp these accounts since I'm 32 years with a much higher risk tolerance.    She also has a ton of different individual stocks (over 70 different individual stocks) that I'd like to consolidate and use mostly ETFs instead. I will post my portfolio plan of action below. My main question is, should I be focusing mainly on ETFs that are dividend driven for the IRA account? While focusing mainly on non-dividend ETFs for my investment account? I know that with IRA accounts, you do not get taxed on dividends as yearly income like you would for investment accounts. I plan on buying the following ETFs for my investment account.   50% VOO (ETF)- Vanguard 500 Index Fund - 500 largest companies.  15% VTI (ETF)- Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund - Overall stock market.  10% AVUV (ETF)- Avantis US Small Cap Value -  US small-cap.  10% QQQ (ETF) - Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 - Invesco QQQ - Technology, NASDAQ top 100....Apple, Google, Microsoft, ect.  10% Individual Stocks - NVDA, META, AAPL, AMZN, MCD, TSLA, SHOP, etc.  5% XXUS (ETF)- VXUS-Vanguard Total International Stock ETF - ETF with international exposure.    Should I approach my IRA account any differently? For example instead of these ETFs mentioned above, maybe get more dividend driven ETFs such as SCHD, VYM, SPYD, DGRO, etc?";"9";"2023-09-05T02:05:30"
"What are the fundamental traits of promising companies?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18a7y62/what_are_the_fundamental_traits_of_promising/";"I am looking to build a screener that looks at some universal truths of promising companies. Something that when higher/lower it is basically always good. In this post I will argue for the inclusion of some traits and the avoidance of some common ones. Please see below:  What makes a promising company?  *Sales, Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Growth*: if you ain’t growing your dieing.  *High Gross Margins*: indication of significant value add  *Low Debt and Interest Coverage*: this is where risk of a company is. The lower the better, particularly if they are doing well in all the other factors.  *Low Shareholder Dilution*: like debt, if they are doing the other things well but give the company away, that’s no good.  Characteristics I’d argue against:  *Net Income margin, Operating Income Margin, ROE*: as you get farther down the income statement, more and more can be played with by management. Take AMZN for example. Look at this [chart](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-revenue-vs-profit-2016-1). AMZN had torrid growth and never grew earnings. Why did the stock go up even though it was and still kinda is a non-profit? They were reinvesting aggressively to fuel that growth ultimately growing their future cash flows more than they otherwise would have been if they showed a profit. Also by not having profits, you minimize taxes. AMZN isn’t the only one to do this, Salesforce did the same [thing](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/19/saupload_b70533bae99138dbebd44adae05789c8.png).  It’s not that I think NI, OI and ROE are bad, I am looking for promising companies that are before their maturity.  With ROE, that tells you where a company is, not where it’s going. Take Colgate, they have an ROE of 500%! Do we think that each incremental investment they make will yield a 500% ROE? of course not. They have been able to replace equity with debt to make the “E” smaller jacking up the ROE.  NI Margin is getting more manipulated with GAAP changes. For example, pass through gain and losses on security investments flow through the income statement. Berkshire is a classic case here.  OI Margin: As mentioned above, companies can purposefully spend more to boost growth and if you have say 60, 70, 80% gross margins, that seems like a great idea. This will mean no profits today, faster growth today, and hopefully a greater ability to harvest profits later.  *What do you think, are there any other universal truths of promising companies?*  Thank you for your insights!";"6";"2023-12-04T01:36:00"

"Massive Misconception About the Writers Strike";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15v6l9h/massive_misconception_about_the_writers_strike/";"What most people do not realize is that the majority of the major studies are owned by larger entities that do not suffer from this. Sure its small term pain knowing that certain projects are on hold. There is a lot of content in the coffers that they can still continue to produce without additional writing.  Most of the major studios also have other revenue streams that power them through. Let's just take Disney to start. They have $8.3B coming in from parks. They have $5.5B coming in from Streaming. They have 1.9 Billion coming in from cord deals.  Look at Comcast, they have Peacock streamers, they have their existing cable business, they have their internet business (mixed with cable subscribers), they have their mobile unit.. they have plenty to keep powering their way through.  Then you have weird companies like Apple and Amazon who can take virtual losses forever in entertainment and not care. Netflix is weird because of all its custom content but has a massive catalog of back content to keep subscribers happy for a while.  &#x200B:  What stocks to look at are the ones that rely only on content to stay alive. Those are the companies to be paying attention too. For instance I'd be very interested in how Warner Bro's/Discovery are going to be doing.  I'd also look at Sony who owes a lot to their entertainment divisions for profits (sure they do electronics and niche other areas), but they own some of the larger studios.  &#x200B:  I also don't want to make this a political topic but the Writers guild really needs to re-think their leverage. Sure the major studio's wont have new content coming out and already put a massive backlog and delays to projects. The major studios now are conglomerates that own so many other businesses they can keep moving along. They also don't realize that these studios will keep generating revenue but don't have to pay any of the writers, actors, production, etc... they have a freeze on money coming in but also a freeze on money going out.  The problem with industry consolidation + multi-faceted businesses is you lose your negotiating leverage.  &#x200B:  Would love to hear other peoples thoughts on this. What do you think?  &#x200B:  Especially their fear of AI As they know will becoming after their jobs. Netflix already was using it to determine what  shows and themes would be the most productive for returns. Disney/ILM started using it to replace opening credits. Disney even hired the group that for the end of Mando Season 2 were Luke showed up, another group of people showed they could do a better Deep Fake and they hired them. If I'm not mistaken Netflix used AI to write one of black mirrors episodes.  AI is coming and I can see why writers are so fearful. People are so naive on the idea that AI is coming for jobs even creative.  &#x200B:  If anything I'd love to hear from people some of the VFX studios if they are public? That would be were I would start putting money into. Ones that are progressive and have a massive catalogue. It sucks ILM is private (Disney owned), Pixar (Disney Owned), Dreamworks, etc.  &#x200B:  I wish Epic which powers the majority of games but also the Volume that is used in almost all new TV productions.... was public but they are private for now.  &#x200B:  **At the end of the day the stocks to pay attention to are:**  The Chips Needed to Make these: Intel, Nvidia, AMD  The Fabs that produce them: TSCM, Samsung, Intel  Then there are companies producing the software: Epic, Blender, Unity. Adobe  The Streaming Services: Netflix, Disney+, Max (Warner Bros) -- then you have youtube material being turned into its own streaming service like Curiositystream Inc.  The Companies that specialize in building AI  Model with datasets: OpenAI (Microsoft), Google, Facebook, ByteDance, etc.  Royalty Companies: Dolby, IMAX  **Then there are the host of startups creating custom chips for these tasks (ASICS), newer software, and existing VFX studios who know how to power them all. Which is where the money will be for future stocks.**";"332";"2023-08-19T06:51:49"
"Nvidia Stock Faces Decline In Coming Years As AI Chip Demand Softens, Warns Analyst: 'We're Looking At The Horizon'";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ctj169/nvidia_stock_faces_decline_in_coming_years_as_ai/";"The future of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock might not be as promising as its recent performance suggests, according to a prominent analyst.  What Happened: DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria has cautioned that Nvidia’s stock might not be able to sustain its meteoric rise due to a potential decline in demand for its GPUs, according to an interview on BNN Bloomberg.  Luria predicts that Nvidia’s profits for the last quarter will exceed $25 billion. However, he foresees a long-term decline for the chipmaker as it faces increasing competition, even from its own major customers.  “The reason we’re not quite as bullish as everybody else is we’re looking at the horizon. What’s going to happen next year? What’s going to happen in 2026? We think there’s accumulating more and more evidence this can’t continue,” Luria said. “Whenever one company extracts this much profit out of the market, competition does come in, and in Nvidia’s case, it’s coming in from its customers.   He noted that the majority of Nvidia’s business comes from its five largest customers, including Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Tesla, all of which are also major players in the AI sector. These firms are reportedly developing their own AI chips, posing a potential threat to Nvidia’s future.   Luria also pointed out that despite some customers stockpiling Nvidia’s GPUs, demand is likely to taper off eventually, leading to a decline in revenue. This could catch investors off guard, potentially resulting in a significant drop in the stock price.  Why It Matters: The warning from Luria comes at a time when Nvidia’s stock has been the subject of much discussion. The company’s stock has been on a remarkable rise, with a 240% surge in 2023 and an additional 80% increase in 2024.  This has led to a debate among investors on whether to buy now or wait for a potential drop in the stock price. The recent performance of Nvidia’s stock has sparked a debate among fund managers. Some, like Trent Masters, a portfolio manager at Alphinity Investment Management, suggest that the stock is still a good buy despite its significant rise. He points to the chipmaker’s strong market share and sustainable earnings as reasons for his bullish stance.  On the other hand, Luria’s warning is not the only one to have been issued recently. Chinese regulators have reportedly instructed local tech firms, including TikTok parent ByteDance, Tencent Holding Ltd, Alibaba Group Holding Limited, and Baidu Inc, to reduce their consumption of Nvidia’s AI chips and invest in more domestically made AI chips instead. This could potentially impact Nvidia’s future business in China.   However, not all analysts share Luria’s caution. HSBC Global Research recently maintained Nvidia with a Buy rating and lifted its 12-month price target, suggesting that the chipmaker’s strong pricing power will allow it to continue delivering upside surprises through fiscal-year 2026.  Despite the warnings, some analysts remain optimistic about Nvidia’s future. KeyBanc analyst John Vinh maintained an Overweight rating on Nvidia and a price target of $1,200, expecting Nvidia to report fiscal first-quarter results and second-quarter guidance meaningfully above expectations.";"0";"2024-05-16T19:51:53"
"Dilbert- cockroach and crosshair companies";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/153fjd0/dilbert_cockroach_and_crosshair_companies/";"Back in the mists of time (early 90’s), the old Dilbert website had a financial pages section where Scott Adams set up 4 different stock indices, 2 of them pretty frivolous and based on his comic, but two interesting ones. The RATBX was 10 companies directly in the crosshairs of Microsoft, Intel, Oracle and Cisco…the most notable stock being Apple at a current price of $0.19 which would be worth a kings ransom now ($142m for a $1000 stake if my maths is right). My big takeaway from this was that you don’t need (or should expect) everything in your portfolio to be a superstar, but it’s great to have the odd standout performer… but it’s a bit of a lottery. The DOGBX consisted of 10 cockroach companies who would be the last 10 on earth. Only 8 now exist… My takeaway from this is that this is the equivalent of your low cost, S and P tracker type fund and while you’d not get Apple type returns, you’ll get consistent long term gains ($376,000 over 20 years for a $10k stake I reckoned). My question is, if we picked cockroach or crosshairs companies now, who would they be?  https://web.archive.org/web/19990204000855/http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/financial/index.html";"2";"2023-07-19T02:31:55"
"2024 One Month Reflection";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1agem31/2024_one_month_reflection/";"Coming into 2024 there were hopes of six rate cuts.  Institutions started positioning themselves into small caps in November and December thinking the rate cuts will drive small caps.  Tech had such a great year last year, but most of the gains were from losses in 2022.  Based on chairman Powell's remarks yesterday it is unlikely we see a rate cut in march.  That is when we started to see another selloff.  Besides the rate cuts probably not happening until May their is also risk in the regional banking sector when they start realizing the losses in commercial real estate.   There is also instability in the Middle East which is affecting shipping.  Oil prices have not gone up yet due to this conflict.  As long as the conflict is contained and does not start to grow I don't see this being a big issue.    Tech earnings started to come in and it has been a mixed bag so far.  SMCI is showing great strength from the AI boom.  AMD's Lisa SU said,“We are in the very early stages of the AI computing era, and the rate of adoption and growth is faster than any other technology in recent history”  Microsoft reported 30% growth in Azure revenue.  Based on this information the broader market should start to  do better around April leading into the May Fed meeting.  There is risk if we don't see the rate cuts in May which are not guaranteed.  I would stay out of the regional banks even if their are cuts due to the commercial real estate risk.  Hopefully this will not bleed over to ther areas of the economy.   Lastly I think tech will continue to outperform for at least a few years due to the early AI cycle.  This is going to lead to PC sales, data center, and cellular phone sales, to name a few that will see growth due to everyone upgrading for the AI technology.  Growth in the income will start to then reflect in the stocks.  &#x200B:  What are your observations and how are you setting yourself up?";"3";"2024-02-01T17:12:59"
"NVDA shares have tripled in 2023, while the Nasdaq-100 has climbed 38% and the S&P 500 has gained 16%";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15o8539/nvda_shares_have_tripled_in_2023_while_the/";"AI Mania Triggers Dot-Com Bubble Flashbacks  Nvidia shares have nearly tripled this year. Investors question whether the stock can live up to the hype.  The dot-com bubble taught investors to be wary of stock-market rallies powered by a technological boom—that is, until generative artificial intelligence sent tech stocks soaring this year.  Shares of Nvidia NVDA -0.39%, the graphics-chip maker at the heart of the frenzy, have nearly tripled in 2023, while the Nasdaq-100 has climbed 38% and the S&P 500 has gained 16%.  For some investors, the surge in Nvidia—now the fifth-largest U.S. company by market value—is difficult to chalk up to anything but speculative mania. Its weighting in the benchmark stock indexes means everyday investors are at the whims of its trajectory, whether they believe in AI’s potential or not.  “There’s a huge boom in AI—some people are scrambling to get exposure at any cost, while others are sounding the alarm that this will end in tears,” said Kai Wu, founder and chief investment officer of Sparkline Capital. “Investors can benefit from innovation-led growth, but must be wary of overpaying for it.”  Nvidia is the primary producer of semiconductors backing artificial-intelligence systems. The company forecast a record $11 billion in sales for the recently ended quarter when it reported results in May, catching analysts off guard with the projected surge in customer demand.  “That’s when the excitement around AI really ramped up,” said Ryan McCormack, an Invesco senior exchange-traded fund strategist.   The hype has driven companies such as Meta Platforms and Amazon.com that have been building out AI capabilities, he said. Shares of the tech giants are up 154% and 65% in 2023, respectively. Microsoft, which has climbed 35%, has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a chatbot that can answer difficult questions in seconds.  The furious rally in those stocks, long the market’s biggest drivers, has fanned worries about market concentration. The 10 biggest stocks in the S&P 500 now comprise more than a third of the market, according to Dow Jones Market Data. They represented 27% of the index at the start of the year and less than a quarter in 2000.  “The market story that rhymes most with the internet bubble is the concentration of leadership,” said Mike Edwards, deputy chief investment officer of Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers.  Nvidia’s second-quarter earnings report, due Aug. 23, will provide insight into whether its inexorable rise is well-rooted in demand for chips, or a product of hype. The stock gained 24% in the trading session after its earnings reported in May, and 14% the day following February’s results.  Investors are paying up for the shares, betting on a windfall down the line. Nvidia is trading at 41 times its sales from the last 12 months, according to FactSet, compared with 2.4 times sales for the S&P 500. On a forward basis, the stock trades at 20 times its expected sales for the year ahead—double its average over the last decade of 10 times, according to Dow Jones Market Data.   The nascency of AI programs such as ChatGPT means it is likely too early to determine whether Nvidia can raise revenue in line with the eye-watering valuation investors have slapped on its shares. If the company’s growth isn’t enough to reflect its price, the stock could crater.  A basket of 43 high-multiple internet stocks—those worth at least $5 billion that traded at 25 times their revenue at the turn of the century—crashed 80% over the next two years, according to Sparkline.   The companies weren’t duds, either. Their sales grew 10-fold in the ensuing two decades. But investors were badly bruised from the bust: The shares returned an average of 16% in that time span. The S&P 500 returned 284%.  The basket included Amazon and Microsoft, both darlings of today’s market, along with Cisco Systems, then one of the largest companies in the Nasdaq-100. The networking- equipment maker traded as high as 38 times its sales in early 2000. Cisco has returned 43% since the start of the century—it is down 0.4% when excluding dividends.  “Valuations matter,” said Wu. “Investing in stocks exposed to rapidly growing technologies only works if the growth is not already priced in. Unfortunately, in periods of euphoria, the market has a tendency not only to price in potential growth, but to greatly overextrapolate it.”  One reason why this rally might lack the boom-and-bust nature of the dot-com bubble: The beneficiaries of artificial intelligence were the stocks already shining this year. Investors were flocking to big tech in the first quarter, seeking shelter in strong balance sheets and cash flows.  Tech companies are also benefiting from the expected end of the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate campaign and resilient consumer spending. Cyclical sectors of the broader market have begun to catch up now that recession fears are fading.   “It’s not like 1999 when investors were racing to hot IPOs for companies that had no chance of making money,” said Edwards. “Today’s winners are disciplined, enormous companies that have moats in place and data sets to exploit.”";"5";"2023-08-11T14:53:17"
"Amazon breaks into Europe 5G networks with Telefonica cloud deal";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cmyn3k/amazon_breaks_into_europe_5g_networks_with/";"STOCKHOLM, May 8 (Reuters) - Telefonica Germany (TEF.MC) will move one million 5G customers to Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud later this month, company executives told Reuters, in a bold move by the U.S. online retailer to break into the global telecoms market.  While some telecom networks have moved IT and other non-core operations to the public cloud, the move by the subsidiary of Spanish group Telefonica is a global first where an existing mobile operator is switching its core network to a public cloud.  Big cloud-computing services firms such as Amazon (AMZN.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) have been trying to move more into the telecoms sector, lured by billions of dollars in potential revenue, but operators have been wary of the capability of public clouds in handling a mobile network.  ""I want to see it working for at least one to two quarters and have a roadmap to move at least 30-40% of my customer base by 2025-2026,"" said Mallik Rao, Chief Technology & Information Officer at O2 Telefonica, also known as Telefonica Germany.  The company has 45 million customers in Germany.  AWS and O2 Telefonica did not disclose financial details of the deal.  The core network, which consists of high-performance servers in data centers, is the heart of a mobile network that securely routes data and calls at high speeds. A public cloud will cut costs, increase scale and allow repairs to be done without service disruption.  U.S.-based Dish (DISH.MX), which built its mobile network from scratch, became in 2021 the only telecom company to use AWS cloud for core network.  ""Dish was much easier because they had no existing systems that had to be modified to work with the cloud,"" AWS vice president Jan Hofmeyr said in an interview.  Nokia, which also worked with Dish, will provide the software and AWS will provide its infrastructure for Telefonica.  Telefonica first worked with AWS and Ericsson, and then swapped to Nokia and AWS, Rao said. ""The days of trial are over. I don't want to keep on trying.""  The global telecom cloud market is expected to reach $108.7 billion by 2030 from $19.7 billion in 2021, making it a growth driver for companies such as Amazon.  ""We want to make it a business to run telco workloads,"" AWS' Hofmeyr said, adding that the company expects more deals with other operators in the next 12 months.  ""I would say in most cases the discussion is about timing versus should we move into the cloud.""

"Japanese Game Publisher Behind Monster Hunter Sees 1,200% Gain Over Decade - Bloomberg";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15adgjt/japanese_game_publisher_behind_monster_hunter/";"While the gaming world fixates on the implications of a Microsoft-Activision deal and AI, a smaller player in their universe may deserve a closer look from investors.Japanese game publisher Capcom Co.’s shares are up by a third this year, outpacing the broader Tokyo market and capping off a remarkable 1,200% surge over the past decade. That’s in part because the $11 billion company has punched well above its weight, spawning Hollywood franchises such as Resident Evil and Monster Hunter.   The rally means Capcom, which reports earnings Wednesday, is trading at valuations well in excess of many of its biggest rivals from Konami Group Corp. to Bandai Namco Holdings Inc. It’s doing so despite lagging peers in the smartphone gaming arena, which now makes up half the industry’s sales. Of analysts covering the company, 7 rate it a hold and 10 a buy, with one sell.  Capcom is somewhat of an oddity in the $200 billion gaming industry. About 70% of its sales come from games released in the previous fiscal year or earlier, an unusually high proportion for an industry typically driven by new content, art and adventures. That’s helped the Osaka-based firm break the cycle of earnings volatility that depends on big new releases by capitalizing heavily on its back catalog of games, analysts said.   Tapping underserved and developing markets, such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, with heavily discounted classic games has paid off. The profit margin on a $10 sale of an old game is effectively 100%, as all development costs have already been accounted for in earlier years.   “Capcom has an extremely high operating profit margin and ROI which you can’t really find elsewhere, even outside Japan,” UBS Securities analyst Kenji Fukuyama said. Its gross margin is consistently better than peers, with last year’s 58.6% mark overshadowing Square Enix Holdings Co. (51.2%), Konami (38.9%) and Bandai Namco (37.2%).   The firm sells software in 230 countries and regions, by far the largest number among Japanese publishers, according to Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda. It’s set a goal of selling 100 million copies per year, from the 41.7 million mark it set in the fiscal year ended March.  Capcom was early to convert its older console hits into digital downloads for PCs, and that’s helped it realize the lucrative strategy it relies on today, Fukuyama said. It’s also helped smooth out the massive swings in profits that business models relying on a constant flow of major new hits produce, making Capcom an investor darling.   The stock is now the priciest in its peer group, when comparing enterprise value to earnings, but investors can’t find an off-ramp when growth has been so remarkably consistent, Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc. analyst Junko Yamamura said. The company grew its operating profit for the tenth straight year in March, reporting an 18% rise to ¥50.8 billion ($360 million). Symbols - CCOEY, CCOEF";"83";"2023-07-26T20:21:03"
"Wouldn't it be much more logical to swing trade in Roth IRA's and long-term hold in regular accounts instead of the exact opposite?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16a1qom/wouldnt_it_be_much_more_logical_to_swing_trade_in/";"Wait a second before you have a meltdown over this. Hear me out, then tell me that I'm a dumbass.  It's my belief that most people turn into the Boglehead types over time because of their experiences with paying taxes on short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains. Newer investors don't have the experience with dealing with their taxes as much, so they tend to swing for the fences with shorter-term positions.  More seasoned investors tend to buy and hold, but this is a learned behavior because they know that their absolute worst case tax scenario on a long-term gain is 20 percent (federally). Of course, you only pay the 20 percent on long-term cap gains if you're income is over like 492k or something. Most end up paying about 15 percent federal tax on their long-term cap gains. Short-term cap gains seem to be taxed almost double that amount, obviously it depends on your exact tax bracket situation, but you get the point.  Thus, it's been beaten into the heads of seasoned investors that it's just smarter in the long run to hold positions for at least a year, because your tax bill is often cut in half, or almost in half. You do this long enough, and it becomes ingrained in your investing personality.  All of this makes perfect sense to me.  Ok, now let's talk about Roth IRA's. With Roth IRA's, if you're doing things correctly, there's ZERO taxes on your earnings when you're taking your money out. Obviously you need to be 59 1/2 years old and you need to have passed the 5-year rule, etc., etc.  But if ultimately there's no tax implications whatsoever for investments that are under the Roth umbrella, why do most people tend to hold things for the long-term, and be ultraconservative?  **WAIT!**  I already know what you're going to say, but I'm going to argue that it's nonsensical. You're going to say because Roth IRA's are designed for retirement, and when you get up to that age you should be a lot more risk adverse, because you really need this money for your retirement and you can't be screwing around, taking penitentiary chances.  However, here's my argument to that. Consider all of your investments, Roth and normal brokerages as this large bucket of water. Most ~~people~~ investors will have a Roth account and a regular brokerage account. Due the limitations on how much you can get into a Roth each year, it's likely that most people will have at least 5 to 6 times as much money in their regular brokerage accounts as their Roth accounts. For example.... Imagine somebody has 50k grand total in various Roth accounts. Maybe a standard issue Roth and a 401k Roth. But they have 250k in a ""normal"" brokerage account.  In this scenario, less than 17 percent of their overall investment money is in their Roth. So, the argument that they need to be ULTRA CAREFUL WITH THEIR ROTH MONEY is pretty illogical, because it's such a small percentage of their overall scenario.  **Wouldn't it be tremendously more logical to actually trade that 17 percent of their account more aggressively, when it's the only 17 percent that isn't negatively affected by moving in and out of stocks?**  Think about the guy that has Microsoft stock. Been holding MSFT for years. He knows the ups and downs. The peaks and valleys. He can probably tell you countless times he would have taken profits if only there wasn't a major tax consequence. So, he doesn't take profits when the stock gets ahead of itself, and then buy back in during a retracement. But his reasoning is tax implications. Inside a Roth, there's no tax implications. Thus, this same investor could sell out of MSFT when he thinks it's gotten ahead of itself, and then buy back in during a retracement and end up with more overall shares. All with no taxable implications whatsoever.  Now obviously, nobody can predict the future and sometimes people are going to get it wrong. They'll sell MSFT when they think the stock has gotten way ahead of itself and then it continues to go on a tear and now he can't buy back in and still have the same number of shares.  But by the same token, just talk to any Amazon investor over the last three years. That shit has basically gone pretty much nowhere for a three-year period. So the whole buy and hold forever strategy hasn't worked out that great for AMZN holders.   It cuts both ways. Don't just cherry pick the example of it hurting.";"97";"2023-09-04T21:40:02"
"Is Novo Nordisk (NVO) going to develope anti-obesity semaglutide or put it on the shelf?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14ekl9m/is_novo_nordisk_nvo_going_to_develope_antiobesity/";"It seems some companies invent something and then put it on the shelf because they don't want other products or services to lose sales. NVO maybe developing a version of semaglutide to treat obesity that seems to work and prevent other very serious diseases that are very expensive to treat. Semaglutide has become very popular and sales of NVO's semaglutide in the USA are increasing and NVO can't keep up with production.  It was announced weeks ago that NVO is cutting it's advertising of their Wegovy version of semaglutide because their production can't keep up with demand. Yet, NVO is not saying much about expanding production. It looks to me like NVO isn't making an effort to develop their version of semaglutide.  I really wonder if NVO has put the product on the shelf because a lot of money is made off of obesity and many diseases related to obesity such as diabetes and heart diseases. I believe NVO could be like the next Microsoft or Apple is they'd make a serious effort to increase the production of semaglutide. Most people in the USA will be overweight or obese if a product such as semaglutide isn't developed and made available in the USA.  If VNO is putting semaglutide on the self, it seems we ought to have the right to take matters into our own hands. Companies in the USA should be given approval to develop versions of semaglutide because preventing obesity would save lives.  Apparently NVO is trying to [sue](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/novo-nordisk-sues-spas-wellness-clinics-selling-counterfeit-weight-loss-drugs-2023-06-20/), but they are not saying much about an effort to increase the production of semaglutide.  So I hope it will be ruled that we can do something about obesity that works: Develop our own versions of semaglutide.  Disclusure: I don't know whether or not to buy NVO ADR.";"4";"2023-06-20T21:30:19"
