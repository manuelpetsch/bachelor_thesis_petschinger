"The NYTs is suing Microsoft and I think there is a profitability play on their stocks";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18t0ss4/the_nyts_is_suing_microsoft_and_i_think_there_is/";"What Happened Headlines yesterday were championed by the largest copyright lawsuit in the Manhattan Federal Court: The New York Times sues Microsoft and OpenAI. The copyright infringement lawsuit against the companies says that both used the newspaper’s content to train their models without permission. In doing so, the companies jeopardized Time’s business in its entirety. The Times also suggested in the filing that both companies should be liable for BILLIONS of damages. What prompted the lawsuit? Failed negotiations between the involved parties over the usage of Times material. They also stated they were worried about AI attributing false information to the newspaper. I guess when money is on the line news outlets decide to worry about whether their information is accurate or not. Now here is the real kicker - the Times is calling for both OpenAI and Microsoft to destroy all chatbots that use Times material. With OpenAI’s valuation, currently over $80 bn, coming almost completely from ChatGPT, this could compromise the integrity of the entire company.   The Simple Sides (My) Take The bad news is that I am not a legal professional and truly have no idea how this will go. While I do hold my own opinions, I have reached out to multiple lawyers to get more professional opinions and will be sure to add them here when they respond. In the meantime let’s jump into a couple of completely feasible outcomes.   The entire lawsuit is kaput: a.k.a, insignificant or thrown out  To me, this lawsuit is somewhat of a joke: “Newspaper upset that companies use articles available online.” I honestly DO NOT think the lawsuit will amount to much. It seems like journalists at the Times are worried that they are going to lose money and jobs to AI and aren’t happy about it - rightfully so. However, being scared and upset about AI replacing you isn’t a good reason to cry out to the long arm of the law. When the case gets underway it will be interesting to see the arguments presented by the legal team for the Times.   The New York Times wins the lawsuit If the Times wins the lawsuit it could be a major step in journalism’s fight against AI. Not only would the victory set a legal precedent for future AI copyright cases, but it would mean significant damages being paid to the Times. They (the Times) could come into billions of dollars, possibly boosting the stock (ticker: NYT) to 52-week highs. This could also lead to a revaluation of the AI industry. If websites can “charge” for AI models training on their information, the profitability scales might shift. The more content you have online the more you could capitalize on AI models. AI companies are also not heavily regulated at the moment. A win for the Times could shift lawmakers’ attention to the growing market sector.  Microsoft and OpenAI win the lawsuit  Similar to if the Times won, there would be a legal precedent set - AI models can be trained on any information. This could also reinforce the current AI industry and lead to possible growth in valuations for AI-invested stocks. The New York Times would also likely experience some negative effects, possibly paying lawyer fees for both defendants. In layman’s terms, Microsoft stock would be soaring up and the New York Times would be diving down.   Stock Movements Based on Lawsuit Outcomes We see the MSFT and NYT stocks moving in all sorts of directions depending on the outcome of the pending lawsuit. No need to worry, you’re reading The Simple Side, so we’re gonna break it down for you. If nothing happens and the lawsuit is thrown out then Microsoft might suffer some residual damage from the negative headlines, but the stock price will remain relatively steady. If the New York Times wins then its stock will likely jump up probably both in the short and mid-term, but Microsoft will likely have a significant short-term drop. If Microsoft wins then its stock will jump in both the short and mid-to-long-term, whereas the Times stock will drop in the short term and likely recover within the mid-term.  Could capitalize using options trade strategies. I wrote a full article about this and the profitability of the trades but out of respect for the “no promotion” sub guidelines I can’t post links.

"Collaboration Alert: MSFT and OpenAI Launch $100 Billion Supercomputer Venture";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1br2kat/collaboration_alert_msft_and_openai_launch_100/";"ARTICLE TLDR: Microsoft and OpenAI are reportedly collaborating on a massive data-center project estimated to cost up to $100 billion. The initiative includes the development of an artificial intelligence supercomputer named ""Stargate."" While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI. The focus of the current phase is on procuring AI chips necessary for the subsequent phases.

"Nvidia reminds me of Cisco during dotcom.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/193x11g/nvidia_reminds_me_of_cisco_during_dotcom/";"**Note**: This post is *descriptive* of my personal observations and is for discussion purposes only. It is neither *predictive* in what will happen next nor is it *prescriptive* in suggesting any course of investment actions.   I've only done [3 predictive posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/s/pAtSiWhCXo) on this sub and this won't be one of them.  For those who are too young to remember that time:  There was this new thing called ""the Internet"", and it was going to forever change the world (it eventually did), and every company that hypes up some sort of ""internet tech"" (could be simple landing page that sells stuff, i.e Pets.com) received sky high valuation.   And there was one company behind it that made it all possible: Cisco, the company that sells industrial routers and switches to telecom providers that power the backbone of the entire internet infrastructure, was *obviously* a company that was ""selling shovels during a gold rush"" and would take over the whole world.   Its share price went up 236% from Jan.1999 to March 2000, reached a valuation of $500B+ (record high for a company back then), P/E went through the roof but it didn't matter because the *Internet Revolution^TM* was *just beginning* (and it was), so naturally Cisco's share price could only go higher.  The cherry on the top was that back then the **top two** companies were *Microsoft* and *Cisco*, one would provide the software (**Internet Explorer baby!**) and the other would sell the hardware. Together they would rule the world!  Now if you replace ""Internet"" with ""AI"", and ""Cisco"" with ""Nvidia"", keep Microsoft as it is (but replace ""IE"" with ChatGPT""), and we have quite a mirror version of what's happening today.  Then we all know what happened. Cisco obviously survived the bubble burst and remains profitable and is still doing fine today, but $CSCO *never* recovered back to its dotcom bubble peak after crashing 80% during the dotcom bust, 23 years later.  Now will the same thing happen with $NVDA? Like I said I don't know and I'm not making any predictions. All I can say is that I see a lot of parallels *so far*.  **Edit**: For people replying to me arguing how you can't mine Bitcoins using network switches or how Cisco didn't do AI, *no kidding*, at no point did I claim the two companies are identical and sell the same things, that would be idiotic.  All I am saying is the *hype*, *expectation*, and *position* of these two companies in their respective backdrop, are *similar* to each other.";"409";"2024-01-11T09:39:35"

"I'm ready to make a prediction.
";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1azbrf7/im_ready_to_make_a_prediction/";"The bubble will pop.  We're in a very similar place to the tech bubble. Back then the bubble popped because companies didn't produce revenue to match the hype.  Today this seems different because some companies are making money hand over fist. However, the companies making money are those producing the infrastructure for AI, we have yet to see much revenue generated from AI itself. The similarity is that we are expecting AI itself to generate revenue similar to the startups of the first tech bubble.   Whether or not AI can generate revenue is a different topic. I'll simply say that the current expectations of AI don't match reality. Feel free to list the companies and products that leverage AI that are also generating significant revenue directly from that AI.  Nvidia makes chips, Microsoft and others use these chips to provide AI infrastructure, the bubble is in everyone trying to use this infrastructure to create products that derive revenue. If that revenue doesn't materialize, demand will drop for infrastructure and correspondingly for chips.  Nvidia, Microsoft, and others making money hand over fist is great for them, but it is not an indicator of the actual success of AI, only the attempt at success. Can anyone say Aeron chair?

I‘m not sure how I feel about this. Before today, the Dow was the last of the 3 major U.S. large-cap indices with less (relatively speaking) concentration in tech. “Big Tech” now makes up 30% of the S&P 500 and even more of the NASDAQ-100.  The Dow Jones now includes 3 of the 6 companies (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon) usually considered as Big Tech, plus cloud software provider Salesforce, as well as 3 legacy tech companies (IBM, Intel, Cisco.)

Since Technology makes up 50% of QQQM, is it safe to say that QQQM performance is driven mainly by the technology sector?

VGT is 50% Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia.   If you make up a portfolio of Apple+Microsoft+nvidia, you will see a matching correlation again with VGT and QQQM only an even higher performance than VGT.

Apologies if this has already been posted in this community.   I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ.  https://archive.is/20231009181337/https://www.wsj.com/articles/picking-a-stock-for-the-year-2048-66d90e  The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.  So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold.   So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049.   Here is my list so far.   1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 ) 2. Costco 3. Johnson and Johnson 4. Waste Management 5. CVS 6. Home Depot 7. Boeing 8. Caterpillar 9. GE Aerospace 10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia 11. Walmart/Target 12. Starbucks / McDonalds 13. UPS 14. JP Morgan / Bank of America 15. Berkshire / Markel 16. Disney 17. Tesla / GM 18. Hershey 19. Dollar General 20. Lockheed Martin  Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate.   Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.  Edit: Some really good points in the comments.   1. Most of my regular investing goes to VOO. Think of this as a fun little experiment  2. Since all of these are mature large companies, maybe it makes more sense to go with mid cap stocks. In that case, what would you pick?";"127";"2024-01-18T22:13:00"

Even following the recent market adjustment, **Apple** boasts a valuation exceeding $2.6 trillion, with **Microsoft** at $2.34 trillion, and **Alphabet** at $1.56 trillion.  How can this be? **Don't large tech firms also face the threat of economic downturns?**  Indeed, they do. However, the members of the MAMAA conglomerate (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet) took proactive measures to prepare for a potential economic slowdown by decreasing spending, which included a **reduction in labor costs**...  The recent **turbulence in the U.S. banking sector** has further funneled funds into the tech industry. Investors have shown a preference for companies boasting substantial profit margins and large cash reserves over more traditional safe-haven assets.  Another factor driving growth has been the **surge in Artificial Intelligence**. Investors anticipate that the capital injected into this sector will yield increased sales and, subsequently, elevated profits. Microsoft, for instance, anticipates a 6.7 percent revenue increase in the current quarter due to the rising demand for AI solutions.  Heading into 2023, the IT sector strikes a somewhat subdued chord: the Nasdaq Index suffered a decline of almost 33% in 2022. However, with **decreasing inflation** and the **prospect of a pause in Fed rate hikes**, tech stocks have regained their allure.  One also should not forget to note that key support propping up Nasdaq members was **stock buybacks**. Recall, too, that both Alphabet and Apple recently announced buybacks amounting to $70 billion and $90 billion respectively. Additionally, Meta, formerly Facebook, announced a stock buyback of $40 billion.  What lies on the horizon? **What are the analysts' predictions?**  Michael Landsberg, Chief Investment Officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management, asserts that [large tech stocks are currently overvalued](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/megacap-tech-stocks-out-of-control-big-tech-still-has-the-power-to-extend-the-rally-and-weather-an-economic-storm-analysts-say-a60b6bc3).

Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run.

[The average cost of 1 query from a used is 4 cents](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/).     A single user runs 2,000 queries per month on average. The query is a single text message you send to the chatbot.      2000 \* 0.04 = 80 $ to service 1 user per month.    Until the OpenAI level of efficiency improves they will be losing 70$ to service 1 user per month.    No wonder OpenAI has closed its ChatGPT Plus subscription.  It doesn't seem sustainable.     Last note,  the majority of data centers upgrade their equipment every 4-5 years. So, if AI expectations won't burst, and chip efficiency improves 10-fold, and other chip makers won't catch up, don't expect big tech to re-stock their chips earlier than the end of 2027.      &#x200B:";"3";"2024-01-21T23:17:52"

Seems like Zoomers are breaking up with online dating, preferring the old-school charm of meeting in person.     *YTD Share Performance of Major Dating Apps:*   \- Grindr: +25%   \- Match Group: -28%   \- Bumble: -32%   \- Spark Networks: -98%     **Take-Aways:** I’m no expert on the dating apps (I’ve been with my wife since I was a pimple-faced school boy) but think there is a broader theme that investors need to be cautious of: that things trendy with the twentysomethings can evaporate quite quickly.     *Performance Since IPO of Select 'Trendy Stocks':*   \- Snapchat: -58%   \- Robinhood: -77%   \- GoPro: -91%   \- Allbirds: -97%   \- Blue Apron: -99%     Companies like GoPro and Snapchat were all extremely popular at one time but things change - and often quickly. A key term for investors is that of a ‘moat’: characteristics ingrained in your business model that makes it hard for competitors or copy-cats to come along and steal your market share. While things like a company’s ‘brand’ can be an example of a moat, ‘popularity’ isn’t the same thing. Brands are built over years from their connection to things like quality (Volvo), trustworthiness (Wall Street Journal) or coolness (Hermes).     *Examples of Economic Moats:*     * **Low-Cost Producers:** Provide a low cost that is usually based on significant economies of scale. Examples include Walmart, Southwest, FedEx. * **High Switching Costs:** Material expense (money, time, effort) required in order to move to competitor. Examples include Salesforce, Oracle, Microsoft. * **Network Effect:** Value to customer increases with the number of people on the platform. Examples include Ebay, Uber, Reddit. * **Intangible Assets:** Brand names, intellectual property, trade secrets, government approvals. Examples include Pfizer, Nvidia, Coca-Cola.     Moreover, often these companies that achieve near overnight success do so because their business doesn’t require significant time, expense or technological sophistication in order to reach such a scale. Looking at the companies I've mentioned, in nearly every case some smart folks with a laptop can replicate their business model: improve on it: and steal their customers. In essence, the things that can be built quickly, are often built on sand.   ";"316";"2023-11-13T18:46:24"
"Nvidia is the ‘Magnificent One’ now — but these rivals are closing in";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aymstx/nvidia_is_the_magnificent_one_now_but_these/";"I’ve been accused of being a booster for Nvidia.

Okay. Rah rah. But what about the competition? That much money and someone(s) are gonna try and steal a piece and poach your employees.

It’s fun to be right and more fun to be right in good company. But what if everyone is wrong? Isn’t it this type of mania and exuberance that should give the market pause?   > Nvidia has effectively grown to more than 98% of the market for data-center graphics processing units, or GPUs, due to a complete lack of meaningful competition. This early lead has given the company unbounded pricing power, driving its margins in the most recent quarter to over 76%.  > over the past few months we have seen signs of competition entering the market. This will affect Nvidia’s margins and the company’s ability to continue to grow at such a staggering rate.   > the competition is coming from an array of places [in addition to AMD who is predicting $4B for their new GPU] that include a number of Nvidia’s largest and most important customers. For example, Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS cloud has its AI chips for training and inference, Microsoft recently announced its Maia AI chip, and Alphabet Inc.’s Google continues to innovate on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Oracle Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also developing AI chips in house.   > not as much an indictment on Nvidia as they are a realization by these companies that overdependence on a single source for AI semiconductors is a risk  > In short, competition is real and it is coming to Nvidia in a meaningful way.

Instead of buying an S&P 500 ETF like SPY or VOO, we’d buy a “direct index” of the S&P 500. It’s all automatically done, and the software buys the underlying stocks of the S&P 500 and constantly rebalances and finds capital losses. For example, if Microsoft is down, the algorithm sells it to buy something else that is correlated within the index, and comes back into Microsoft 30 days later.  Basically:  * It tracks the index very closely, pretty much just as good as SPY or VOO * It generate 45% of the investment amount in capital losses over 10 years, with the bulk of that in the first 5 years * The capital losses are used to shield against capital gains * The tax savings from saved capital gains dollars are reinvested back into the direct index, generating on average 2% more than without itI  I modeled it out here      [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tnf-iW6u1iOfkb6tjX3O863MPzd4QoFrcJ6liGC\_vKs/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tnf-iW6u1iOfkb6tjX3O863MPzd4QoFrcJ6liGC_vKs/edit#gid=0)   Anyone consider direct indexing before?

I'm curious about the investment strategy of buying high when it's a good company.  For examples, look at Microsoft, Amazon, Eli Lilly, and Nvidia.  All at very high points.  Hitting new all time highs even.  In theory, my heart says if you truly believe in the company and that the stock will go up, then buying high isn't a problem.  But my brain is just like, NO, it'll clearly go down.  You never buy high lol.  So what do YOU all do?  Do you have a favorite stock that you buy more of no matter how high it gets? Or do you just enjoy the ride with what you have and look for something else to invest in?  I do have some small positions in those four companies, which is why I'm familiar with them. Clearly I'm comfortable enough with them to hold the shares I have. But my brain is just so wired to not buy high at peaks.  I've read a decent amount of different strategies and things to look for, but I've never really seen anything about a successful company and buying high.  I know it could be a little subjective too. Depends on your age and risk tolerance and things like that and what you are looking for, but I guess I'm just trying to go for a more General approach in this question.

"Gene Munster - Dan Nathan - Other Bear Nvidia Analysts Get This One Thing Wrong. There will be NO Glut Or Epic Fall - Nvidia is Now a Cloud Provider of Accelerated Compute";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1axqdrd/gene_munster_dan_nathan_other_bear_nvidia/";"Gene was giving a great analysis of Nvidia potential headwinds into the future of this AI Super Cycle.      <video here>      The problem is I don't think these analyst are getting how Nvidia works which is weird because they literally have direct access to Jensen.      I think the word ""Data Center"" is confusing. I think they believe that data center means something that is not cloud like but rather a super computer that is shipped to someone who then uses it in the cloud. And that's it they ship the hardware and Nvidia never sees them again.      That's not what is going on here.      First, Nvidia can direct sell you cloud like access to all their hardware and software services all by themselves.      NVIDIA DGX Cloud is a serverless, AI-training-as-a-service platform for enterprises that depend on AI.      With integrated best-in-class software, direct access to NVIDIA AI experts, and near-limitless access to high-performance compute, DGX Cloud delivers industry-leading utilization efficiency with scale and productive work capacity for developers—at the lowest TCO compared with traditional infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) approaches.      Dan Nathan just seems either confused or just willfully attempting to rally a short position. I lean to the latter because I can't believe he is actually believing what he is saying but I could be wrong.      Maybe Dan is just confused.      Second, You can then access Nvidia with all of it's software and services FROM effectively a third party such as Azure or AWS. Why would someone go this route? The reason is many times companies have contracts in place to get discounted compute from 1 or 2 cloud providers. So, they sort of go all in with Microsoft Azure as an example. The legal and contract agreements are in place for the entire IT department to use ""whatever"" is in Azure. Well, if Nvidia cloud can be accessed in Azure that's great because all of the engineers and DS's can have access without going through and getting agreements in place for Nvidia directly.      There is obviously the chance of more cost but for the lack of headache it is probably negligible. But, every situation is different. Point is, that is money that is going directly to Nvidia (and probably the serving cloud provider at some portion) because at that point Microsoft or AWS or Google is only a passthrough. This is very much the same for other provider as well such as MongoDB and Redis Labs.      Now, on the other side Microsoft, X and AWS have every right to purchase, store and assemble their own solutions with purchased hardware from Nvidia and others and also provide and direct sale their own option.      See that's the difference of HARDWARE sales and CLOUD INCOME. I haven't heard this on the conference calls and would be great if someone talked about it because it would become so much more clear. You must understand the distinction to understand Nvidia's current business model right now.      Back to Gene. So the the mistake that everyone keeps making is that they're saying the BUST or the apocalypse MUST come for nvidia because once they sale all of the hardware then nobody is going to buy anymore. Thus the ""GLUT"".      That's not how this is working. You have to get your mind out of the Crypto/NFT ponzi scheme to understand this.      Crypto had a bunch of GPU's going up against a supply / demand model of increasing BitCoin price. When the bitcoin price crashed. Everyone holding a warehouse of GPU's costing millions in electricity suddenly didn't want to be a bitcoin miner anymore. Hence, a bunch of GPU's that nobody wanted. The ""GLUT"". This was probably max of Bitcoin falling to \~12000. It's also why ETH and others wanted to go to ASICS and get off the Bitcoin hype cycle.      Nobody talks about AWS or Azure or Google's ""GLUT"" concern with bought servers and hardware. Nobody. AWS and Azure update their cloud server options all of the time. It's a natural cycle that is smooth and calculated.      Why is it not conceivable that this will be similar for Nvidia?      Everyone is trying to predict the day Nvidia falls instead of trying to think ""hmm"" maybe, just maybe, Nvidia is growing as a cloud offering with software, hardware and service. Sound like IaaS? Because it is.      It's the same concept as general compute but with accelerated compute. The software stack is why you would go for Nvidia as opposed to using a different cloud provider native abstraction.      MongoDB in Azure Cosmos is not as good as MongoDB direct to Mongo IN Azure. Or at least that might be a consideration for you.      Speaking of Data storage companies one could make an analogy here.      Data gets stored and then you access said data.      LLM's get trained and then you access said LLM.      The only difference is that the LLM needs compute to run it. Less than training compute but still accelerated compute.      The training doesn't happen one time and that's it. You could train a model and it suck and then you have to retrain it. Or you need to update it so you have to retrain it.      The money it cost to train is in the million's. multiple millions of dollars for foundational LLM's.      There will be no more glut here than there is in any other cloud providers for general compute.      There will not be a ""BUST"" this time. So don't worry Dan, you can come out of the shorts and join the rest of us into the future.";"8";"2024-02-23T04:23:52"

The final list of named trends we researched was:   \-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.   \-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.   \-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.   \-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestlé, L'Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.   \-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.   \-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.   \-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.   \-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce   Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.   From first mention   Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.   For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S&P 500.   The first interesting finding: When we look at the average of all these eight named trends, we see considerable price run-up before the trade being named. For the 24 months before the zero-date, we see the average named trend deliver 36% in excess returns. This means that if you magically knew about a new named trend before it happened, you could earn 36 percentage points above the S&P 500 for the two years before it was named.   Worth the ride, until...   But even if you don't have this magical foresight, it still doesn't hurt to ride a trend once it has been coined. On average, once the trend has been named and looking ahead 12 months, an investor can still earn about 13 percentage points in excess returns.   Yet 12 months following the naming is about the best you can do as returns peak at this point on average and decrease a bit subsequently. From the 12-month mark to the 24-month mark after a trend has been named, the average named trend lags behind the S&P 500 by about 2 percentage points.   When we look at the individual named trends, it might surprise people that the two best trades from the zero-date to the 24-month mark in our sample were the BAT and Cloud trends -- both earning more than 60% in excess return over the two-year period once they were coined by the press.   On the other end, the MT SAAS trade did the worst, dropping more than 95% in excess returns over the two-year period after being named.   All in all, this means your best option is to jump on a named trend as soon as you first hear about it -- provided you haven't been too late to the party -- and ride the initial momentum, if it happens. But if you get in past the 12-month mark, the returns might not be so magnificent.

I sold Nvidia a couple months ago thinking it would reverse after its huge rise and it actually continued to grow until now.   What are your thoughts about this? Should I just hold it all?

You would get that price right? To keep numbers simple, let’s just use 1%.   Now if on Wednesday of that same week it went up 10% and is trending this way to market close and you lock it in before. You would sell it for this price?  And since it’s a Roth IRA there is no tax for even this short of a gain on an individual stock? With how fluctuating some stocks are, what are the obvious and glaring cons to just continuing to repeat this approach.   If say you bought the stock at an even $100 and it trended up to $200 after a few months, and then it started a week long gradual spiral and is at $180 and you decide to sell it then. Wouldn’t you just profit the $80.   Obviously if the company is bankrupt in the short term you invested or never goes positive from the day you invested you lose money.

"The Stigma of Stock Picking";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1al4igr/the_stigma_of_stock_picking/";"Stock picking often gets a bad rap, therefore redditor's often default to suggesting new investors purchase the S&P or any comparable fund. Though this could be considered the safe route, it does little to teach new investors about the market as a whole.   Stock picking is like a dark art, and is something I vowed to learn and master early on (or at least quit losing money in). Firstly, diversification is important. There's no way around it. Your level of diversification can vary, but owning an excessive amount of companies will only assure you'll do average at best.  Many give Cramer flak, but there's one comment he'd often make I'd like to highlight: ""Buy best of the best"". If you opted to buy the best companies per sector, beating the market isn't impossible...but picking stocks is half of the equation. ""Buying a wonderful company at a fair price"" is the other half.  I often stress the psychology of investing. Something I didn't become cognizant of until I started day trading. The market often pulls in new investors during euphoria, and this is the absolute worst time to invest.   Many novice (and somewhat experienced) investors can't stomach market corrections, so be mindful of the affect a correction can have on someone who got in at the highs during euphoric conditions. A 10% drop in a stock isn't something to lose sleep over for someone who's up 100% or so...but imagine the affect a 10% drop can have on a new investor. They'll likely want to stop the bleeding, considering they'll immediately be in the red.   Resist following the herd. Usually when some shiny new thing is being touted on social media, smart money is already looking for the exit. Invest in companies you can understand. Invest in products you already use or would consider using, granted they have sustainable growth. I often avoided shopping at Walmart because it was always crowded. I decided to research the company to determine what that traffic translated to. That was around $52 a share. I realized when you turn on every computer, you were greeted by Microsoft Windows. That was $38 a share. It can be that simple.  Investors definitely shouldn't be deterred from stock picking. Just be cognizant of the business and disciplined in your entry.

"Is an Investment in Nvidia a good idea?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/146t92y/is_an_investment_in_nvidia_a_good_idea/";"Join the discussion and discover the compelling reasons behind this optimistic outlook.  Reasons for NVIDIA Share Increase:  Cutting-edge Technology: NVIDIA is at the forefront of groundbreaking technology, like artificial intelligence (AI) and graphics processing units (GPUs). Here's why it matters: NVIDIA's AI advancements have the power to transform industries such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and data analytics. Their GPUs dominate the gaming market, offering high-performance hardware that gamers love. Strong Partnerships: NVIDIA has formed strategic alliances with major tech giants, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, unlocking exciting opportunities: Collaborations with these influential companies put NVIDIA at the center of emerging technologies like cloud computing and machine learning. NVIDIA's recent acquisition of ARM Holdings gives them an even greater advantage in the semiconductor industry. Expanding into New Markets: NVIDIA's reach extends beyond gaming and AI, entering exciting sectors that are gaining momentum: Cryptocurrency mining has seen a significant surge, increasing the demand for NVIDIA GPUs, which boosts their sales and revenue. NVIDIA's focus on the automotive industry, developing advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technology, positions them as a key player in the future of transportation. Impressive Financial Performance: NVIDIA has a track record of delivering strong financial results, which bodes well for future growth: Consistent revenue and profit growth over the years demonstrate NVIDIA's ability to deliver solid financial outcomes, which may attract more investors. The company's robust cash flow allows for continued investment in research and development, ensuring they stay ahead of the competition.

"Is it easy to “beat the market” now?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1burmr0/is_it_easy_to_beat_the_market_now/";"Short question, if you invest in the top tech companies, is it easy to beat the marketing meaning the S&P?  We’ve all heard the mantra “you’ll never beat the market” but is that really true any more or does the phrase need some sort of updating?  I’ve been investing for 15 years now and I think I be beat the market or at least the overall S&P500 every single year.  There might have been a year that I nominally missed but if you add up all my investments and look at the gains, it’s significantly higher than if I just invested in a boring S&P ETF.  My Fidelity account does this for me automatically and I’ve always been higher…for over a decade now.   So hear me out, I’ve made some dumb mistakes and lost $$$ along the way but my winners have always offset that. My game plan is pretty simple: always invest in large cap stocks.    With a diverse portfolio made up of Microsoft, Nvidia, Facebook (now meta), Amazon, Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, Amd, and a few others, I’ve found this sector completely destroys the overall “market.” Sure I have a few outliers like Home Depot and OLIN but when I look at my pie chart, it’s very aggressive and very heavily in tech.    The difference in the S&P vs the NASDAQ confirms this over the last 20 years or more and you could argue I’ve built my own sort of NASDAQ mutual fund in a ways, but I’m still beating the NASDAQ too.    The contrarian’s argument is that given enough time, my large cap tech picks will eventually falter and I will begin losing but at the amount I’m up right now, for over a decade, that correction would have to be astronomical and I don’t see how the whole world economy wouldn’t fall if these tech picks crash down 50% at once.    I’m not trying to brag or troll this group or anything like that.  I’m just genuinely interested to know if tech has made it relatively easy to now beat the overall market, and if so, what consequences does that have on the stability of the whole market if more investors start doing what I’m doing?    Is there a point where the “market” is all tech now?  It sure feels like the S&P is so heavily weighted by tech now that maybe that’s the real underlying answer to my question.

IPO was 75 dollars, soared around 125 then plummeted.  Currently around 15.  A stop loss could have salvaged the loss at the original 75 price point.  Microsoft stock.

Current holdings in the IRA are Apple and Microsoft. I am interested in taking equal distributions from the IRA for the remainder of the 10 year limit, maxing my own Roth IRA, and potentially reinvesting any additional funds after the max Roth contribution. I’m trying to decide the best investments moving forward.  For additional context, I am 47. I want to retire no later than 62. I will have an estimated pension of about 60% of my pre retirement income at that time, and Social Security will bump that up to maybe 75-80% (though I’m not counting on that in my calculations). I will also have a health insurance subsidy that will cover a large portion of my insurance needs. While it’s late in the game, I have begun contributing to a 457b and plan to begin maxing that every year until retirement. My plan would also be to continue maxing the Roth IRA until retirement, as well as make the catch up contributions after 50.  I have an investment portfolio in addition to the IRA that is currently stacked pretty heavily with NVDA. I plan to hold NVDA long term, but possibly sell and reinvest some at some point.  I’m leaning towards an index fund in the Roth to balance out the more “risky” holdings in the other account. I do not actively trade and am primarily interested in long term stable growth investments. I’m fairly new to this and wondering if this seems like the right track.

I don't want my entire life's and retirement savings to be 30% dependent on 2 stocks no matter what they are.  I have found many ETFs which buy S&P500 stocks based on various performance indicators. Some are quite speculative which doesn't interest me. But others are based on things such as quality factor, cash flow, volatility, etc.  A couple of examples are MOAT which is based on companies which have a wide moat, or competitive advantage, which would be difficult for competitors to overcome. Another is SPHQ which is based on quality factor.  Both of these ETFs have a 10 year return of higher than the S&P500 despite both being based on S&P stocks. They're just weighted and selected differently. Clearly this has been working and those strategies logically seem like they'd be successful  My question is why are these ETFs and others like them not as popular as the most common bulk, market cap weighted S&P ETFs? Their long term annualized returns obviously made the extra expense ratio worth it for the past decade. Their portfolios logically make sense to me. They do still own a lot of the same stocks just at lower percentages of the overall holdings  This seems like a no-brainer: they are more diversified with better long term track records.

I’ve seen the numbers before, but this really gave me pause.   > These captains of the SS S&P 500 are Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. They've been described as the magnificent seven by many news organizations. Fortunately for me, there's a common thread among this group. They are the only U.S. companies that have ever been valued at a trillion dollars by the public markets. To say these companies are dominating the S&P 500 is a giant understatement. Last year, their collective valuation gained more than $5 trillion. Compare that to the S&P 500's valuation gain of less than $8 trillion. That means the trillionaires were responsible for roughly 65% of the Index's market cap gain last year, despite comprising just 1.4% of its components. But doesn't this go against the main reason behind investing in S&P 500 index funds? Wouldn't the entire index be susceptible to a massive drop if just one of these seven companies failed?  > Phil Van Dorn: Well, I like index funds because they spread out your risk over many stocks and because the expenses are so low. In the mutual fund industry, traditionally, you might be looking at expenses of 1% of assets under management per year, and that can really pile up over time. But with an S&P 500 Index Fund, your expenses get close to zero. But as you have mentioned when you called the group of expensive stocks the Trillionaires' Club, a small group of companies now make up between 27 and 30% of the S&P 500 depending on which day you look at it.  > Jeremy Owens: Right, so that's seven out of 500 companies accounting for more than a quarter or less than a third of the entire market cap of the S&P 500 and really swaying the underlying metrics. What should an investor kind of take from this and how should we look at the S&P 500 moving forward, knowing how much these companies matter?  > Phil Van Dorn: One can say that there's a heck of a lot of risk in the seven companies that make up only 1% of the S&P 500, but make up close to a third of its value. However, the S&P 500 is self-correcting. It rewards success.";"28";"2024-01-20T01:51:08"
"A Fundamental Analysis For a Bull Case on Nokia";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1bomwr2/a_fundamental_analysis_for_a_bull_case_on_nokia/";"# Here's why I believe there is a bull case for Nokia:  1. **Historical Performance and Restructuring:** Nokia has historically faced challenges with sub-par revenue performance, leading to declines in stock price. However, the company's commitment to restructuring indicates proactive efforts to address underlying issues and improve efficiency. 2. **Cost Cutting Measures:** Nokia has implemented cost-cutting measures, aiming to reduce expenses by $1 billion. These measures are expected to enhance profitability by decreasing operational costs and increasing income. 3. **Investment in 6G Technology:** Nokia's significant investment in the development of 6G technology positions it as a frontrunner in the telecommunications sector. This commitment to innovation presents opportunities for future revenue growth and market leadership. 4. Strong Financial Position: Analysis of Nokia's balance sheet reveals a healthy financial position, with a higher cash balance compared to debt. This financial stability provides flexibility for strategic investments and expansion initiatives. 4. **Low Risk Perception:** Relative to other tech stocks in the industry, Nokia is perceived as a low-risk investment. This perception is based on factors such as stable financials, diversified revenue streams, and established market presence. 5. **Strategic Leadership and Talent Acquisition:** Nokia's appointment of Derek Urbaniak, an experienced leader in silicon engineering, signals a strategic move to bolster its technical capabilities. This, along with corporate restructuring, indicates a promising outlook under new leadership. 6. **Market Analyst Consensus:** Despite short-term fluctuations, market analysts widely believe that Nokia's fair value exceeds its current stock price. This consensus suggests potential undervaluation in the market, presenting an opportunity for investors to capitalize on future growth.  # TLDR:  *Nokia's bull case rests on its proactive restructuring efforts, investment in cutting-edge technology, strong financial position, low-risk perception, strategic leadership decisions, and consensus among market analysts regarding its undervaluation. These factors collectively indicate a promising outlook for the company and potential for substantial growth in the future.*";"8";"2024-03-27T00:35:16"

As I am still a rookie in investing I would love some feedback  My method is looking at companies that meet most of the following criteria: gross margin >40%, 5Y ROIC>15%, 5Y ROCE >20%, insider ownership >10%, Capex/sales <5%, net margin >10%, FCF margin >10%, Revenue growth >8%, earnings growth >7%, stock based compensation preferably <10% of operating cash flow. I look for businesses I can understand and I perceive to have a strong moat.  Then I perform a discount cash flow analysis using a discount rate of 15% and an exit free cash flow multiple. I prefer companies with at least 5 year history of free cash flow growth to calculate the expected cash flow growth.

"Which AR company is the ideal investment?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19bd3cv/which_ar_company_is_the_ideal_investment/";"I'll just say first off, I don't think AR is the big investment right now. AI is clearly here now, and AR is maybe 5 years out before some VERY heavy investment. Right now the leaders are Meta and Apple.   Opinions:   Meta Case: Meta's headset makes you look like a cyborg, its very goofy looking compared to the Apple Vision Pro. It's also angled at gaming, which is problematic because none of the major gaming companies have committed to it, meaning until that occurs there is no guarantee that the gaming angle plays out. I imagine programming a VR game is SIGNIFICANTLY more intensive of an investment than required for an xbox game. That said META is not cannibalizing its own sales nearly as much as Apple...  &#x200B:  Apple Case: The vision pro looks much cleaner, as do almost all Apple products. Apple has the wearable tech that will help them make the headset much smaller over time. They are also angled towards business. I just watched the Vision Pro video and frankly it looks like a great product for three reasons: The clean look, the dimming of a room when watching TV/movies which enhances the experience and makes it more convenient. Finally, I think the environment one is very good. I can be doing my work on the vision pro ""literally"" surrounded by Mount Doom's lava and Frodo bringing the ring up to the mountain. The massive con is that the vision pro cannibalizes the iphone and the mac book. As the vision pro gains traction there is immediately less of an incentive for using the iphone and the mac book which make up a big piece of apple's sales.  &#x200B:  What are your thoughts? Right now, my money is in Meta, but after seeing Apple's product I think apple has gone the right direction. Meta is too reliant on the gaming industry and they haven't made it nearly as suitable for wearing it in social situations. No way you're wearing that headset around other people at a party.";"0";"2024-01-20T15:36:41"

"How bad am I screwing this up? ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1chadg2/how_bad_am_i_screwing_this_up/";"I will preface my story by saying I’m in my early 40s, and admitting I’ve only very recently starting saving for my retirement (401k through my work w/ matching) because I didn’t make enough up until very recently to do so. I know. Point taken. I have a very cynical viewpoint that I’ll never be able to retire, being a single income.   I’ve been with my company almost 8 years and they keep giving me RSU awards. I havnt done anything with them, and they keep generating dividends (almost $24k now) which end up in a core position of an account. I just leave them sit because honestly I dont know enough what to do about them. I know lots of people sell their RSU, but looks like they’re generating some good $. So there’s that.   Then about 2 years ago I had about $200k sitting in my checking, bank says “you really should do something with it, how about meeting with one of our investment advisors”. I say, sure. We meet, go over my goals, etc. I tell him I want to save up for a down payment on a house and an emergency fund. He sets me up with 2 different accounts, both invested in mutual funds, one a little riskier than the other, but mutual funds in case I need access to them . At this point I consider this my life savings. Over the course of the year, I watch the accounts lose $60k. I meet with him the following year and tell him I’m extremely unhappy and he makes some adjustments to where I’m no longer hemorrhaging money, but now I feel like I’m simply breaking even. I have not contributed to either account since setting them up.   Out of this, I started learning about investing, strategies, etc. I opened my own brokerage account with Fidelity to apply what I’m learning  about investing, etc, separate from my bank’s investment accounts, and work’s account. I invested in FXAIX, Microsoft, VOO (yes I realize my error after I did so, I’ll address it someday) , a data center REIT stock, and ARCC. With all the rules surrounding Ira’s, I’m concerned that my MAGI won’t let me contribute to my own Ira accounts, so is a regular brokerage still the way to go?    I feel like I’m learning a good bit, but at the same time I feel like I’m getting lost in the weeds. After losing $60k in my mutual funds accounts, I don’t know if I trust my advisor to ask him investing advise.…  I am contributing to my company 401k now, but I was also thinking about opening my own Ira account…   Thoughts/guidance on how bad I’m screwing things up.

"1 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/";"Last year there was a post asking what folks were doing to profit from the current/upcoming recession on Hacker News: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33040211](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33040211)  I replied ([https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33041751](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33041751)) that I purchased some pandemic stocks, which I started doing in April 2022. Most of my purchasing was through summer 2022, but I've bought others more recently, like Carvana on the dip in December (which luckily popped since it became a meme stock), as well as Meta, Amazon and Google on the dips in October. The most recent was Allbirds on the dip in March since I had just purchased the shoes and they quickly became my favorite.  Overall, I'm up 36%, but as you can imagine a few winners (which I luckily have larger stakes in) make up for the losers. My target timeline is \~3 years, and we could still see a deeper recession from a hard landing, so I plan to post more annual updates.  There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I've summarized each with the overall unrealized gain/loss so far as of this morning:  * Affirm: -11.33% * Amazon: +25.25% * Allbirds: +9.43% * Coinbase: -34.32% * Carvana: +306.5% * Google: +29.35% * Meta: +170.89% * Cloudflare: +14.35% * Netflix: +97.08% * Peloton: -54.61% * Roblox: +25.14% * Shopify: +39.26% * Snapchat: +3.21% * Snowflake: +11.14% * Unity: +8.91%  **Some commentary**  It's hard to convey how much of a roller coaster the the last 12 months have been, with some pretty large negative swings that I just had to watch and not react to. There are likely more to come, especially since it seems a lot of the potential good news is already priced in.  Interestingly, in that post I mentioned Peloton was one I regretted almost instantly, and is now my worst performer by far. Unfortunately, greed got the best of me and I caught that falling knife buying a few times as the stock dropped further. I was hoping they would get rid of the excess inventory, improve distribution and double down on subscriptions to turn things around, but that hasn't materialized. Maybe it still will, or they get acquired.  Despite the strong gains, I still feel Shopify (improved focus, strong brand), Netflix (new ad tier, other new streaming services struggling and likely to go back to content), and Meta (improved targeting post privacy changes + AI opportunities) still have good upside potential.  I also really like Microsoft due to their enterprise moat and opportunities with AI, but their stock never had the correction the other stocks did and that was the scent I was chasing at the time (right or wrong). But long-term, I also wonder if AI will negate the need for human productivity software since the AI can just do it and review/edit mode requires less bloat (e.g. video with Final Cut Pro vs. TikTok, or images with Photoshop vs. Instagram). I wouldn't doubt if we see an AI-native productivity suite that doesn't just integrate AI, but predicated on simplfy reviewing AI generated content.  I'm disappointed to have missed Nvidia (up 3X since October) since I used to own it and have been watching it since the crypto bust created excess inventory and a predictable dip, then the AI trend led to the recovery. The valuation feels rich, but could easily grow into it given the trajectory of AI, unless the hyperscalers make their own chips.  Perhaps counterintuitively, it seems it's more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts than financial analysts/stock pickers since, at the end of the day, you need to make your own decisions about the fundamentals and prospects of the business. Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but by definition backward looking while valuation is forward looking.  I'm curious to see how these perform if the US enters a broader recession in the next 18 months. I don't plan to sell unless something catastrophic happens and I see a better opportunity to shift to.  **Update \~6mo later here:** https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15\_year\_followup\_on\_buying\_the\_dip\_on\_pandemic/";"174";"2023-06-12T21:18:14"
"How can I use correlation coefficients to build a portfolio";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1913hfc/how_can_i_use_correlation_coefficients_to_build_a/";"Hi all,  Before starting, I'll just point out that most of my portfolio is index funds and ETFs. But I do have maybe 10-15% in single stocks, just to satisfy the inner (wannabe) Buffett.  So we've all heard the advice that diversification is important when building a portfolio. Correct me if wrong, but this can mean across different stocks, or by diversifying across assets, like stocks and real estate.   I was looking for some online calculator that could find the correlation between two stocks and found this:  https://www.buyupside.com/calculators/stockcorrelationinput.php  It lets you put two stocks and the time period to calculate the correlation between.   Could something like this be used just as a rudimentary tool. Either to see how whether you're actually as diversified as you think or to see you're not over concentrating in one area. Like investing in 5 different popular tech giants, which seems to be a thing some people do.   However, some results I found were a bit strange so not sure if that means using figures like these are not so useful? Eg, apple and Goldman Sachs had a correction of 0.8585 over the past 5 years and 0.9058 over the last 10 years. Or Nvidia and PepsiCo also having a correlation just over 0.85.   Are these figures just because stocks have generally all gone up over these time periods so the end result would be that mathematically they are correlated? Even though they are completely different industries/business models?  So can mathemical concepts/figures like these be useful, or do they not mean much since they are backwards looking, and it's better to diversify by knowledge of the different businesses. Such as, we might say intuitively that Apple and PepsiCo should be uncorrelated, no matter what price history suggests?  A final thought I'd like to hear opinions on, would be choosing from different industries based on the most diversification available.   Eg, you pick Microsoft and apple in the tech sector (not in your portfolio, just as two options available) and PG and PEP in, not sure the exact industry name, but say consumer products? You've done whatever prior research you saw fit to arrive at these businesses and now want to narrow things down for whatever reason.   And then have a 2*2 matrix with the different correlations between pairs. If there is a pair that might have significantly lower correlation than the other three, maybe you could pick that? Or is this still not very useful?";"1";"2024-01-07T22:43:24"

I’m wanting to exit those losing positions hopefully soon and sort out how else to allocate those funds. I will probably have the Roth IRA managed by my retirement company once I exit those positions so I don’t have to worry about it. I’ll also be getting quite the tax harvest from the selling the positions in my brokerage account.   With all the losing positions I sell in my brokerage, I’ll have ~40k of cash to do whatever with.

I’m thinking about taking the $40k I get from my losses and putting it in a HYSA, but not sure that would be the best thing to do. I think it would certainly be much less stressful than investing over $100k myself, but I also don’t think I’ll need the money very soon.   I’m single and currently live in Denver (I hate it here), and would love to be able to go to a warmer place, potentially San Diego if I can afford it. I don’t know much about buying a house nor do I feel confident enough in a city to buy one, so still renting for now. My rent is 2.3k here, and would be much higher in a place like SD. I’m hoping to get a decent raise soon that would be closer to $200k, but not sure if it’s gonna play out yet or not.   Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Please be gentle because I know ARK was a mistake and I’m trying to do the right things now. I’m trying to get out of the mindset of recovering my losses through investments, and would like to be able to live more peacefully and not check the market every day.

"In Defense of Dividends (On a Million $ Portfolio)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15dnfnd/in_defense_of_dividends_on_a_million_portfolio/";"To start with, I'm 41 years old, and have been investing since I was 22. Right now, my portfolio is just around a million dollars - still waiting to get a $87k tax refund from the government. Here's a screenshot of my portfolio:  [https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg)  Edit: The portfolio total is in Canadian dollars. So convert US holdings like SCHD, VOO, IBTG etc from USD to CAD, and the total should add up.  Edit 2: You'll see that I'm not exclusively chasing dividends either. I have VOO, AVUV etc that have pretty poor dividends.  As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I'm not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.  Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about ""young"" investors chasing dividends: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why\_are\_many\_especially\_young\_people\_investing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/)  While I'm not exactly old, I'm not exactly young either. And here's why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.  **The Arguments for Dividends**  *1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money*  No investor thinks that dividends are ""free money"". Obviously money doesn't grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a ""gotcha"", but it's a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?  No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company's assets. So let's get that out of the way.  *2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital*  At a fundamental level, I don't care about stock prices. I care about only two things:  a) What is my income stream?  b) How fast is that income stream growing?  Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person's wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here's a quote from Great Expectations:  **""His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year""**  In his book ""The Four Pillars of Investing"", Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.  For me, I don't care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you're poor. At least for me. Doesn't matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.  *3. Dividends ARE From a Company's Earnings*  For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don't use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn't hard to understand.  *4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth*  Here's the big one. The theory goes that companies that don't pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn't want that?  Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. **That money was yours**. It's human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.  For a company to retain dividends, they need to *generate a higher return than their own current cashflow*. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That''s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they're promising that they'll get even *more* profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that's your gamble to make.  *5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow*  When you re-invest your dividends, you're purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven **they can already generate**. It's not pie-in-the-sky ""trust me bro"" cashflow. You know the company's track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You're buying more of the same. It's more secure.  *6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock*  The English used to have a saying:  **""Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!""**  People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.  For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It's stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.  *7. When a Company Fails, All You're Left with is Dividends*  Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it's in distress and that shareholders won't get the value of the company's assets, so that's a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.  Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.  *8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin*  What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.  What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.  *9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation*  The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:  Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.  For example, Microsoft's yield is low. But it's growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.  **Bottom Line**  No one denies that companies need to retain *some* earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company's cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.  That's my strategy, and I'm sticking to it.  Edit: For those of you reaching out, worried about me being attacked here, don't worry. I'm 41 years and a grown ass adult. Words won't hurt me :)";"260";"2023-07-30T16:49:10"
"First-time Poster (go easy)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15cx8ny/firsttime_poster_go_easy/";"TLDR: Swapping from Edward Jones to Schwab and looking for traditional IRA and other recommendations. \*Apologies for the following novel!     Hey folks, I am looking for some strategic advice. I started investing three years ago when I finished active-duty military service. My wife and I stupidly didn’t save or invest any money during my 20 years of service, so no IRAs or TSP starting off. We collectively were living paycheck-to-paycheck during my military service based on terrible spending habits.     In 2021 we sold a house which netted us around $150k. We bought another (at 2.499 interest) but put very little down because we used our VA loan and I wanted to feel the security of having cash on hand. We have kept the rest of the proceeds in the breakdown below. Not really knowing what I was doing, I opened accounts with Edward Jones and started throwing money at it. We were able to open the Roth's based on my income then, but have since become ineligible to add to those due to high income. Also, we bought all of the individual stocks and watched them plummet in 2022, but they have since recovered and we are basically back where we started.     Fast-forward to now, we still spend what I consider a ridiculous amount of money every month, but we are working to correct it and double-down on investing for retirement. I started working with a great company that does a 5% match with John Hancock, and I am maxing that contribution every year (about $20k) with 75% into RFHTX and 25% into the 500 Index Fund. I am not looking to change that allocation unless folks have a compelling recommendation. Additionally, we have roughly $5k/month that is unused (saved) and put in our normal bank savings account which is really giving us no return, about 60 dollars a month, so not really sure what to do there… I should note that I plan to work for at least the next 15-20 years and expect my current income level to remain static or increase.     So my questions are:    \-	As we are moving into Schwab, what index funds or ETFs would make the most sense for the Roth IRAs?   \-	Should we be maxing out Traditional IRAs with the intent to do a backdoor conversion later?    \-	What should be done with the cash that we have in our bank’s low-interest savings account?   \-	Are we on track or do I need to make some drastic move like taking savings and paying off vehicles / dropping the savings into my mortgage to reduce it / other?      One thought I have is to make the transition to Schwab and put the Roth’s/529s into whatever the advisor recommends. Then liquidating the $50,000 in individual stocks from EJ, put that money into a MMF with Schwab and use that money to fund Traditional IRAs for my wife and I. Would this be a smart move?      Below are some of our financial stats:   Age: 44 – seeking to retire between 60-65 y.o.   Current take home (net) income: $20,000/mo   \-	$12,000 from employment   \-	$8,000 from military retirement & VA disability   Monthly bills: $10,000/month   Discretionary spending: $5,000/mo   Current 401k: $88,000   (Edward Jones) Existing Roth IRAs: $20,000   USAA Savings account: $90,000   (Edward Jones) Kid’s 529s: $8,000 (although both kids have GI Bill, so won’t likely “need” the 529s)   (Edward Jones) Individual stock positions: $50,000   \-	Alphabet (100 shares)   \-	Amazon (60)   \-	Apple (50)   \-	Blackrock (5)   \-	Duke Energy (10)   \-	Meta (20)   \-	Microsoft (10)   \-	Southwest (100)   \-	Disney (20)   ";"3";"2023-07-29T19:02:26"
"Investing in software companies (tin foil chat)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18v3s5e/investing_in_software_companies_tin_foil_chat/";"Wanted to share some thought on how to pick stocks in technology. I want to focus on the quality of revenue. I did t know this until I spoke with a few experts and got me thinking about fraud and if there is a method to spot fraud in technology consistently.   I was brought up in the UK in the 90s and 00s where some managers made a fortune by investing in internet companies. Most of those people were long only investors and the horizon was super long. Their main thesis was around changes in society, habitual changes, that would have led to some internet companies to show abnormal growth in stock price. Amazon, Google, FB, Microsoft etc. These managers literally became millionaires.   The legacy of these managers dies hard and there are many money managers betting on healthcare tech (bio tech), food industries or energy transition. Their bets are almost always driven by top down analysis, instead of understanding the operations of each company. Most of these firms generate their money from licensing.   Licensing revenue has distinct characteristics such as - multi year firm wide contract  - cost of switching tends to be expensive  - once signed, your revenue is basically guaranteed for a good few years   One often overlooked is the fact that companies have a great leeway on when to book/show sales and cancellations in their book if and when these multi year licensing contracts get cancelled.  Imagine a hypothetical scenario where a firm sells a licensing agreement. The customer gives a notice or intent to cancel this licensing agreement at the end of the term or even in the middle of it for whatever reasons.   - there is often penalty involved in early termination  - the notice period is longer often in months  How does this cancellation appear in your quarterly or semi annual reports?  For this potential loss to appear in the official report, you would need this cancellation to be passed to a relevant department and recorded.   How does a customer give a notice to the firm of the intention to cancel the licensing agreement? Through their sales or relationship contact.   Once the sales team receives this cancellation, is there a process that gets initiated or can the sales team decide when to pass this cancellation notice to their management?   This cancellation doesn’t look good on the sales team that covers that region or customer type. Particularly if the contract amount was large, the bonus would be impacted. The sales team often starts a campaign to minimize the impact of the cancellation or at least understand why the contract is being terminated. These campaigns, due to the nature of the contract, could run months, right up to the date of the actual cancellation. And from what I hear, not very effective use of the sales teams time.   At what point, is the sales team forced to record this cancellation in their book? I think they will delay recording this loss of revenue till the very last day or they try to smooth the loss by booking this loss when there is a significant gain in revenue (new contract for example).   Does the same happen to new customer acquisitions? It could. Maybe preferable to record a new sale in certain months, due to accounting or reporting reasons, or bonus reasons.   For these reasons, technology firms revenue sometimes appears incredibly smooth, smooth because they are cooked, not by management of the firm that might have no knowledge of the book cooking of this nature, but rather on the ground by those who carry out day to day jobs.   This makes me want to spot firms without proper governance to short them. Firms seemingly doing well are the targets. Firms that rely on a few products are the targets instead of large diversified firms.   Eventually I think regulators will step in, but at the moment, they don’t seem to have much clue around technology licensing businesses.   Maybe this is a tin foil discussion";"0";"2023-12-31T09:59:01"
"Revenue Weighted indexes vs Market Cap Weighted indexes";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b45fcw/revenue_weighted_indexes_vs_market_cap_weighted/";"**Disclosure:** I am ass at investing, just a math and science guy who only started seriously about a year ago or so, so please feel free to call me out on any misconceptions or BS you see here. I don't have any money on SPY or RWL. I'm a boring old VTI + VXUS + Treasuries + My Employer and chill kinda guy right now.  I feel like I've been watching a lot of people complaining about S&P500 or just passive index investing causing things to inflate. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6nHqwkZOZg) (it's a dry video, which is good) talks about some of these concerns raised, and specifically the concern about companies being too invested into the ""Magnificent 7"".   I wanted to think about this a little more fundamentally and perhaps ""philosophically"".  **What does being Market Cap Weighted Mean?: SPY**  [SPY Composition](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/spy/holdings/)  The thing that stood out to me is that Market cap weighted indexes are distributed based on market perception, right? Market cap of companies is often based on future returns, not the current state of the business. This means, SPY or S&P500 is currently weighted based on the expected return in the future, which means it's a heavy bet into the future. What does that mean today? Based on how heavily the magnificent 7 are invested into AI for future gains, it seems like a pretty heavy bet on AI.   So while the future gains based on the bet that AI is going to generate these companies more revenue is driving the SPY high, what happens if this gamble is wrong? What happens if AI doesn't increase profits significantly, not to the amount the market is hyping up?  **Revenue Weighted ETFs - Bet on Current Profits: RWL**  [RWL Composition](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/rwl/holdings/)  So what does the S&P500 look like if you're focused current profitability and want to bet on companies that are profitable right now are going to continue to be profitable? Turns out it's pretty different. Walmart is all the way at the top, and Microsoft isn't there until number 13. If anything, this is an interesting insight on current profitability vs expected future profitability.  The biggest risk here is that a company that is profitable today isn't necessarily profitable in the future. In some ways it feels safer because if the bets on current trends (like AI) are wrong, you have your money in companies that are profitable TODAY... but there is a problem:   * Revenue is a direct fundamental result of prior years of work, but for certain companies that Revenue isn't consistent.  * A video game publisher may have a massive year, followed by shitty years, and any company with inconsistent returns like this will bounce around in it's placement of a revenue weighted ETF. * Normally, a Market Cap allocation compensates for this because usually companies with inconsistent returns like this tend to have lower P/E Ratio due to active traders being aware of these differences. * Revenue Weighted ETFs have the risk of propping up low profit margin companies, as long as they move volume.  **Fundamental Bet on the Companies vs the Market**  So the main difference to me feels like a bet on the Companies vs the Market. I don't fully understand the picture, but based on this discussion so far it seems like one thing that Revenue-weighted ETFs miss out on is essentially riding the waves of what active investors may know. As mentioned in the example where a company with inconsistent revenues year to year may hop around in your RWL allocation, I would expect that company remain pretty stable in the SPY because the market already knows this company and has priced it accordingly to its volatility... not something a Revenue Weighted market can do.   Maybe you can eliminate some of this volatility by having a revenue weighted ETF based on last 5 - 10 years of revenue, but now you're in the land of living in the past and fundamentally betting on the past instead of riding the active market into the future.  In the end, comparing [RWL to SPY in Portfolio Visualizer](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=1d2OXEPc4bHovETI9DltV5) is very interesting.   * Between 2008 and around 2020, RWL was actually generally head. * The COVID pandemic hits, shakes up the markets and status quo and until about 2022 SPY jumps ahead with internet businesses with less reliance move ahead. (Makes sense if you think about people going to Walmart not going to Walmart anymore because of COVID, betting on prior revenue being wrong with future revenue, ETC). * For a bit between 2022 and 2023 RWL recovered ahead... * And now we're back in the future, where AI hype jumps the SPY way ahead.  For some reason I was expecting to see less volatility in the RWL, but to my surprise this isn't the case, it seems based on looking at the charts. It says that a portfolio with 100% RWL has a -7% worst year, while SPY has -18% worst year, but I'm not sure how based on the charts seen here.  Anyway, thanks for listening to my mental dump. Curious to hear a more eloquent analysis from people here!";"4";"2024-03-01T22:01:29"

"What allocation approach is implied by Toby Nangle's new FT article on narrow markets driving equity returns?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15lgfgb/what_allocation_approach_is_implied_by_toby/";"What I take from the article below is not to rely too much on a macro-driven asset allocation strategy.  But what asset allocation strategy makes sense in this environment then?    &#x200B:  &#x200B:   www.ft.com /content/c5d7ee71-92a2-4840-9344-2f62e9642e61  # Narrow markets should humble macro forecasters  5-6 minutes   2023-08-08   Toby Nangle    The writer is a former global head of asset allocation at a fund manager   This year has been marked by strong equity markets, and what looks to be an astonishingly narrow rally. Of the 16.9 per cent returned by the S&P 500 index in the first half of this year, 12.9 per cent derived from the performance of only 10 companies.   With such a high proportion of a market’s value created by so few groups, it feels fair to question the tool kits of asset allocators and, more broadly, the product line-up of fund management firms.   Narrow stock market returns are, after all, the norm. Research by Arizona State University professor Hendrik Bessembinder shows that more than half of the $55.1tn in net wealth generated by the US equity market between 1926 and 2022 came from the performance of fewer than 0.3 per cent of the market’s stocks, with the other half of this net wealth coming from the next best 3.1 per cent of stocks.   Moreover, almost three-fifths of stocks actually destroyed wealth over the period. In quant-speak, the distribution of compound stock returns has been very positively skewed.   In addition, the skewness of equity returns turns out not to be a particularly North American phenomenon. Indeed, in the three decades ending in December 2020 the proportion of net wealth contributed by the best 1 per cent of emerging market stocks was more than 80 per cent.   Looking at the entire global stock universe outside the US, the proportion rises still further to more than 90 per cent. Winners have won big. Most individual stocks over the past 30 years have failed to outperform dollars stored under the mattress, let alone a local currency interest-bearing cash deposits — even after taking into account dividends.   Bessembinder’s work has typically been surveyed in terms of what it means for active stockpickers — with some seeing it as a rationalisation for chasing moonshots and others for pursuing passive index-investing. Less examined has been what it means for asset allocators.   Developed market stock index returns have been dominated by global companies — even if they each carry a domestic tilt. As such, connecting local macroeconomic developments to the performance of a region’s equity index can be something of a dark art.   Single large stocks with an economic fate that has little to do with their listing jurisdiction have dominated national index returns. For example, the photolithography machine-maker ASML accounts for more than a fifth of the total net wealth created by Dutch stocks in the 30 years up to 2020. Global fast-fashion retailer Inditex accounts for more than a sixth of Spanish stock returns. Global luxury brands LVMH and L’Oréal collectively account for almost a quarter of the returns from French stocks. These are not outliers. One cannot explain long-term returns without reference to such companies in pretty much any region.   If it becomes hard to explain equity index returns without reference to specific superstar groups, it stands to reason that it must be even harder to forecast equity index returns without taking a view on some individual companies. It’s easy today to focus on whether the Magnificent Seven that have powered the S&P 500 rally — Apple, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta — might stumble. With more than a quarter of the US market’s valuation riding on them, the question is not at all trivial. But 30 years ago, five of these seven had not even listed. It’s hard to take a view on companies that don’t yet exist.   I’ve been as guilty as the next asset allocator in explaining my preference for US over European stocks or vice versa with reference to some domestic macroeconomic outlook. Given that financials, utilities and property groups will carry a strong domestic flavour, this is still forgivable.   But when constructing a long-term strategic asset allocation, it is becoming increasingly untenable to justify regional preferences with reference to local macroeconomic forecasts. This may explain why long-term return forecasts for equity markets — or Capital Market Assumptions, as they are known — have such a lousy record.   The biggest single investment decision any institutional or individual investor is likely to make in their portfolio is their choice of strategic asset allocation. To create a strategic asset allocation one must make reasonable guesses about future market returns. Bessembinder’s research shows quite how invariably such reasonable guesses will be blindsided by the fate of single stocks.";"1";"2023-08-08T14:11:15"

"From Beaks to Bytes: Genetic Algorithms in Trading, Investing, and Finance";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/16qdj92/from_beaks_to_bytes_genetic_algorithms_in_trading/";"While the buzz on social media might lead you to believe that Artificial Intelligence is all about chatbots and automated text completion, the reality is far more complex and intriguing. Major tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI might have popularized language models, but AI’s capabilities stretch far beyond being a glorified typing assistant. It encompasses a rich tapestry of fields, from reinforcement learning to specialized search algorithms.As someone rooted in the world of biology, I’m captivated by a lesser-known but incredibly powerful area of AI: genetic optimization. In layman’s terms, imagine a computer algorithm that evolves and adapts just like species in the natural world. Sounds intriguing, right? This article aims to break down this complex topic into bite-sized information, suitable for anyone — even if you’re neither a biologist nor a financial wizard. We’ll also enrich this explanation with concrete examples to help you see these algorithms in action.  # From Finch Beaks to Financial Peaks: Understanding Genetic Algorithms  Remember high school biology where you learned about Charles Darwin and his theory of natural selection? Darwin studied finches in the Galápagos Islands and noticed that they had different beak shapes, each finely tuned for their specific diets — some for cracking seeds, others for sipping nectar, and yet others for capturing insects. Over time, the finches with the most useful beak shapes survived and had baby finches, passing along their “winning” traits.  In the realm of computational science, particularly in the domain of optimizing algorithms, a similar evolutionary process takes place through a methodology known as genetic optimization. Imagine you are developing an algorithm to forecast stock market behavior. Various iterations of your algorithm demonstrate distinct strengths: some may excel in volatile environments, while others may be optimized for long-term trends. Genetic optimization acts as the computational equivalent of the Galápagos Islands: it identifies the top-performing strategies and combines their most effective features to create a new generation of even more robust algorithms.  # The Six Pillars of Genetic Optimization: A Biological Symphony in Code  Imagine you’re on the Galápagos Islands, watching a group of finches go about their lives. Some have beaks crafted for nectar sipping, while others have sturdy beaks perfect for cracking seeds. These distinct features aren’t random: they’re survival tactics, granting each bird access to a specific food source. Now, consider a finch family with both long and short-beaked parents. They have four chicks, and by a stroke of genetic fortune, one inherits a beak even longer than her long-beaked parent. This unique feature gives her exclusive access to deeper flowers, while her siblings with mid-length beaks struggle to specialize in either nectar or seeds. In this harsh survival game, her specialized feature gives her the upper hand. Yep, it’s survival of the fittest, Darwin-style.When we think of genetic optimization, we’re essentially talking about a six-step process, repeated over and over until we achieve our optimal solution. These steps are:  1. **Initialization**: Setting the Population and Fitness Metrics 2. **Selection**: Choosing the Fittest Candidates 3. **Crossover**: Mixing Traits (Recombination) 4. **Mutation**: Introducing Random Changes 5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the New Generation 6. **Replacement**: Swapping Out the Old for the New  In this exploration, we’ll delve into each of these pillars to understand how the age-old wisdom of biology serves as the muse for modern algorithmic optimization. Each of these steps, intricately modeled after natural processes, works in concert to refine and evolve our algorithms toward the pinnacle of performance.  **Initialization: The Genesis of Algorithmic Optimization**  In the natural world, every ecosystem begins with a diverse population — be it finches on an island, bacteria in a petri dish, or whales in the ocean. In the realm of computing, our “population” is what we aim to optimize, and it’s often encoded as a string of numbers.Consider the world of algorithmic trading: we kick-start the process with a variety of trading portfolio strategies. Some might be conservative, triggering stop losses at a mere -3% and aiming for gains at +3%. Others might be more adventurous, with stop losses set at -30% and profits at +30%. These different portfolios make up our initial population.  After we have an entire population, we’ll convert each of our portfolios into an array of numbers. This is especially important for later parts of the algorithm like selection and mutation.  [We create many variations of a portfolio, then convert them into an array or tree-like structure](https://i.imgur.com/vuWpTBB.png)  After we have our population of individuals, we need to decide what it means to be a “fit” individual. For algorithmic trading, one way we can do this is by running trading simulations or backtests. We can then use the performance of the backtest and optimize for certain metrics, like sharpe ratio, percent change, or drawdown.  [We can optimize for different metrics, including percent change, maximum drawdown, and sharpe ratio.](https://i.imgur.com/KsrA3yb.png)  **Selection and Crossover — How our strategies “breed”**  Just as nature selects the fittest organisms to carry on their genes, so does our algorithm pick the best portfolios for the next generation. Though selection can be random, more often, it leans towards those that are ‘fit,’ or in our case, portfolios that perform well based on our chosen metrics.For the sake of simplicity, we’ll say individuals in a population mate at random. In our portfolio example, that means taking a random pair from the population and combining their genetic information.  [Two common forms of Crossover are “Random Crossover” and N-Point Crossover. The important thing here is that an offspring that looks like both parents is generated](https://i.imgur.com/ETp6kvw.png)  We perform this crossover operation tens, hundreds, or thousands of times. One common heuristic is to generate a new population that’s the same size as the old population. With that, we’ve now doubled our population size. Incredible!  **Mutation — Introducing Variation in the Population**  Let’s return to our Galápagos finches. Mutations in their genetic code might lead to subtle changes in beak size or shape. Most of these changes may be inconsequential or even detrimental. But every so often, a mutation could result in a beak perfectly suited for a previously untapped food source, allowing a finch lineage to dominate a new ecological niche.In the algorithmic world, mutations serve a similar disruptive yet constructive purpose. They introduce randomness into the genetic optimization process, helping to avoid local minima and explore the vast landscape of possible solutions. Just like biological mutations, algorithmic mutations can sometimes produce undesirable outcomes. However, on occasion, they can bring forth truly ingenious solutions that would not have been achievable through conventional methods. For example, in an algorithm designed for trading, a mutation might alter the parameters used to calculate the optimal point to buy or sell a stock. While this change may initially appear random and potentially harmful, it could unlock a strategy that significantly outperforms its predecessors.In practice, a mutation is typically performed by altering one or more elements in the array that represents a portfolio or any other object of optimization. The extent and impact of this mutation can vary widely. A “soft” mutation might involve the adjustment of a single parameter, such as the percentage at which a stop-loss order is triggered. In contrast, a “hard” mutation could involve significant alterations to multiple elements in the array, akin to a large-scale genetic mutation in a biological context. It is worth noting that the absence of physical constraints in the computational domain allows for a greater range of possible mutations compared to biological systems.  [A mutation alters the offspring in some way that’s distinct from characteristics of their parents](https://i.imgur.com/s5zGI8S.png)  Both in nature and in algorithms, mutations serve as one of the critical mechanisms for driving evolutionary progress, pushing boundaries both in the organic and digital realms.  **Evaluation and Replacement**  In biological ecosystems like Darwin’s Galápagos Islands, the process of evaluation is a relentless one, executed by the natural environment. Those organisms ill-suited to their surroundings — such as finches with beak shapes that do not facilitate efficient foraging — find their survival and reproductive prospects severely compromised. Conversely, organisms exhibiting advantageous traits not only survive but also pass these traits to subsequent generations, contributing to the evolutionary success of their lineage.Drawing a parallel to algorithmic trading, the evaluation phase serves a comparable function. Here, each portfolio, optimized for particular market conditions, undergoes an exhaustive evaluation process. This involves running a series of backtests and simulations that quantify their performance based on specific metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, percent change, and maximum drawdown. These metrics function as the ‘fitness criteria,’ allowing us to identify which portfolios are most capable of meeting or exceeding predetermined trading objectives.  [We convert the child back to a portfolio and evaluate its performance](https://i.imgur.com/iXh8iN3.png)  Upon the completion of the crossover and mutation stages, the newly created ‘child’ portfolios are reintroduced into the existing population. Each member of this augmented population is then evaluated based on the aforementioned performance metrics. Subsequently, the entire population is sorted in descending order of their fitness scores. To maintain population size and focus the evolutionary pressure, the least fit individuals are culled, leaving a new generation of portfolios that is incrementally superior to its predecessor.  [Evaluate the performance of all portfolios in the population, then retain only the top-performing ones, thus ensuring that each new generation is more fit than the last.](https://i.imgur.com/abKpe8z.png)  # Conclusion: Bridging Biology and Algorithmic Trading through Genetic Optimization  Artificial Intelligence is undeniably a multifaceted discipline that transcends mere language models or data classifiers. It is an embodiment of our drive to replicate and even surpass the efficiencies and wisdom found in nature. Genetic optimization serves as a striking testament to this truth, translating the principles of biological evolution into computational practices that refine and optimize algorithmic systems.Leveraging genetic optimization in the world of algorithmic trading offers us a cutting-edge approach to navigating the complex, dynamic landscape of the financial markets. Like Darwin’s finches, our trading algorithms evolve, adapt, and improve over time, driven by the unyielding forces of simulated natural selection. This technology, much like nature itself, offers no guarantees, but it does provide a framework for sustainable development and, potentially, remarkable innovation.Through the six pillars — Initialization, Selection, Crossover, Mutation, Evaluation, and Replacement — we’ve looked at how the science of genetics can inform and enrich our algorithms. Each pillar not only simulates a specific aspect of the natural evolutionary process but also serves as a critical component in our quest for computational excellence.For those of us who bridge disparate fields like biology and finance, the application of genetic optimization to algorithmic trading is more than just a technical achievement. It’s an exciting symbiosis of natural wisdom and artificial intelligence, and a potent reminder that in the world of AI, the possibilities are as limitless as evolution itself.
