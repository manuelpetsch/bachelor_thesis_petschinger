"Google in Crisis";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b4d5mn/google_in_crisis/";"https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/inside-the-crisis-at-google   It’s not like artificial intelligence caught Sundar Pichai off guard. I remember sitting in the audience in January 2018 when the Google CEO said it was as profound as electricity and fire. His proclamation stunned the San Francisco audience that day, so bullish it still seems a bit absurd, and it underscores how bizarre it is that his AI strategy now appears unmoored.  The latest AI crisis at Google — where its Gemini image and text generation tool produced insane responses, including portraying Nazis as people of color — is now spiraling into the worst moment of Pichai’s tenure. Morale at Google is plummeting, with one employee telling me it’s the worst he’s ever seen. And more people are calling for Pichai’s ouster than ever before. Even the relatively restrained Ben Thompson of Stratechery demanded his removal on Monday.    Yet so much — too much — coverage of Google’s Gemini incident views it through the culture war lens. For many, Google either caved to wokeness or cowed to those who’d prefer not to address AI bias. These interpretations are wanting, and frankly incomplete explanations for why the crisis escalated to this point. The culture war narrative gives too much credit to Google for being a well organized, politics-driven machine. And the magnitude of the issue runs even deeper than Gemini’s skewed responses.   There’s now little doubt that Google steered its users’ Gemini prompts by adding words that pushed the outputs toward diverse responses — forgetting when not to ask for diversity, like with the Nazis — but the way those added words got there is the real story. Even employees on Google’s Trust and Safety team are puzzled by where exactly the words came from, a product of Google scrambling to set up a Gemini unit without clear ownership of critical capabilities. And a reflection of the lack of accountability within some parts of Google.  ""Organizationally at this place, it's impossible to navigate and understand who's in rooms and who owns things,” one member of Google’s Trust and Safety team told me. “Maybe that's by design so that nobody can ever get in trouble for failure.”  Organizational dysfunction is still common within Google, something it’s worked to fix through recent layoffs, and it showed up in the formation of its Gemini team. Moving fast while chasing OpenAI and Microsoft, Google gave its Product, Trust and Safety, and Responsible AI teams input into the training and release of Gemini. And their coordination clearly wasn’t good enough. In his letter to Google employees addressing the Gemini debacle this week, Pichai singled out “structural changes” as a remedy to prevent a repeat, acknowledging the failure.  Those structural changes may turn into a significant rework of how the organization operates. “The problem is big enough that replacing a single leader or merging just two teams probably won’t cut it,” the Google Trust and Safety employee said.  Already, Google is rushing to fix some of the deficiencies that contributed to the mess. On Friday, a ‘reset’ day Google, and through the weekend — when Google employees almost never work — the company’s Trust and Safety leadership called for volunteers to test Gemini’s outputs to prevent further blunders. “We need multiple volunteers on stand-by per time block so we can activate rapid adversarial testing on high priority topics,” one executive wrote in an internal email.   And as the crisis brewed internally, it escalated externally when Google shared the same type of opaque public statements and pledges about doing better that have worked for its core products. That underestimated how different the public’s relationship is with generative AI than other technology, and made matters worse.   Unlike search, which points you to the web, generative AI is the core experience, not a route elsewhere. Using a generative tool like Gemini is a tradeoff. You get the benefit of a seemingly-magical product. But you give up control. While you may get answers quickly, or a cool looking graphic, you lose touch with the source material. To use it means putting more trust in giant companies like Google, and to maintain that trust Google needs to be extremely transparent. Yet what do we really know about how its models operate? Continuing on as it if were business as usual, Google contributed to the magnitude of the crisis.  Now, some close to Google are starting to ask if it’s focused in the right places, coming back to Pichai’s strategic plan. Was it really necessary, for instance, for Google to build a $20 per month chatbot, when it could simply imbue its existing technology — including Gmail, Docs, and its Google Home smart speakers — with AI?  There are all worthwhile questions, and the open wondering about Pichai’s job is fair, but the current wave of Generative AI is still so early that Google has time to adjust. On Friday, for instance, Elon Musk sued OpenAI for betraying its founding agreement, a potential setback for the company’s main competitor.  Google, which just released a powerful Gemini 1.5 model, will have at least a few more shots until a true moment for panic sets in. But everyone within the company knows it can’t afford many more of the previous week’s incidents, from Pichai to the workers pulling shifts this weekend.  ";"709";"2024-03-02T03:30:14"

"Epic Games wins antitrust lawsuit against Google";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18g9t8e/epic_games_wins_antitrust_lawsuit_against_google/";" SAN FRANCISCO — Epic Games won an antitrust lawsuit against Google on Monday, in a landmark decision where a jury found Google broke competition laws in how it ran its app store.  The decision is a major blow to the tech giant and the concept that Big Tech companies should have complete control over how pricing and payments are done on their massive internet platforms. It could open up other challenges to how large tech companies govern their marketplaces, potentially forcing them to allow alternate payment processors. That could cut into revenue for Google and other companies like Apple and Amazon, which make money by charging fees on any transactions on their platforms.  In summer 2020, Epic had revolted against Apple and Google’s payment-sharing systems for app developers. Epic tweaked its popular Fortnite app so users could pay the company directly. First Apple, then Google, booted Fortnite from their app stores for violating terms. Epic sued both companies, arguing the rules violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/11/epic-google-trial-verdict/";"938";"2023-12-12T02:13:50"

The company made that announcement—and myriad others—at the start of its Google Cloud Next customer event, which will take place over the next three days in Las Vegas.  Google also made some announcements about its growing set of in-house designed semiconductors. In particular, the company unveiled Google Axion, a new Arm-based CPU for the datacenter. Google said Axion will deliver 50% better performance and 60% better energy efficiency than comparable current-generation x86-based cloud processors. Google said Axion will provide 30% better performance versus other current Arm-based instances in the cloud.  Shares of Google-parent Alphabet were up 2.2% in Tuesday morning trading.

"Is Google’s Waymo potential underrated?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b5v744/is_googles_waymo_potential_underrated/";"It seems to me that among the recent Gemini headlines (which I find personally quite overblown, as Meta’s very advanced AI displayed the same flaws, and Microsoft’s Copilot was shown to display some real nonsense as well), people have kind of lost track of the autonomous vehicle business.   Waymo is by far the most advanced technology of all autonomous vehicle companies in existence. I’m not sure if people are fully aware that Waymo already has a commercial driverless taxi service in operation. I haven’t tried it but watched videos and it seems to work amazingly well. People love to nitpick autonomous vehicles and say “oh x and y are not working perfectly well”, but let’s be real, human taxi drivers are far from perfect and the service seems to be working far, far better than the average taxi driver. This week, Waymo received approval to run their commercial service in Los Angeles.   While most carmakers dabble in their own autonomous driving technology, many of them also have collaborations with Waymo. I see real potential for Waymo to become the de facto provider for most carmakers - the way that for years, many parallel charging networks existed, and very suddenly the majority of carmakers signed on to Tesla’s solution as the dominos kept falling one after the other.   With all the news around ChatGPT, most investors seem to use “AI” interchangeably with “chatbot” or more generally “LLM” or “image generation”. But autonomous driving is in fact AI as well.  Google also owns Deepmind which has been at the absolute cutting edge for AI for many years now. I feel like most people overlook this because you can’t just go to Deepmind.com and have a conversation with their AI. But they are doing some incredibly advanced stuff in scientific fields. Monetizing all of that is going to be a different story but I feel that from a technology standpoint, Google is very much doing impressive things:  https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/29/1084061/deepmind-ai-tool-for-new-materials-discovery/amp/  https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-04043-w";"254";"2024-03-04T00:11:54"

"Google unveils custom Arm-based chips ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bzyx8m/google_unveils_custom_armbased_chips/";"Google is trying to make cloud computing more affordable with a custom-built Arm-based server chip. At its Cloud Next conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday, the company said the new processor will become available later in 2024.  With the new Arm-based chip, Google is playing catch-up with rivals such as Amazon and Microsoft, which have been employing a similar strategy for years. The tech giants compete fiercely in the growing market for cloud infrastructure, where organizations rent out resources in faraway data centers and pay based on usage.  Google parent Alphabet still derives three-quarters of revenue from advertising, but cloud is growing faster and now represents almost 11% of company revenue. The segment, which contains corporate productivity applications, is also profitable. Google held 7.5% of the cloud infrastructure market in 2022, while Amazon and Microsoft together controlled around 62%, according to Gartner estimates.  Market leader Amazon Web Services introduced its Graviton Arm chip in 2018. “Almost all their services are already ported and optimized on the Arm ecosystem,” Chirag Dekate, an analyst at technology industry researcher Gartner, told CNBC in an interview. Graviton has picked up business from Datadog, Elastic, Snowflake and Sprinklr, among others.  Alibaba announced Arm processors in 2021, and Microsoft did the same in November.  Arm isn’t completely new to Google, which started selling access to virtual machines, or VMs, that use Oracle-backed startup Ampere’s Arm-based chips earlier this year.  Porting applications to Arm machines has made sense for organizations seeking to reduce spending on cloud computing because of economic worries. When Arm Holdings filed to go public last year, it pointed to Amazon’s claim that Graviton could give up to 40% better price performance than comparable server instances, such as the common “x86” model used by AMD and Intel processors.  Google has used Arm-based server computers for internal purposes to run YouTube advertising, the BigTable and Spanner databases, and the BigQuery data analytics tool. The company will gradually move them over to the cloud-based Arm instances, which are named Axion, when they become available, a spokesperson said.  Datadog and Elastic plan to adopt Axion, along with OpenX and Snap, the spokesperson said.  Broader use of chips drawing on Arm’s architecture might lead to lower carbon emissions for certain workloads. Virtual slices of physical servers containing the Axion chips deliver 60% more energy efficiency than comparable VMs based on the x86 model, Google cloud chief Thomas Kurian wrote in a blog post. Arm chips, which are popular in smartphones, offer a shorter set of instructions than x86 chips, which are commonly found in PCs.  The chips can also speed up applications.  Axion offers 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based virtual machines in the cloud and 50% better performance than comparable VMs based on x86, Google said.  “I think it completes their portfolio,” Dekate said.

Apple is specifically looking to partner on cloud-based generative AI, with today’s report citing text and image generation as examples of what Gemini could be used for. At the same time, Apple is working on offering its own on-device AI models and capabilities with the upcoming iOS 18 release. The discussions are still underway, and it’s unclear how the AI agreement will be branded. This would be a significant expansion of the existing relationship — default search engine — between the two companies. Looking at the rest of the industry, Google announced a partnership with Samsung in February to have Gemini power summarization features in the Galaxy S24’s notes and voice recording apps, as well as keyboard. Samsung is also using Imagen 2 text-to-image diffusion for a generative editing feature in the photo gallery app. Those features all require server-side processing, but Samsung is also using an on-device version of Gemini.

"Google rebrands Bard AI to Gemini and launches a new app and subscription";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1alyebr/google_rebrands_bard_ai_to_gemini_and_launches_a/";"Google on Thursday announced a major rebrand of Bard, its artificial intelligence chatbot and assistant, including a fresh app and subscription options. Bard, a chief competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, is now called Gemini, the same name as the suite of AI models that power the chatbot.  Google also announced new ways for consumers to access the AI tool: As of Thursday, Android users can download a new dedicated Android app for Gemini, and iPhone users can use Gemini within the Google app on iOS.  Google’s rebrand and app offerings underline the company’s commitment to pursuing — and investing heavily in — AI assistants or agents, a term often used to describe tools ranging from chatbots to coding assistants and other productivity tools.  Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the firm’s commitment to AI during the company’s Jan. 30 earnings call. Pichai said he eventually wants to offer an AI agent that can complete more and more tasks on a user’s behalf, including within Google Search, although he said there is “a lot of execution ahead.” Likewise, chief executives at tech giants from Microsoft to Amazon underlined their commitment to building AI agents as productivity tools.  Google’s Gemini changes are a first step to “building a true AI assistant,” Sissie Hsiao, a vice president at Google and general manager for Google Assistant and Bard, told reporters on a call Wednesday.  Google on Thursday also announced a new AI subscription option, for power users who want access to Gemini Ultra 1.0, Google’s most powerful AI model. Access costs $19.99 per month through Google One, the company’s paid storage offering. For existing Google One subscribers, that price includes the storage plans they may already be paying for. There’s also a two-month free trial available.  Thursday’s rollouts are available to users in more than 150 countries and territories, but they’re restricted to the English language for now. Google plans to expand language offerings to include Japanese and Korean soon, as well as other languages.  The Bard rebrand also affects Duet AI, Google’s former name for the “packaged AI agents” within Google Workspace and Google Cloud, which are designed to boost productivity and complete simple tasks for client companies including Wayfair, GE, Spotify and Pfizer. The tools will now be known as Gemini for Workspace and Gemini for Google Cloud.  Google One subscribers who pay for the AI ​​subscription will also have access to Gemini’s assistant capabilities in Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides and Meet, executives told reporters Wednesday. Google hopes to incorporate more context into Gemini from users’ content in Gmail, Docs and Drive. For example, if you were responding to a long email thread, suggested responses would eventually take in context from both earlier messages in the thread and potentially relevant files in Google Drive.  As for the reason for the broad name change? Google’s Hsiao told reporters Wednesday that it’s about helping users understand that they’re interacting directly with the AI ​​models that underpin the chatbot.  “Bard [was] the way to talk to our cutting-edge models, and Gemini is our cutting-edge models,” Hsiao said.  Eventually, AI agents could potentially schedule a group hangout by scanning everyone’s calendar to make sure there are no conflicts, book travel and activities, buy presents for loved ones or perform a specific job function such as outbound sales. Currently, though, the tools, including Gemini, are largely limited to tasks such as summarizing, generating to-do lists or helping to write code.  “We will again use generative AI there, particularly with our most advanced models and Bard,” Pichai said on the Jan. 30 earnings call, speaking about Google Assistant and Search. That “allows us to act more like an agent over time, if I were to think about the future and maybe go beyond answers and follow-through for users even more.”  Source: www.cnbc.com/2024/02/08/google-gemini-ai-launches-in-new-app-subscription.html";"511";"2024-02-08T16:34:39"

"Anyone else think Google has a lot of growth left ?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15no0dd/anyone_else_think_google_has_a_lot_of_growth_left/";"Google has a 1.64 trillion market cap. It’s the 4th biggest in the world. A part of me seems to believe that once you’re on top, there’s nowhere to go but down. But I also feel like there are many ways Google could increase their revenues.       YouTube still has untapped potential. Google could make it so users can directly buy the products they see in videos without leaving YouTube, which would make the life of content creators a lot easier and could be a huge cash cow.       A lot of their apps (Docs, Sheets, Maps, etc.) are still free while competitors like Microsoft charge a lot for similar products.       Google Search still has 88% of the search engine market share and I believe the integration of generative AI (which should come soon) will increase their revenues.      Many of their other apps seem promising as well.      I think Google has a lot of upside, but I’m afraid my bias (I like the company) is clouding my judgment. Should I look to invest in a smaller cap company or does Google still have significant room to grow ?   &#x200B:";"310";"2023-08-10T22:50:28"
"Meta, Microsoft and Amazon team up on maps project to crack Apple-Google duopoly";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15abmox/meta_microsoft_and_amazon_team_up_on_maps_project/";"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/meta-microsoft-amazon-join-overture-maps-to-vie-with-apple-google.html  Google and Apple dominate the market for online maps, charging mobile app developers for access to their mapping services. The other mega-cap tech companies are joining together to help create another option. A group formed by Meta, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, along with TomTom, is releasing data that could enable companies to build their own maps, without having to rely on Google or Apple. The Overture Maps Foundation, which was established late last year, captured 59 million “points of interest,” such as restaurants, landmarks, streets and regional borders. The data has been cleaned and formatted so it can be used for free as the base layer for a new map application.  Meta and Microsoft collected and donated the data to Overture, according to Marc Prioleau, executive director of the OMF. Data on places is often difficult to collect and license, and building map data requires lots of time and staff to gather and clean it, he told CNBC in an interview. “We have some companies that, if they wanted to invest to build the map data, they could,” Prioleau said. Rather than spending that kind of money, he said, companies were asking, “Can we just get collaboration around the open base map?” Overture is aiming to establish a baseline for maps data so that companies can use it to build and operate their own maps.  For many companies, Google’s and Apple’s maps aren’t ideal, because they don’t provide access to the underlying data. Instead, those companies allow app makers to use their maps as a service and, in many cases, charge each time the underlying map is accessed. For example, app makers pay per thousand Google Maps lookups through an application programming interface (API). Apple allows access to Apple Maps for free for native app developers, but web app developers need to pay. “That works for a lot of people, but not for others,” Prioleau said. Overture is only offering the underlying map data, leaving it up to companies to build their own software on top of it.";"792";"2023-07-26T19:13:04"

Google pays Apple more than a third of its search advertising revenue from Safari under the terms of the two companies’ search default agreement, an Alphabet  witness said in open court Monday amid a protracted antitrust battle between Google and the Department of Justice.  The 36% figure, which was not previously known to the public, is one of the clearest indications of how lucrative Google’s search deal has been for both Apple and the search engine company. Both companies have fought to limit revealing the deals’ details, citing potentially anticompetitive effects.  The incidental disclosure from Alphabet’s expert witness Kevin Murphy, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, was not expected. Murphy’s testimony came as part of the company’s efforts to fight the Justice Department’s claims that the company illegally maintains dominance over search and advertising markets.  Williams & Connolly antitrust partner John Schmidtlein visibly cringed when Murphy revealed the number, Bloomberg News reported.  The search default agreement is a major focus of the proceedings. Judge Amit Mehta has described the Apple-Google deal as the “heart” of the case. It’s a number Wall Street pays attention to as well. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi has estimated in a note to clients that Apple would see $19 billion in 2023 revenue as a result of the search engine default deal with Google.  Neither Apple nor Google immediately responded to a request for comment.  Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai defended such deals when he testified in the proceedings. But Google’s competitors have described the arrangement as damaging to their business. Microsoft  CEO Satya Nadella, for example, pushed back in detail when he testified in October.  Nadella said that “every year” he had held the top job at Microsoft, he had “dialogues” with Apple over a default search engine deal for Microsoft’s Bing, even if that meant billions in short-term losses. Nothing had yet come of those talks, Nadella said.  Nadella said that the idea of an “open web” was a misnomer. “Everybody talks about the open web, but there really is the Google web,” he said on the stand.";"558";"2023-11-14T16:30:14"

"Google lays off staff from Flutter, Dart and Python teams weeks before its developer conference";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cgiwto/google_lays_off_staff_from_flutter_dart_and/";"Ahead of Google’s annual I/O developer conference in May, the tech giant has laid off staff across key teams like Flutter, Dart, Python and others, according to reports from affected employees shared on social media. Google confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch, but not the specific teams, roles or how many people were let go.  “As we’ve said, we’re responsibly investing in our company’s biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead,” said Google spokesperson Alex García-Kummert. “To best position us for these opportunities, throughout the second half of 2023 and into 2024, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers, and align their resources to their biggest product priorities. Through this, we’re simplifying our structures to give employees more opportunity to work on our most innovative and important advances and our biggest company priorities, while reducing bureaucracy and layers,” he added.  The company clarified that the layoffs were not company-wide but were reorgs that are part of the normal course of business. Affected employees will be able to apply for other open roles at Google, we’re told.  In one X post, a PM from Flutter and Dart said the layoffs had affected “a LOT of teams,” and that “lots of great projects lost people.”  “We’re sad, but still cranking hard on I/O and beyond,” wrote Google PM Kevin Moore in the Flutter development community on Reddit, where he added that Flutter and Dart weren’t affected any more or less than other teams. “We know ya’ll care SO MUCH about the project and the team and the awesome ecosystem we’ve built together. You’re nervous. I get it. We get it. You’re betting on Flutter and Dart. So am I. So is Google,” he said.  Google also told TechCrunch that Flutter will have new updates to share at I/O this year.  In a separate post on Reddit, another commenter noted the Python team affected by the layoffs were those who managed the internal Python runtimes and toolchains and worked with OSS Python. Included in this group were “multiple current and former core devs and steering council members,” they said.  Meanwhile, others shared on Y Combinator’s Hacker News, where a Python team member detailed their specific duties on the technical front and noted that, for years, much of the work was done with fewer than 10 people. Another Hacker News commenter said their early years on the Python team were spent paying down internal technical debt accumulated from not having a strong Python strategy.  “[D]espite the understaffing, we had managers who were extremely good about maintaining work/life balance and the ‘marathon, not sprint’ approach to work. As I said in another comment, it’s the best job I’ve ever had, and I’ll miss it deeply,” they wrote.  “Python was one of the very first languages used widely at Google. It was the last major backend language to get a language team,” the user, gpshead, also said.  Though Google didn’t detail headcount, some of the layoffs at Google may have been confirmed in a WARN notice filed on April 24. WARN, or the California Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, requires employers with more than 100 employees to provide 60-day notice in advance of layoffs. In the filing, Google said it was laying off a total of 50 employees across three locations in Sunnyvale.  On social media, commenters raised concerns with the Python layoffs in particular, given the role that Python tooling plays in AI. But others pointed out that Google didn’t eliminate its Python team: it replaced that team with another group based in Munich — at least according to Python Steering Council member Thomas Wouters in a post on Mastodon last Thursday.  “It’s a tough day when everyone you work with directly, including your manager, is laid off — excuse me, ‘had their roles reduced,’ and you’re asked to onboard their replacements, people told to take those very same roles just in a different country who are not any happier about it,” he said.  Google said it would support all affected employees, in line with local requirements, by providing them with time to search for different roles at Google or elsewhere, access to outplacement services and severance.

"McDonald’s Is Supersizing Operations, Adding Google AI";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18cxlfd/mcdonalds_is_supersizing_operations_adding_google/";" Fast food giant McDonald’s unveiled plans for its largest expansion ever, aiming to open 10,000 more locations in the next four years. It will get some help from a multiyear agreement with Google, which is rolling out its cloud data and generative artificial intelligence technology in McDonald’s restaurants globally.  McDonald’s said using Google technology will help it speed service and make better use of millions of data points collected across its global system. Restaurant employees will use a chatbot called “Ask Pickles” to boost productivity, Bloomberg reported.  The chain, which currently operates 40,000 locations, will introduce significant advancements to its restaurant and customer platforms, including self-service ordering kiosks and the mobile app. The companies said McDonald’s would be the largest food service retailer to use Google Distributed Cloud.  In fiscal 2024, McDonald’s expects nearly 2% of systemwide sales growth, net new restaurant growth of more than 4%, and operating margin in the mid-to-high 40% range. The company will increase capital spending to about $2.5 billion.  Its My McDonald’s rewards members generated more than $20 billion in sales over the past year, McDonald’s said at an investor event. The global fast-food giant also wants to scale up its delivery, drive-through, and mobile-order business, and improve its core menu items. What’s Next: McDonald’s is also introducing a new small-format restaurant called CosMc’s, which will be led by beverages and a small menu of food items and emphasize to-go purchases. The first location is Bolingbrook, Ill. It plans 10 locations by the end of 2024";"167";"2023-12-07T16:07:40"

"Google commits to invest $2 billion in OpenAI competitor Anthropic";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17i8ysv/google_commits_to_invest_2_billion_in_openai/";"Google agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic, the artificial intelligence startup founded by ex-OpenAI executives, CNBC has confirmed. The commitment involves a $500 million upfront cash infusion and an additional $1.5 billion to be invested over time, an Anthropic spokesperson told CNBC. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on the planned financing. A Google spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to request for comment.  Anthropic is the developer of Claude 2, a rival chatbot to OpenAI’s ChatGPT that’s used by companies including Slack, Notion and Quora. The company was founded in 2021 and, in addition to Google, has received funding from Salesforce and Zoom and was valued earlier this year at $4.1 billion. Claude 2 has the ability to summarize up to about 75,000 words, which could be the length of a book. Users can input large data sets and ask for summaries in the form of a memo, letter or story. ChatGPT, by contrast, can handle about 3,000 words.  Research by Arthur AI, a machine learning monitoring platform, found Claude 2 to be most reliable chatbot in terms of “self-awareness,” meaning accurately gauging what it does and doesn’t know, and answering only questions it had training data to support. Arthur AI tested chatbots from Meta, Cohere and OpenAI.  In April, Google invested $300 million in the company, taking a 10% stake. That same month, Anthropic was one of four companies invited to a meeting at the White House to discuss responsible AI development with Vice President Kamala Harris. Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and OpenAI were the others.  Anthropic quickly turned around and raised a $450 million round in May. At the time, it marked the largest funding round for an AI company since Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI in January, according to PitchBook data.Anthropic was founded by Dario Amodei, OpenAI’s former vice president of research, and his sister, Daniela Amodei, who was OpenAI’s vice president of safety and policy. Several other OpenAI research alumni were also on Anthropic’s founding team.  Amodei told CNBC in July that Anthropic invested at least two months in developing its newest chatbot, with a team of 30 to 35 people working directly on the AI model and a total of 150 people supporting it. She said the market is growing so rapidly that there’s plenty of room for multiple players to succeed.  “It’s a really unusual time from a business perspective because there’s just so much demand for large language models and really more demand than the industry can currently provide,” Amodei said at the time. “The landscape is just very wide, and there’s really quite a lot of room for many different users and types of users to make use of these systems.”  https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/27/google-commits-to-invest-2-billion-in-openai-competitor-anthropic.html";"297";"2023-10-28T10:01:16"

Will this cause a sell-off due to misrepresenting the Gemini AI capabilities?  &#x200B:";"213";"2023-12-09T07:05:41"
"Google (GOOG) DCF Analysis";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1area1r/google_goog_dcf_analysis/";"**NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**  # Introduction:  GOOG has a very simplistic goal in their business, yet this simple goal managed to carry GOOG's market cap to a trillion dollar. GOOG's main business model is centered around helping consumers sieve through large chunks of data to find what they need or want to find. Recently, with the announcement of Gemini, GOOG's GenAI, it led to a temporary spike in stock prices as investors believed that Gemini would be able to compete with ChatGPT. I believe that the advancement of GenAI is necessary for GOOG given how reliant they are on Search revenue.  # Revenue:  The success of GOOG’s advertising is hinged on 2 criteria, being able to attract and retain users and being able to monetize advertisers.  ***For attracting and retaining users,***  1. GOOG released Gemini their generative AI to help complement Search. This allows users to process information faster or seek answers more efficiently. 2. GOOG has entered into a deal with AAPL to make Google the default search engine on Safari. This deal is estimated to be worth about 18 billion per year. 3. There is a large switching cost for long-term users to switch over to a rival search engine. This is so because using the Google search engine means that there is a high chance users will be indoctrinated into the GOOG ecosystem (E.g. Gmail, Google Drive, etc.).  ***For monetizing advertisers,***  1. GOOG is one of the largest platforms that advertisers can advertise on. The type of information that users receive is dependent on GOOG, GOOG controls the information flow to consumers and hence is a powerful platform for advertisers to advertise on.  Apart from these factors, GOOG has begun targeting SMBs (Small and Midsize Businesses).  How GOOG sees SMBs (Small, Medium Businesses) advertising with them is that GOOG will provide Gen AI to generate images/captions for their ad campaign then SMBs use these advertising materials and advertise on Search.  When forecasting advertising revenue, opting for less granularity, and due to a lack of public data, I lumped both search and YouTube together. Taking the number of YouTube users as a proxy for the popularity of GOOG’s advertising tools.  So, I assumed that it would take 1 year for GOOG to finish and get Gemini up to speed. I assumed that it takes about 2 years for consumers to get used to Gemini and for advertisers to notice this shift. This quick adaptation is because ChatGPT took off very quickly within the year it was released.  When forecasting revenue/users, due to the macro constraints and pessimism advertisers are cautious about advertising so the revenue/users have been dropping for the past 2 years. I assume it takes 2 years for the macro outlook to improve and during the high growth period, revenue/users grow as well as more advertisers start spending more.  &#x200B:  When forecasting Google Subscriptions + Others, which entails YouTube premium, GOOG devices, and Google Play revenue. I assumed that the success of this category is based on YouTube Premium so I forecasted this revenue segment based on the number of subscribers to YouTube Premium. Number of Subscribers in 2022 ([SOURCE](https://www.billboard.com/business/streaming/youtube-music-premium-subscribers-how-many-1235594920/#:~:text=That's%20up%20from%20the%2080,at%20the%20end%20of%202021)). Comparing Youtube Music to its strongest competitor Spotify, Spotify has a large switching cost due to years worth of playlists built that would be lost by switching over. On top of that, having to learn the new UI of YouTube Music and the lack of certain features that Spotify users are used to.So, the main driver for this segment would be YouTube Premium, given the indispensable nature of YouTube due to the strong network effect and new frontiers such as YouTube Shorts that are driving people to YouTube, and the longer unskippable ads, all these factors are driving people to subscribe to YouTube Premium. However, I’m cautious about how much or how fast YouTube Premium will grow. Due to strong competitors such as TikTok and Spotify, I’d assume the historic large growth will taper downwards as the high historic growth was due to the low-hanging fruits being picked.  &#x200B:  When forecasting Revenue/Users, as GOOG wants to keep their prices low to attract users to YouTube Premium, historically the revenue/users have been declining. However, as recently as July 2023 GOOG started hiking prices. So, I’d assume that in my forecast from FY24 onwards, the Revenue/Users begin rising.  Historic price hikes have been at around 16%, I’d assume that GOOG no longer pursues such aggressive price rises and begins tapering down their price increases. Their perpetual Revenue/users growing in line with the perpetual inflation rate.  &#x200B:  When forecasting Google Cloud revenue, since there isn’t available relevant data to create a bottoms-up revenue model I forecasted it as Y/Y growth. Taking into account ([SOURCE](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cloud-computing-industry)). Given that GOOG mainly offers IAAS and SAAS for cloud computing, as businesses begin ramping up their digital efforts in line with the global push towards digitalization there is an increasing demand for IAAS and SAAS cloud computing, especially for IAAS which is stated to have the highest growth rate. I assumed that GOOG’s cloud revenue grew at a Y/Y CAGR of 19.3%.  # Cost:  When forecasting COGS, TAC accounted for about 40% of COGS as per 2023 10-K. I assumed that TAC would tend slightly upwards due to the competition for traffic increasing from competitors such as TikTok.  When forecasting R&D and marketing, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.  When forecasting G&A, management has stated that there is a potential usage of AI to reduce the need for labor. I’d assume that G&A tends downward slightly.  # WACC:  RFR (1M Avg) = 4.14%  Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/)) = 1.06  Stable market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%  COE = 9.02%  GOOG has a bond rating of AA ([SOURCE](https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Google-Inc-credit-rating-820429365?lang=es-ar&cy=arg#:~:text=Moody's%20assigns%20Aa2%20rating%20to%20Google's%20senior%20unsecured%20debt))  AA bond yield (1M Avg) = 4.80%  Marginal Tax rate = 21.00%  AT-COD = 3.79%  Stock price (5D Avg) = $147.05  Shares O/S = 12433M  Market Value of Equity = 1828272.65M  Weighted Average Debt = 10 Years  FY23 Interest Expense = 308M  Market Value of Debt = 12769.72M  %Debt = 0.007%  %Equity = 99.003%  WACC = 8.93%  #   Conclusion:  Ultimately, in my base case, I value GOOG at $143.16 per share. I believe that GOOG is a company with strong growth potential. However, given that GOOG is a household name and especially with the recent hype when they announced gemini it has led to a lot of enthusiasm and bullish outlook that caused their prices to temporarily spike upwards.

That was the essence of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s testimony in federal court on Monday as part of the government’s antitrust trial against Google. Nadella told the court that Google’s dominant market share in online search means that publishers and advertisers shape their content to Google’s requirements, making it harder for competitors like Microsoft’s Bing to gain a foothold.  “Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web,” Nadella said from the stand in Washington, D.C., District Court. Nadella was referring to the way publishers often cater their content and advertising to Google’s products, like by optimizing their pages for how Google ranks search results. Nadella was questioned by lawyers for the Department of Justice and a coalition of state attorneys general who are suing Google for allegedly violating antitrust laws by illegally maintaining a monopoly in the general search market. The government argues that Google locked up distribution channels for general search engines through exclusive deals with browser and phone makers to be the default choice on various devices. Perhaps the most famous of those deals is the multibillion-dollar agreement between Google and Apple to make Google search the default on Apple products like the iPhone.  The government has tried to make the case that Google’s dominance, aided by these exclusive deals, creates a flywheel effect, where greater exposure to users leads to more data to make Google’s search results better and attracts more advertisers to the product. That, in turn, generates more revenue that can be used to fund these massive distribution deals. Meanwhile, the government argues, it becomes even harder for rivals to breakthrough to consumers, and as a result, they miss out on the opportunity for greater benefits or innovations in search. Nadella affirmed that argument in his testimony Monday, describing the obstacles a general search competitor like Bing faces to gain more market share from Google.";"760";"2023-10-03T01:59:21"

Let me give you first an overview about Google revenue streams by percentage:  57% Google Search ads, 10.3% YouTube Ads, 10.2% Google network ads, 11.3% Subscriptions and devices, 10.8% Google Cloud, Rest Are other bets.   Of course Google search makes up a huge chunk of the revenue and even more of the profits. But I think what many people are missing in many of the discussions about Google is:  1. Google will not lose their 90% market share over night IF at all. It will be years until the majority of people will even notice that there are other options now. They know about ChatGPT and are still googling.  2. Regarding to Statcounter Google had 91.8% market share in January 2021. Now after ChatGPT and MS Copilot and whatever, Google stands at 90.9%. This is so little change, that we cannot even speak about a trend at the moment.   3. IF Google is going to lose substantial market share it won’t go to zero. People are often pretending like Google is going to be irrelevant and losing all business. Not going to happen, Bing and DuckDuckGo existing during Googles dominance proves this.   4. ⁠The minimum market share will always be the Android users. As Google will be defaulted with Android and Chrome devices. As long as the Apple Safari deal is legal and active the minimum base for Google is HUGE. I can’t see people changing the standard search engine pro actively, especially if it’s what they know - Google. That something like Bing even has market share at all, shows that people are likely to stay with the default. That is not an insult from my side this is an argument from Satya Nadella himself, made in court. At the moment, IF they change the default, they are more likely to switch from Bing to Google, than from Google to Bing. Additionally I think you can also add Google cloud business customer to this baseline.  5. That means advertiser will continue to pump money into Google search. Even if their market share goes down to 50-70%(very conservatively). They will very likely remain the number 1 search engine for a very long time. A few anecdotal tech bubble guys are not representative for changing the habits of billions of people. And with more people getting access to internet, the market as a whole will continue to grow.  6. ⁠Google does not only have the number 1 search engine, they also have number 2 with YouTube. YouTube is also getting a lot of advertising money and is still growing double digits.  7. Even if Google search money stops to grow or would decline, you have to look out for, if it would decline faster than the other segments will grow. If it’s flat or declining like 1-2% a year while Cloud and YouTube and Networks are growing double digits, Google will still generate Billions of cash flow a quarter. Similar to the current state of Apple with their IPhone sales.  8. Googles businesses are alle potential high margin businesses and are still growing double digits. Of course search is the number 1 but the other businesses would also be worth 100s of billions on their own.  9. I don’t see the threat of Google getting broken up by the authorities. You cannot made a bear case for both. Either they have monopoly that needs to be broken up, or they are threatened by AI companies. You cannot make a case for both at the same time imho. But even if they are getting punished or broken up, this will take YEARS in courts and after that they will be appeals by Google which will also take years. Until then there is a chance that Google businesses are more worth broken up in parts anyway. I see that very relaxed.  10. All of this doesn’t factor in any bets (like Waymo or their 8% SpaceX stake) that could take off or anything they are doing with Deepmind and AI which is a potential upside imho.  Google will be fine. Why I think YouTube, Networks, Cloud and other businesses are too businesses that will continue to grow would take another 100000 words and I think there are enough sources and analysis for that. So that’s it from my side, would love a positive vibes discussion.  Long story short: They could have some short term struggles due to sentiment and temporary revenue and profit lost. But they will be fine long term.";"87";"2024-05-14T00:49:38"

"Google rolls out its most powerful AI models as competition from OpenAI heats up ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1crymiq/google_rolls_out_its_most_powerful_ai_models_as/";"Google is using its annual developer conference to showcase what the company is calling its lightest and most efficient artificial intelligence models.  At Google I/O on Tuesday, the company announced Gemini 1.5 Flash, the newest addition to the Gemini model series.  “We heard from developers that they wanted something faster and even more cost effective,” said Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, in a press briefing.  The unveiling comes as tech companies increasingly refocus their product development and rollouts around generative AI, which is of particular importance to Google because the new tools give consumers more advanced and creative ways to access online information compared to traditional web search.  OpenAI on Monday launched a new AI model and desktop version of ChatGPT, along with a new user interface. The new model, GPT-4o, is twice as fast as GPT-4 Turbo and half the cost, the company said.  Google also announced an improved Gemini 1.5 Pro model, which has the ability to make sense of multiple large documents — 1,500-pages total — or summarize 100 emails, according to a vice president working on Gemini.  Gemini 1.5 Pro will soon be able to handle an hour of video content, or codebases with more than 30,000 lines, Hsiao said.  “You can quickly get answers and insights about dense documents, like figuring out the details of the pet policy in your rental agreement or comparing key arguments of multiple long research papers,” Hsiao said.  OpenAI’s latest upgrade, announced this week, brings with it improved quality and speed of ChatGPT for 50 different languages. It will also be available via OpenAI’s application programming interface (API), allowing developers to begin building applications using the new model immediately, executives said.  With 35 languages, Google says Gemini 1.5 Pro has a 2 million token window, which measures context and indicates how much information the model is able to process at once. The new model has improved local reasoning, planning and image understanding, company executives said.  “It offers the longest context window of any foundational model yet,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in the press briefing. At the event, he gave an example of a parent asking Gemini to summarize all recent emails from their child’s school.   Gemini 1.5 Pro will initially be available for testing in Workspace Labs. Gemini 1.5 Flash will be available for testing and in Vertex AI, which is Google’s machine learning platform that lets developers train and deploy AI applications.

As of recently, Google and Meta decide to begin giving out dividends to its shareholders. Is this seen as bullish?   We hold big tech firms due to huge earning growth potential and they tend to distribute their earnings into innovation and R&D, which will with no doubt boost their future earning if done right.   Now that Google and Meta begin to give out dividend, it seems appealing for mutual fund managers to add more into their portfolios, which will boost their stock prices further. But this will probably hurt their future earning potential in long term as they will have less allocated to R&D. What do y'all think?   This will also give pressure to Amazon to consider offering dividend to their shareholders. Tesla? I don't think so. ";"98";"2024-04-30T19:10:00"

He also raised concerns about the way market sentiment went negative on the company after OpenAI announced ChatGPT in Nov. 2022 only to turn positive when the tech titan debuted its own generative AI software in May.      “What do we imagine would happen then, in any of the next 2-4 quarters, if Google Search numbers were to come in 'soft'? We imagine investors may once again ring the alarm bells around AI-related risks to Google's Search moat,” Shmulik wrote.  The analysts also pointed to Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) as a potential headwind for the company’s search advertising business. SGE is Google’s experimental generative AI-powered search platform. Like Microsoft’s Bing, it uses generative AI to provide users with answers to specific queries. The problem, the analysts say, is that the generative AI responses occupy screen space that is currently used to serve ads on the normal Google Search page.  “We recognize that \[Google’s\] SGE roll-out is still in its very early stages (limited beta in the US only), with the integration of ads still being figured out,” Walmsley wrote in a research note. “But our initial testing of SGE shows material changes to \[search engine results page\] vs. the ‘old’ Google…which we see as demonstrative of the potential disruption to Google's well-oiled Search monetization machine.”      Google is also increasingly facing challenges from the likes of Meta and Amazon in the digital advertising space. TikTok is also quickly playing a larger role in the industry. Increased spending on generative AI technologies could also cut into Alphabet’s margins.      The company is also staring down a slew of regulatory challenges including calls by the European Union’s European Commission to break up Google’s massive advertising business, which the commission says violates antitrust laws.";"95";"2023-06-28T12:09:27"

The whole idea seems completely absurd. And from the article, apparently something similar happened in 2021 with Australia so Facebook just blocked the media for a week until they caved. Google and Facebook are threatening to just block links to Canada if searched.  This entire thing just seems backwards. Why should a host pay to advertise for another company. Pro regulators are claiming Google and Facebook control the media and are obtaining advertising revenue that would otherwise go to the media. Making them pay to post links would fix that by in a way returning lost revenue from the media advertising. If anything i think it would kill small media outlets that can't afford the pay to play scheme Google would become. US Senate judiciary committee approved a similar bill. If these laws become more widespread, it has greater implications for any business seeking to have any kind of online presence where the financial giants are the only ones you'd find.  Am i ""wrong"" on this or is this just utter lunacy from slowly failing business grasping at whatever they can.

The iPhone maker has attracted at least 36 specialists from its rival since it hired John Giannandrea to be its top AI executive in 2018.  Apple has also created a secretive European laboratory in Zurich. Professor Luc Van Gool from Swiss university ETH Zurich said Apple’s acquisitions of two local AI start-ups — virtual reality group FaceShift and image recognition company Fashwell — led Apple to build a research laboratory, known as its “Vision Lab”, in the city.  Industry insiders suggest Apple is focused on deploying generative AI on its mobile devices, a breakthrough that would allow AI chatbots and apps to run on the phone’s own hardware and software rather than be powered by cloud services in data centres.  Apple’s top AI team is now made up of former key figures from Google, including Giannandrea, who previously oversaw Google Brain, the search company’s AI lab which has since been merged DeepMind.  Samy Bengio, senior director of AI and ML research, was formerly one of Google’s top AI scientists. Ruoming Pang, who leads Apple’s “Foundation Models” team working on large language models, previously led Google’s AI speech recognition research.  The company also once hired Ian Goodfellow, another deep learning pioneer, but he returned to Google in 2022, protesting Apple’s return to work policy.

We read all the time about startups having been founded by former Google employees. Seems like so often you hear about startup so and so being founded by former Google employees, or same employees leaving to fund a startup. It gets you thinking. How can Alphabet display such lack of clarity in their vision, lack of speed, attention, and focus in their other bets (I.e. waymo)?   How can Alphabet lack a gifted visionary when clearly there are so many there?  Is most of this talent locked out of leadership positions? And I get it. Not every talented employee can be CEO, or run every important business. But shouldn’t they have a real path to lead and run those positions and the brightest of them win?   I look at what’s there, and hear the current CEO, and he seems like a very nice guy, honestly, he does. I just don’t hear someone with a clear vision for growth, or excitement about how he wants to shape the future and contribute to humanity.   I also look at their Google Cloud ceo, and I walk away unimpressed. The CFO? She may be nice, but I just don’t see execution in streamlining operations to reach the same efficiency of Apple let’s say. And Apple has to run a much more complex operation spanning hundreds of suppliers, perhaps thousands, yet they do it.   Now leadership is talking about finding outside investors for their other bets businesses, what is supposed to be the innovation lab, chasing moonshots. Why seek outside investors?

"Google(GOOG) DCF: AI";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13yxxzw/googlegoog_dcf_ai/";"# Introduction:  With all the hype around AI and NVDA, this could be a strong catalyst for launching GOOG into its intrinsic value. Most of the climb had already taken place over the weeks. But, given that currently AI is the flavor of the month I'd be a little worried about adding more positions into GOOG. As a disclaimer, I have positions on GOOG since last year that I've been closing out and cashing in on my gains. I've linked my DCF, Revenue model and Cost model all at the bottom.  &#x200B:  # REVENUE:     ***Cloud***   %Rev, Cloud is an area gaining massive traction due to how much convenience it adds, And the switching cost of cloud is massive, having to port over the entire database into competitors and retraining employees, so the loyalty of Cloud customers are strong.    So, I’d argue that Cloud starts becoming a big part of GOOG’s identity.      Y/Y, Cloud grows at CAGR of 19% according to ([SOURCE](https://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/news/cloud-computing-market-size-is-projected-to-surpass-usd-2972-6)). I believe GOOG to be capable of capturing most of that 19%. But, 19% may be overly optimistic as it requires for the next 8 years about 40+% Y/Y which seems unrealistic to me, given how cloud is already such a large part of GOOG. So I used a Y/Y CAGR of 13.32%      ***Advertising***   %Rev, Advertising is still going to be a big part of GOOG’s identity, however with cloud gaining traction Advertising's role may be diminished.       Y/Y, Advertising will see its Y/Y tapering off rather than taking off. I’d argue that the growth of AI related technology like ChatGPT may render GOOG’s search less effective given how ChatGPT seems to be an enhanced Google Search. Luckily, GOOG's has its own contender of ChatGPT, Bard. Bard is trained on Audio data whereas ChatGPT is trained on text data, so the effectiveness of these AI is dependent on how the user inputs data for the AI to process. Ultimately, which AI will take off is dependent on which modal of communication consumers prefer.    Recently, GOOG has announced its plans to launch Duet AI, AI to help augment the experience on both cloud and Search. It’s definitely a step forward in the right direction, Duet AI could be complementary to Google’s already dominant search as not every search will likely be using AI due to how long that would take.       ***Others***   %Rev, With so many components in Others, there may be less focus placed on this segment of the business so it’ll take a smaller pie of GOOG’s revenue.      Y/Y, I opted to use historical average as granularity seems to be inaccurate here.        # COST:  ***TAC***   Given the competitiveness of Competing technology against GOOG’s main Traffic generator, I’d argue that it could be significantly costlier to acquire traffic overtime. Recently I've been reading Homo Deus which made a fair point about Dataism. As our data interpreter (AI) gets more and more accurate, you'd be at a disadvantage to not use AI in your day to day life. So if we have this paradigm shift of trusting and relying on AI, TAC has a huge potential of decreasing. But, given how little regulation and promising technology on AI there has been so far this may be either too far out into the future or just impossible entirely.      ***COST OF REVENUES***   GOOG has lumped Content Review, Content Acquisition and Data Centre together in COST OF REVENUES.      1. Content Review: Needing Employees to manually sieve through content for compliance. As the service gets more popular, more content means needing more employees. (Variable Cost) BUT I'd argue that it could be a negligible one overtime as AI gains dominance and can track content in place of humans. (Fixed Cost)      2. Content Acquisition: GOOG has stated it uses a cost price model for determining the amount of content acquired. (Variable Cost)      3. Data Centre: Fixed infrastructure in place, but more of Data center used means GOOG needs higher bandwidth which means higher cost (Variable Cost)   Since these are variable costs, I’d argue the extent that GOOG can reduce these costs to improve margins are limited.      ***R&D***   R&D the cornerstone of GOOG’s business philosophy will always retain a fixed % of revenue. As evident from historic data where the spread of R&D with respect to Revenue was rather small.   So, R&D maintains a fixed % with respect to revenue. But eventually when GOOG matures, I’d argue that R&D tends downwards.      ***Sales & Marketing + G&A***   Sales & Marketing + G&A also followed the same historic patterns of R&D where they always occupied the same % with respect to revenue with a small spread.   So, Sales & Marketing + G&A occupies a fixed % with respect to revenue. But eventually when GOOG matures and develops a strong branding relies less on marketing so it tends downwards a little.      # COST OF CAPITAL:  WACC calculation a little too messy to input here so I'll link it    WACC: ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/D48GrJl))  # CONCLUSION:     GOOG is priced at $146.02, GOOG’s recent innovations have been made only in response to competitors. It’s more reactive rather than proactive which may be a bad thing given how strongly ChatGPT has since established its dominance over GOOG. For GOOG to improve its valuation it needs to peer deeper into the AI realm and look towards augmenting AI to compliment its advertising segment e.g. Using AI to help advertisers or to manage Ad Inventory.

The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.  The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to ""address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights.""  The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.  The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.   How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted? The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.  The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.  The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.  Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.  Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.  Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.  Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.  Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.  How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut? Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.  Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.  The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.  Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023 The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.  This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.  There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.  Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices? The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.  However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&P 500, which is why S&P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.  The S&P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.  Most of the ""magnificent 7"" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.  The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.  Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.";"105";"2023-07-10T22:25:37"

"Biggest threat for Google ... Apple. Opinion on the two frenemies";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14xl74j/biggest_threat_for_google_apple_opinion_on_the/";"Disclaimer, I have a postion in Google and do not hold Apple directly (but I do trough BerkshireB/S&P), so my opinion may be biased.  While I think the underlying business of Google is incredibly good, I have the feeling that it moat is getting smaller. I expect growth from its cloud services, YouTube, and maybe some of Google bets might play out (Pixel phones, robotaxies, chromebooks if they stop sucking...) , but we all know that the most profitable part of Google business is its search engine.  Know, while Microsoft might try to eat Googles pie and is probably its main competitor over most segments, especially Bing/Chatgpt vs Chrome/Bard, Outlook vs Gmail, M.Teams vs G.meet and so on, I think the biggest treat is actually Apple.  Right know Google is paying a big undisclosed amount (probably around 20 bln $ a year ) to be the default search engine on Apple devices, where a lot of Google searches (from the most valuable well off users) come from. The idea that Apple could raise the price of the deal by a lot or start promoting its own search engine is quite terrifing. It would be a risky move for them (losing 10s of blns a year for doing effectively nothing, and coming up with a search engine on their own that gives satisfactory results) but given Apples pivot toward services and its insane customer loyalty it might not be that crazy after all.  Android has a biggest market share, but these people have a lower capacity/willingness to spend, so it doesn't really matters that much. If I had to rate Google search traffic, I would say that the one coming from Android users is the safest (and probably the least profitable), the one coming from Windows PC is still relatively safe (despite bing being default and intagrated with Chatgpt), and the one coming from iOS is the one most at risk, and unfortunately for Google the most profitable.  This article summarizes some of my concerns quite well.  An article I just read put it quite well IMO   [https://macdailynews.com/2023/02/21/google-pays-apple-20-billion-annually-to-be-safaris-default-search-engine/#:\~:text=Google%2Dparent%20Alphabet%20pays%20Apple,writes%20for%20The%20Motley%20Fool](https://macdailynews.com/2023/02/21/google-pays-apple-20-billion-annually-to-be-safaris-default-search-engine/#:~:text=Google%2Dparent%20Alphabet%20pays%20Apple,writes%20for%20The%20Motley%20Fool).

"Nvidia passes Alphabet in market cap, now the third most valuable U.S. company";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ar26eu/nvidia_passes_alphabet_in_market_cap_now_the/";"Nvidia surpassed Google parent Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday. It’s the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmaker’s stock soaring.  Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Google’s $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.  The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.  Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.  Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques — such as transformer architecture — used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.  Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a “code red” situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.  Nvidia is now the third largest U.S. company, only behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 21. Analysts expect 118% annual growth in sales to $59.04 billion.

It implies that Google Cloud is just crossing above a $36 billion annual run rate. Margins improved - operating margin in Q4 came in at 9% compared to 3% in the previous quarter and (0.2%) in Q4 last year.   Google Cloud is continuing to close this growth rate gap with Azure, and may surpass Azure leveraging AI. Like AWS and Azure, Google Cloud is seeing strong momentum with AI products, which is helping it win and upsell deals. Management said that the “strong demand we are seeing for our vertically integrated AI portfolio is creating new opportunities for Google Cloud across every product area,”   CEO Sundar Pichai said that “greater than 70% of gen AI unicorns are using Google Cloud,” and customers including Anthropic and Mistral AI are building and serving LLMs on Google Cloud’s AI Hypercomputer, which combines Google’s “TPUs and GPUs, AI software and Multislice and Multi-host technology to provide performance and cost advantages for training and serving models.”   **Is Alphabet monetizing AI? Yes**   1. Google Cloud is charging $30/month via subscriptions with Duet AI and management noted that customers are “increasingly choosing Duet AI” to “boost productivity and improve their operations.” This is a competing product with GPT 4 - Duet AI will incorporate Google’s Gemini, its multi-modal family of LLMs developed to challenge OpenAI’s GPT-4. Google Cloud ""is intensely focused on bringing the benefits of Gemini” to its cloud customers, and the rollout of the top iteration,   2. Gemini Ultra, at a $20/month subscription could help Google gain share away from OpenAI and thus Azure while increasing revenue.   You Tube, which grew at 16% was also slightly better than expected at $9.2Bn   **Net Profit jumped 52% to $20.69 billion, or $1.64 per share, (This was in spite of $1.2Bn severance charges)**   Subscriptions are a $15Bn business now, led mostly by You Tube.   **Alphabet is an extremely profitable company, it has an operating profit margin of 27%! — that too after all the massive spending on other bets such as Waymo, CAPEX on Al, etc.**   Alphabet’s earnings should double in the next 4 years to about $10.50 - an 18% growth.   I believe it is definitely worth buying at a P/E of 21. The Price to Earnings Growth ratio (PEG)  is just 1.17   - that’s nothing for a market leader, $342Bn behemoth, with a search engine monopoly, and a very strong presence in AI and Cloud.";"733";"2024-02-10T22:37:29"
"Wall Street Journal - Google Violated Its Standards in Ad Deals, Research Finds";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14lifll/wall_street_journal_google_violated_its_standards/";"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-violated-its-standards-in-ad-deals-research-finds-3e24e041  **About 80% of Google’s video-ad placements on third-party sites violated promised standards, new research shows: Google disputes claims.**  Google violated its promised standards when placing video ads on other websites, according to new research that raises questions about the transparency of the tech giant’s online-ad business.  Google’s YouTube runs ads on its own site and app. But the company also brokers the placement of video ads on other sites across the web through a program called Google Video Partners. Google charges a premium, promising that the ads it places will run on high-quality sites, before the page’s main video content, with the audio on, and that brands will only pay for ads that aren’t skipped.   Google violates those standards about 80% of the time, according to research from Adalytics, a company that helps brands analyze where their ads appear online. The firm accused the company of placing ads in small, muted, automatically-played videos off to the side of a page’s main content, on sites that don’t meet Google’s standards for monetization, among other violations.  Adalytics compiled its data by observing campaigns from more than 1,100 brands that got billions of ad impressions between 2020 and 2023. The company shared its findings with The Wall Street Journal.  In a statement, Google said the report “makes many claims that are inaccurate and doesn’t reflect how we keep advertisers safe.” The company said it has strict policies for the program that serves video ads on third-party sites.   “As part of our brand safety efforts, we regularly remove ads from partner sites that violate our policies and we’ll take any appropriate actions once the full report is shared with us,” the company said.  Some ad buyers who have reviewed the research say they want their money back.  “This is an unacceptable breach of trust by YouTube,” said Joshua Lowcock, global chief media officer at ad agency UM Worldwide. “Google must fix this and fully refund clients for any fraud and impressions that failed to meet Google’s own policies.”  The Journal independently observed invalid ad placements such as those the research identified, but couldn’t confirm the extent of the phenomenon. Digital ad-buyers and engineers vouched for the research findings.  To complete its research, Adalytics worked with ad agencies to analyze their clients’ ad-buy placement reports. The company also analyzed data collected by companies that archive the web to find instances when ads ran on sites that didn’t meet the Google Video Partners requirements.   Campaign ads for Republican Sen. Mike Lee appeared in invalid placements, according to the research, and he was critical of Google.  Among the major brands whose Google video-ad placements weren’t in line with the promised standards were Johnson & Johnson, American Express, Samsung, Sephora, Macy’s, Disney+ and The Wall Street Journal, according to Adalytics. It also affected ads for government agencies, including Medicare, the U.S. Army, the Social Security Administration, and the New York City municipal government.   “CMS is concerned with reports of invalid ad placements by YouTube,” said a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.  YouTube accounts for 8.3% of U.S. digital-video ad spending, according to research company Insider Intelligence. Marketers feel obligated to advertise on YouTube because of its size, several ad buyers said.  Google sells ad placements on third-party sites as part of bundles that include ads on YouTube itself.  didn’t disclose how much revenue came from Google Video Partners. Brands and ad agencies often aren’t aware that their ads have run on third-party sites, said several ad buyers.   For every brand in Adalytics’ sample, more than half the budget they spent on the bundles went to non-YouTube properties, the research found.   A Google spokesman said the overwhelming majority of the video ads it sells are served on YouTube—not third-party sites. Advertisers can clearly see that their ads might run on third-party sites, and how much is spent there, and can easily opt out, he said.  Brands typically pay about $100 for every 1,000 completed views of the ads on third-party sites, according to several ad-buyers. They pay the premium rate to avoid ad placements that are intrusive, such as those that load in the margins of the user’s desired content. Such lower-quality ads often sell for about $5 per 1,000 instances of ads, the buyers said.  “I feel cheated,” said Giovanni Sollazzo, founder, chairman and chief executive of digital-ad agency AIDEM. “What I requested to buy was not what I got. This should entitle me to a refund for invalid traffic.”  Ad placements appeared on low-quality sites that trafficked in misinformation or “clickbait” content, as well as those that appeared to publish pirated content, contrary to the promises of the Google Video Partners program, the researchers found.  The research raises questions about how Google vets the sites in its network, said Adalytics founder Krzysztof Franaszek, who authored the research.  The research underscores the opaqueness of the digital-ad market, where money flows are difficult to track and it is hard for brands to know that they are getting what they paid for.   At least 23% of the $88 billion spent annually by marketers on automated digital ad buying on the open web is wasted, according to the Association of National Advertisers.  The Adalytics report “proves the lie in Google’s assertion that it has made digital advertising better for all involved,” said Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), after reviewing the research. “Advertisers and consumers will continue to suffer from Google’s rampant conflicts of interest and fraudulent conduct,” said Lee. His campaign ads also appeared in invalid placements, according to the research.  Marc Friedman, founder of digital-marketing consulting firm Mfried Consulting, said he planned to ask for compensation for ads that ran in the wrong places and format. “It’s just not being honest,” he said.";"11";"2023-06-28T21:19:59"

The talks never reached an advanced stage, according to the report.  The revelation comes as the U.S. Department of Justice seeks to prove to a federal judge that Google violated antitrust laws by abusing its dominance over the search market. Google’s deal with Apple to share ad revenue in exchange for default status in Safari, and whether that agreement made it impossible for challengers like Bing to compete, have been a key part of the ongoing antitrust trial in Washington. Microsoft’s alleged sale effort appears to bolster the government’s contention that Google locked up the market to the point where its top competitor was willing to throw in the towel. It also shows that Apple, the world’s most valuable company, preferred to stick with the Google deal than pick a costly battle in search.

It is merely a starting point for those that want a small enough list to go through, filtering out to only consistently growing companies, no stunted/stagnant growth. There is also a list for a further refine into 72 ""most consistent"", and 35 & 38 value stocks currently at a discount from the ""most consistent"" list, but read the disclaimer about this, an expensive stock could stay expensive and vice versa for ""cheap"".  # ***METHODOLOGY:  1. I have analyzed each company blind, meaning I cannot see any information about the underlying stock including but not limited to: ticker, sector, industry, price, etc. This is to help eliminate bias. 2. I am sparingly looking at price movement to discern good companies, I will speak more about this later. 3. I am using 1Y, 2Y, 3Y, 4Y, 5Y, 10Y, 15Y, 20Y, 25Y time periods and select periods within each timeframe. Aggregation Periods range from Quarterly to 10Y. 4. The financial metrics I am analyzing: Revenue, Net Earnings, Free Cash Flow, Operating Cash Flow, Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, FCF/Expenses, etc. as well as price/metric for each of these per timeframe.    1. Using each of the various time periods, I plot a logarithmic/exponential regression of each of these financial metrics. Along with the regression, a correlation coefficient (R\^2) is pulled to measure consistency. and consistency of that consistency over time. 5. Now, the analysis:    1. The first deal breaker is low revenue growth or negative (which is immediately thrown out). Everything within a company can be stellar but no growth in overall sales is simply unsustainable for true long term growth unless it changes in the future. I am defining low revenue growth as 5% or less, although 10%+ is preferred and ultimately for the most part are the only ones that made it through to the end.    2. The next filter is every other basic financial metric (EPS, FCF, OCF, BV, etc), is it growing? is the growth consistent (high correlation with the regression). With these the cutoff is minimum 10%+ / year average growth. If any of these don't meet the par, they are tossed.       1. Income, FCF, Revenue Growth 10%+       2. Current & Quick Ratio >1       3. A high FCF/Expenses ratio is very attractive, as it means they have a lot of leftover cash : total expenses. Let's say it's 30%, all else equal they can increase their expenses by 30% (if they spend all their leftover cash) and in turn (all else equal) increase everything by 30% roughly speaking.       4. And an overall high R\^2 to measure consistency & stability of each. 6. Growth Adjustments:    1. Price metrics, is their PE growing? Is their PEG growing? these don't dictate wether a stock stays or gets tossed directly, I am only using this to adjust the growth of the stock to fit PE appreciation/depreciation which \*could\* toss out an all around 10%+ growth stock because of consistently depreciating PE.    2. Dividend Yield, this just turns the above return into total return which can make a significant difference in the case of an average growing company but one that pays a substantial dividend. 7. Full IRR Calculation, for both growth & value:    1. This is how many years it would take to get a full IRR, rounded up to an upper bound (slower turnaround), given 3 things *this does not fully count stock price appreciation yet, just actual IRR, I will try to workout the equation for that too*:       1. Intrinsic Growth Rate (CAGR of intrinsic value of company)       2. PE (EPS as the current point in the regression of the EPS over each timeframe, to help smooth out outlier earnings in an otherwise stabling growing EPS)       3. PE Growth (Regression of PE over each timeframe, average growth rate then annualized)       4. I will be adding FCF % of Market Cap to account for buyback potential    2. The equation is as follows: ---  x=∫₀^(y)  (g + 1)\^y da  ---  x is PE, g is Intrinsic growth rate, y is ""Years to full IRR"". You can access the graph [HERE](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pz4kmefqzw) 8. FOR THE ""MOST CONSISTENT"" index, the methodology is the same as above with much stricter cutoffs: there can't be (if any) periods of stagnant growth over any time frame outlined above, and R\^2 must be fairly high (>0.9) for most financials in general. One great example is FICO (R\^2 of 0.93 for EPS Growth, Revenue Growth @ 0.98, FCF Growth @ 0.98). \~0.95 correlation to a return of 25% yearly growth with 0 volatility, over decades is so hard to accomplish. Even .75 is difficult for most companies to sustain.\*\*\*METHODOLOGY ABOVE\*\*\*  &#x200B:  \*This is not investment advice, I am not a CFA or anything like that to be giving any direct investment advice, this is just my personal list of stocks I believe have good strong consistent growth, however it’s possible for some of them to underperform expectations, just as any stock  Edit: The 248 list is still solid and on the side managed to bring it down to the 72 most consistent, the google sheet & image have been adjusted to also show this last refination(? if that's even a word). this 72 represents the most consistent and noticeable growth in fundamentals and financials over multiple time frames, out of the original 1,500, represents only 4.8% that met those requirements.

EDIT: PART 2: link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18x1w5i/part_2_of_i_went_through_the_biggest_1500_stocks/)  I'll get straight to the point: I went through the entire S&P 500, 400 & 600 (S&P 1500) one by one, looking at each individual company's financials and price accordingly. Refined the list from the base 1,500 to just 248 that had the most consistent growth on: income statements, balance sheets, cash flows, and share price ratios to each respectively. Any companies that showed a recession in growth or a decline in financials were immediately eliminated. The broad index does not discriminate between growing and declining companies, just on size so there's a solid amount of stocks that drawdown the performance of the underlying index, my effort is to ""refine"" the index to only contain consistently growing companies.  I don't have enough time or space to show the analysis of each, and recommend anyone taking this list to research any given company themselves because I am not that qualified to blindly suggest any stocks.  I will organize the list in a readable and easily navigable manner as much as one can for and index of 248 companies.  \*\*In an attempt to take out all biases when picking each stock out, I evaluated them blind (not looking at the ticker or any information that would tell me what the company is, some of the results from this from types of stocks \*not\* chosen and types of stocks that \*were\* chosen to be on the list were slightly surprising and sort of interesting.  &#x200B:  Anyways, here it is:  &#x200B:  # Separated by Sector, then Market Cap in Descending Order:  [~~248~~ 254 Stock List](https://imgur.com/a/k8yoHcj) image (mid resolution, not updated, better if using the google sheets & PDF links)  \*\*\*[Link to Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ScMIY7Aw23rKEjLMMxg43joPfl9zsuKGy-igCNgS-Uo/edit?usp=sharing)\*\*\* THIS IS THE MAIN ONE  \*[PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Yk8AcAUmK5jSBYlcNON87coeReYL8mO/view?usp=sharing) of 254 base list (from 1,500, 1/6 size down)  \*[PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SnBRV9M9ehUp7X0qYCiGRLjKHAA2d14l/view?usp=sharing) of 72 Most Consistent (from 254, from 1,500: 1/21 size down)  \*[PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZXBwhNK92U7yqH46hsMJy3TNIjLfsrRL/view?usp=sharing) of 38 Most Consistent Refined (from 72, from 1,500: 1/42 size down)  [Link to THINKORSWIM watchlist](http://tos.mx/fUy0Klg)  [TradingView watchlist](https://www.tradingview.com/watchlists/134344514/), curtesy of u/hello_laco  Desmos graphing function for calculating full IRR, using PE & EPSG, [HERE](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qcnlosqzzm)  \*EDIT 2: I have adjusted the google sheet for 2 things: 1, the most consistent stocks are underlined (in fundamentals, regardless of price because you can't use price the same way as measuring consistency of financials). 2.

"Apple Unveils Vision Pro AR/VR Headset, Its First Major New Product In Nearly A Decade";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/141nmds/apple_unveils_vision_pro_arvr_headset_its_first/";"On Monday, Apple unveiled its much-anticipated mixed reality headset, the Vision Pro, the tech giant’s first major new product category since 2015’s Apple Watch.  The new device, packed with cameras and sensors, looks like a futuristic pair of ski goggles, and can immerse a wearer in virtual reality but also blend in the real-world elements of augmented reality. CEO Tim Cook announced the new product at the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference held at its sparkling Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino, CA.  Apple’s virtual reality plans date back roughly a decade, and Cook has been teasing his ambitions publicly for the better part of that time. As far back as 2016, the company filed patents for lightweight eyeglasses and a bulkier device. But while Cook reportedly preferred the more compact option, according to reports by Bloomberg, the technical challenge forced Apple to change its strategy.  The device announcement comes years after other Silicon Valley juggernauts including Meta and Google parent Alphabet have tried to bring high-tech headsets into the mainstream. Facebook in 2014 bought the startup Oculus for $2 billion and has released two generations of its Meta Quest, geared mostly toward gamers. Microsoft in 2016 made a big bet on its Hololens headset, a 3D augmented reality device, but has failed to gain traction with consumers. Google made the buzziest splash more than a decade ago with its disastrous Google Glass, a sleek headset with a camera on board. The product drew immediate outrage, with early adopters dubbed “glassholes.”  Apple has rarely been first to new product categories, instead letting other companies take the lead while it developed products it hoped could dominate over rivals. Apple was beat to market in mp3 players, smartphones, tablets and smartwatches, but its iPods, iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches have all become category-defining devices.  Apple will have a bigger challenge ahead as it asks people to put its latest product directly on their faces for everyday use—an aim which has eluded all its well-capitalized predecessors. Today’s headsets often lead to people complaining about the devices overheating, being too heavy to wear for too long or leaving sweaty foreheads. Others have found the experience of being disconnected to the real world—immersed in full-on virtual reality for long periods of time—too isolating. Cook said in an interview with GQ earlier this year that Apple’s device could increase collaboration, though Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision to achieve a similar effect in the workplace has failed to take off.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2023/06/05/apple-unveils-reality-pro-arvr-headset-its-first-major-new-product-in-nearly-a-decade/?sh=15606f2d37e8";"1150";"2023-06-05T20:29:40"

And I am trying to become more and more aware of this during my day to day life. Often times if you use a product and love it, it is a pretty solid investment.   I have tried this approach the past few years and it has been successful. I bought Etsy shares when I first started to use Etsy. I bought Celsius shares when I first started drinking Celsius. Also, got some planet fitness stock when I first started going there on a regular basis.   I have been keeping an eye out for the next product that I use everyday, but would love to hear about other peoples. What product have you recently started using everday that you love?  It can be a device, a subscription, a restaurant, clothing. You name it.    Would love to know what everyone has to say!

"Top picks for 2024? Let’s go!!";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18pjed1/top_picks_for_2024_lets_go/";"Hey guys with the new year around I was thinking what you guys are looking into buying and holding starting Jan 2024.   Here are two screening rules.  - must be listed in US (nasdaq or nyse) - must be an index stock with a market cap above 20B  Major factors for me are - interest rate cuts  - gen ai  - value vs market.   My top 5 picks for the new year: - Amazon. Overall a great company, but with the whole AI race and AWS providing it as a service, I think there will be some good tail winds for this stock in the new year.   Google: the latest AI show and tell from Google was mind blowing. They have a chatgpt killer. I think Google is back as the leader in ai based search.  Palo Alto Networks: cyber security is still going to be big in the next year and Palo Alto is comparative priced better when compared to Crowdstrike and others and they have products that align better for SMBs. So I feel they would have a good upside in comparison to competition.   Adobe:  I think this is another gen ai play. I feel with the whole digital media space has been really disrupted with gen ai. I would have loved to see the whole Figma purchase go through but nonetheless I think there is a lot going on here and I will see a lot of general users coming onboard adobe  now as the learning curve has just got flatter.   PayPal: this stock has done soo bad and fallen soo much that it’s just dead cheap in comparison to the sp500. With new leadership I feel things are going to see some improvement in the coming year. Fingers crossed.   Tell me what you guys are looking at and your reasons. :)";"284";"2023-12-24T01:41:30"
"EU launches probe into Meta, Apple and Alphabet under sweeping new tech law";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bnaa9e/eu_launches_probe_into_meta_apple_and_alphabet/";"The European Union on Monday opened an investigation into Apple, Alphabet and Meta, in its first probe under the sweeping new Digital Markets Act tech legislation.  “Today, the Commission has opened non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) into Alphabet’s rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing on Google Search, Apple’s rules on steering in the App Store and the choice screen for Safari and Meta’s ‘pay or consent model’,” the Commission said in a statement.  The first two probes focus on Alphabet and Apple and relate to so-called “anti-steering rules.” Under the DMA, tech firms are not allowed to block businesses from telling their users about cheaper options for their products or about subscriptions outside of an app store.  “The way that Apple and Alphabet’s implemented the DMA rules on anti-steering seems to be at odds with the letter of the law. Apple and Alphabet will still charge various recurring fees, and still limit steering,” EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said during a press conference on Monday.  Apple has already fallen foul of the EU’s rules on this. This month, the company was fined 1.8 billion euros ($1.95 billion) after the European Commission said it found that Apple had applied restrictions on app developers that prevented them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app.  The third probe focuses on Alphabet. The European Commission said it is looking into whether Alphabet’s display of Google search results “may lead to self-preferencing in relation to Google’s” other services such as Google Shopping over similar rival services.  The fourth probe focuses on Apple. The  Commission said it is investigating whether the company has complied with obligations under the DMA to ensure that users can easily uninstall app on iOS and can easily change default settings on iOS. The probe also focuses on whether Apple is actively prompting users with choices to allow them to change default services on iOS, such as for the web browser or search engine.  The Commission said that it is “concerned that Apple’s measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may be preventing users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem.”  The fifth and final investigation focuses on Meta and its so-called “pay and consent” model. Last year, Meta introduced an ad-free subscription model for Facebook and Instagram in Europe. The Commission is looking into whether offering the subscription model without ads or making users consent to terms and conditions for the free service, is in violation of the DMA.  “The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.”  Thierry Breton, the EU’s internal market commissioner, said during a press conference that there should be “free alternative options” offered by Meta for its services that are “less personalized.”  Gatekeepers is the term used to label large tech firms that are required to comply with the DMA in the EU.   “We will continue to use all available tools, should any gatekeeper try to circumvent or undermine the obligations of the DMA,” Vestager said.

"TikTok crackdown bill unanimously approved by US House panel";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b96sjx/tiktok_crackdown_bill_unanimously_approved_by_us/";"The U.S. House Energy and Commerce committee on Thursday unanimously approved legislation giving China's ByteDance six months to divest from short video app TikTok or face a U.S. ban.  The 50-0 vote represents the most significant momentum for a U.S. crackdown on TikTok, which has about 170 million U.S. users, which had stalled over the last year amid heavy lobbying by the company.  Lawmakers hope to move quickly on the measure and said the U.S. House of Representatives could take up the bill in the coming weeks.  ""This legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States,"" the company said after the vote. ""The government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression. This will damage millions of businesses, deny artists an audience, and destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country."" Before the vote, lawmakers got a closed-door classified briefing on national security concerns about TikTok's Chinese ownership.  ....  The bill would give ByteDance 165 days to divest TikTok: if it did not, app stores operated by Apple, Google, and others could not legally offer TikTok or provide web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications.

"Apple nears deal with OpenAI to power upcoming iPhone features with ChatGPT, says Bloomberg";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cp6s0v/apple_nears_deal_with_openai_to_power_upcoming/";"After talking with both OpenAI and Google about their AI models, Apple is nearing a deal to partner with OpenAI and leverage ChatGPT for upcoming iPhone features, reports Bloomberg. We can expect to see the workings of both companies as soon as next month, during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).  According to Mark Gurman, who spoke with ""people familiar with the matter,"" Apple first renewed talks with OpenAI to use the startup's tech to power new AI features coming to future iPhones, and is now nearing a formal partnership.   This comes shortly after Apple was reportedly in talks with Google to license Gemini for various iPhone services. ""Those discussions haven't led to an agreement, but are ongoing,"" says Gurman.  The news comes shortly after OpenAI announced it would be unveiling new ChatGPT features this upcoming Monday, a day before Google I/O. Talks between the Microsoft-backed AI company and Apple were apparently pretty far along, Bloomberg previously reported, as discussions of an agreement had occurred for some time.  While Apple has plenty of researchers working on the company's own AI models, those don't seem quite ready to be the star of the show, so the company has been looking for outside help.  The next big iPhone update, iOS 18, will most likely be announced during WWDC on June 10. With Apple nearing a deal with OpenAI, we may see some familiar ChatGPT capabilities integrated across popular iOS features like iMessage, FaceTime, and, of course, Siri.  It's worth pointing out that OpenAI's ChatGPT app came to the iPhone about two months before landing on Android. Apple hasn't officially announced any AI features for the iPhone, but if you look at the Pixel 8 Pro or the Galaxy S24, you can get an idea of what the new features might be: generative AI photo editing, transcription of voice memos, webpage summarization, text generation, custom wallpapers, and so on.  There aren't any details about what iPhone models the new AI might be available on, but if Apple follows its competitors, the features will likely debut on the newest flagship and slowly trickle down to other models.

That may not compare with the $39.18 billion expected by LSEG   Wall Street will also be looking at these key user numbers:  Daily active users (DAUs): 2.11 billion vs. 2.08 billion expected, according to StreetAccount  Monthly active users (MAUs): 3.07 billion vs. 3.06 billion expected, according to StreetAccount   Meta is projected to report revenue growth of 22% as the online advertising market continues to recover from a brutal 2022, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates forced brands to reel in spending.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributes advances in artificial intelligence to improvements in the ad business, which is growing faster than rival Google. In Alphabet’s earnings report on Tuesday, the company said Google ad revenue increased 11% from a year earlier, slower expansion than analysts were expecting.  Part of Meta’s financial recovery over the past year was driven by Chinese retailers, which have bolstered spending to reach users across the globe. Meta finance chief Susan Li most recently highlighted the significance of business from China in the company’s third-quarter earnings report in October. Li didn’t name specific companies, but fast-growing upstarts Temu and Shein, which originated in China, have been pouring money into ads on Facebook and Instagram.  While Meta has a very diverse base of advertisers, some analysts say the potential for Temu and Shein to pull back spending poses a risk because every point of growth matters for a company that saw revenue shrink for three straight quarters in 2022.  Zuckerberg, along with the top executives at TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Snap and Discord, faced tough questioning from lawmakers on Wednesday. They accused the Facebook founder of ignoring the severity of child exploitation on the company’s family of apps.  Parents attending the hearing lambasted Meta and other companies for what they allege are insufficient safety and design measures that have caused mental health issues for their children and, in some cases, even resulted in their deaths.  “I’m sorry for everything you’ve all gone through. It’s terrible,” Zuckerberg told the parents in an emotional scene on Capitol Hill. “No one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.”   Investors will also be looking for signs that Meta’s pivot to the metaverse is bearing fruit. The company has been burning billions of dollars a quarter to build out a virtual world that Zuckerberg has said is the future of computing. In total, the division has lost about $25 billion since the beginning of 2022, shortly after Zuckerberg renamed his company.  Analysts expect Reality Labs to show revenue of $762.8 million for the quarter and an operating loss of $4.26 billion, according to StreetAccount.

"Tesla execs Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel depart as company announces layoffs";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1c4wan2/tesla_execs_drew_baglino_and_rohan_patel_depart/";"Tesla executives Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel announced Monday they are leaving the electric vehicle maker and clean energy company. CEO Elon Musk thanked both departing execs on X, the social network he owns and runs as chief technology officer.  The news comes after Tesla said it is laying off more than 10% of its workforce.  Baglino had worked with Tesla since its early years, starting as a firmware and electrical engineer in 2006. He most recently reported directly to Musk as the company’s senior vice president for powertrain and energy engineering.  Patel joined Tesla in 2016 after working as a senior advisor to former President Barack Obama on climate and energy issues, among other policy matters.  Reuters recently reported that Tesla has set aside plans to make a more affordable new EV at Musk’s direction. The strategy shift includes a greater focus on developing a “robotaxi” and comes amid steep competition including from BYD and other Chinese automakers with more affordable electric cars.  Patel and Baglino had been deeply involved in battery and vehicle manufacturing, related policy, and turning Tesla into a multinational EV manufacturer. They were less involved in autonomous vehicle technology at Tesla.   Baglino wrote in a post on X:  “I made the difficult decision to move on from Tesla after 18 years yesterday. I am so thankful to have worked with and learned from the countless incredibly talented people at Tesla over the years. I loved tackling nearly every problem we solved as a team and feel gratified to have contributed to the mission of accelerating the transition to sustainable energy, a mission that I am quite passionate about.”  Musk responded on the platform, “Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Few have contributed as much as you.”  As of Monday morning, Tesla had not yet updated the “leadership” information on its corporate webpage to reflect Baglino’s departure.  Patel wrote in a post on the social network, “The past 8 years at Tesla have been filled with every emotion — but the feeling I have today is utmost gratitude,” adding, “My immigrant parents worked their asses off and as a result I’m the luckiest dude. Lucky to have been a part of @BarackObama’s campaign/administration, and truly honored to have worked at @Tesla to positively changing multiple industries.”  Musk replied to Patel, saying, “Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Much appreciated.”  The CEO also said, in a post on X on Monday, “About every 5 years, we need to reorganize and streamline the company for the next phase of growth.”  Baglino and Patel were not immediately available for comment.

"Help me understand how Tesla isn't **insanely** overpriced.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18tf7sf/help_me_understand_how_tesla_isnt_insanely/";"Hey everyone. I'm trying to wrap my head around why Tesla's stock is so insanely high with the outlook looking not so great. People keep buying it and I can't understand why, other than people are buying it for a long term AI holding. If thats the case, isn't there FAR better stocks to buy?  https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/price-earnings-peg-ratios  Even looking at 2025, the stock still looks very overpriced at a forward PE of 55.4. PEG ratio is 5.11, lol. I don't know that I've seen a PEG ratio that high before.  There's also some headwinds for Tesla. They recently lost the federal tax credit on most of their lineup. This will undoubtedly affect sales and their margins, but admittedly they should remain profitable without the tax credits. IIRC one of the articles I read said that, without the credits, their margin is around 30%, which is still higher than most auto manufacturers. But still, for this company being valued higher than any other auto manufacturer in the world, even ones that sell exponentially more vehicles, I still don't see how the stock price equals reality.   https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelharley/2023/10/30/5-reasons-why-electric-vehicle-sales-have-slowed/  There has been a slowdown already in electric vehicle sales that will most likely be accelerated by losing the tax credits. Granted that's not all Tesla's fault. We are still a few years away from viable Li-Ion alternatives being ready for mass adoption. Until that happens, the cost of the batteries and rare minerals to make them will remain the biggest hurdle they face. Not to mention hydrogen powered hybrids are slated for mass production starting next year. Electricity rates are constantly increasing. Even if you have a bunch of solar panels, you still paid for that electricity, even if it's cheaper than what you're getting from your utility company. Whereas water is the most abundant resource on the planet. The advantage here does not go for pure electric vehicles IMO.  As far as the AI angle, are they really a competitor when they still only have level 2 autonomous driving? Seems to me like Google would be an infinitely better stock for the AI angle since they are expanding to level 3 and 4 autonomous driving, no? Even if they don't plan on making vehicles, Google seems like the no brainer here and it has very realistic valuations. If im wrong here, please explain why. This post isn't to shit on Tesla stock.

Google was and is the king in Data, yet we have ChatGPT and Anthropics took them by surprised. They have fraction of data that google has, yet they are far better LLM model than Gemini. It clearly isn't about quantity of data, more so on quality and how  it is used to train your model.  Same thing for selfdriving, we literally have Waymo running since 2019, and now expanding to even more cities but people refuse to acknowledge. Tesla has no lead in AI, not in software or hardware. if you listened to TSLA's latest earning call, there was also no mention of dojo, and instead they kept bringing up about buying NVDA H100 to build super computer. This throws out any vertical integration argument as well.  I know people still like to drink Musk coolaid but this is not going to end well. And before you think I am one sour grape because the stock went up 12%, do check my comment history. I insisted in buying calls for yesterday's earning. But that doesn't change the fact, that tesla is going to be a dead money for a while. It IS a well run car company, with no debt and state of art manufacturing.

"Xiaomi releases electric car $4K cheaper than Tesla's Model 3 as price wars heat up";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bpy94c/xiaomi_releases_electric_car_4k_cheaper_than/";"Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi said Thursday it will sell its first car for far less than Tesla’s Model 3, as price wars heat up in China’s fiercely competitive electric car market.  Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said the standard version of the SU7 will sell for 215,900 yuan ($30,408) in the country — a price he acknowledged would mean the company was selling each car at a loss.  Tesla’s Model 3 starts at 245,900 yuan in China.  Lei claimed the standard version of the SU7 beat the Model 3 on more than 90% of its specifications, except on two aspects that he said it might take Xiaomi at least three to five years to catch up with Tesla on. He also said the SU7 had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus the Model 3′s 606 kilometers. The company said orders had exceeded 50,000 cars in the 27 minutes since sales started at 10 p.m. Beijing time Thursday.  Deliveries are set to start by the end of April, Lei said. Lei also claimed that Xiaomi’s car factory, for which all “key” steps are fully automated, can produce an SU7 every 76 seconds. It was not immediately clear whether the factory was fully operational.  Earlier this week, the Xiaomi CEO said on social media the SU7 would be the best sedan “under 500,000 yuan” ($69,328).  The car is entering a fiercely competitive market in China, where companies are launching a slew of new models and cutting prices in order to survive. Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has partnered with traditional automakers, most notably launching the Aito brand whose vehicles are often on display in Huawei smartphone showrooms.  Tesla’s Model 3 is the best-selling new energy sedan in China that has a driving range of at least 600 kilometers (372 miles) and costs less than 500,000 yuan, according to data from industry website Autohome.  BYD’s Han sedan starts at 169,800 yuan, according to Autohome.  Nio’s ET5 starts at 298,000 yuan, while Xpeng’s P7 starts at 209,900 yuan, the data showed. Geely-owned Zeekr’s 007 sedan starts at 209,900 yuan, according to Autohome.  Sales of new energy vehicles, which include battery-only powered cars, have surged in China to account for about one-third of new passenger cars sold, according to the China Passenger Car Association.  Accessories  The heads of competing electric car startups Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto were among the featured guests at the Xiaomi SU7 launch event.  Lei on Thursday showed off a range of accessories such as an in-car refrigerator, a custom front-window shade, and a smartphone holder, some available for free with a car purchase before the end of April, and others for a separate price.  The SU7 supports Apple’s Car Play and can integrate with the iPad, Lei said. He also revealed driver-assist tech for highways and cities, set to be fully available in China in August.  Tesla’s Autopilot for driver assist on highways is available in China, but the company’s “Full Self Driving” for city streets has yet to be released in the country.  Despite saying Xiaomi wanted to compete with Porsche at a car tech event in December, Lei acknowledged that the SU7 had longer to go before it might be able to compete at this more premium level. He announced that the “Max” version of the SU7, aimed as a competitor with Porsche’s Taycan, would sell for 299,900 yuan.  Ecosystem of devices  The SU7 is part of Xiaomi’s recently launched “Human x Car x Home” strategy that seeks to build an ecosystem of devices connected to its new HyperOS operating system. Most of the company’s revenue is from phones, with just under 30% coming from appliances and other consumer products.  Although Xiaomi is generally known for more affordable products, its President Lu Weibing told CNBC earlier this year the company has been pursuing a premiumization strategy since 2020 — and that there are about 20 million users in that price segment who might buy the SU7.  Lu told CNBC that the SU7 will first be sold to consumers in China, and that it would take at least two to three years for any overseas launch.  The company showed off the car at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in late February, following a reveal of the vehicle’s exterior and tech in Beijing in late December.

Analysts at UBS said that while they had flagged risks around HelloFresh’s guidance, its outlook, released after the market close on Thursday, was “far worse” than anticipated. Disappointing growth and adjusted earnings forecasts indicated elevated customer acquisition costs are “expected to persist in 2024,” they said in a note.  Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, called the outlook for 2024 “disappointing” and noted the removal of its previously announced targets for 2025, which the company attributed to a “very different operating environment.”  The Berlin-based firm on Thursday said it expected adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to come in at 448 million euros ($480 million) for fiscal 2023, down from 477 million euros the year before.   It also revealed it expects adjusted EBITDA in 2024 to fall to between 350 million and 400 million euros, despite a forecast for higher revenue from the North American market.

"The future picks and shovels of AI may not be GPUs but ASICs, following the crypto trajectory. GOOGL and the dreaded Samsung appear to be the leaders in this space. What is the highest-weighted Samsung ETF and what are other industry-leading AI FPGA/ASICs tickers?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13yhq75/the_future_picks_and_shovels_of_ai_may_not_be/";"For context and a disclaimer, I own NVDA (and AAPL and ASML) in this space, having ridden through the last crash and rebound without checking my portfolio and counting fake money, but I am overexposed and don't want to add to the overweighted positions now.   I think that NVDA will always be an important company at the forefront of AI research, there is a good chance that NVDA's trajectory could be similar to its performance after the fall of cr*pto for the same reasons. In NVDA's favor, you can read any AI paper, which will be benchmarked on NVDA GPUs, download the requisite libraries, and do it yourself. It is a royal pain to implement algorithms on any other GPU even if you found a programmer with a 5-page blog post about how to do it with lots of particular versions of out-dated libraries, so I own NVDA. CUDA rocks, but NVDA doesn't want to let it out. Metal for OSX is pretty good, but no one uses it and AAPL doesn't do serious system on a chip cluster/cloud computing yet, though they will have an announcement 2-3 years out given Tim Cook's slow feet. For example, we are going to see AAPL AR/VR this week, but he probably didn't shovel out AAPL's piles of cash until FB announced that it was now Meta and that Zuckerberg would be the lord of the metaverse with the most awesome meta-real-estate.  Back to the previous fall of NVDA, you could once pool mine shitcoins with GPUs, I've done it, but that became energetically unprofitable when people found a cheaper way to do it, first with FPGAs and then with ASICs, which require millions and millions more to make work once you know exactly what you need to make. The advantage is that fewer operations occur with parallelizable algorithms, and FPGAs use less energy than do-anything GPU/CPU computations, but they are an expensive pain to program. When you are absolutely done building a better mousetrap, ASICs use the least amount of energy and can perform operations much faster and price-out GPUs in terms of upfront costs (once printed) and recurring energy costs. There was a time when you couldn't but NVDA's best GPUs for gaming because people were using them to mine shitcoins (diclaimer: I own a less than 5% stake of ETH2, and negligible bitcoin, only as an alternative to shit-yield savings accounts, which would be better off in treasuries anyway). I digress. A point came where it was dumb to mine with GPUs because ASICs arrived, and proof-of-work algorithms made it dumb to mine in the first place, which was waste of carbon footprint in the first place. Then, NVDA GPU prices crashed along with NVDA stock, but NVDA was still the machine learning leader. At some point, this will happen to NVDA again. MSFT is already shoveling cash at AMD to build their next AI supercomputer to undercut NVDA prices, but AMD's price is too high right now for me, even when I love tech stocks as I don't plan to retire for decades, and I think AMD won't win with their GPUs in the very long term because of ASICs, even if they make a CUDA-clone language and open source it.    Years ago, a paper titled ""Attention is all you need"" rocked the AI world and spawned GPT, GPT2, up to GPT4. Given the fifth largest GPU-based supercomptuer, a search engine's worth of data that people gave away, you can build a great AI mousetrap that can do the job students and corporate middle managers and pencil pushers. In a decade or two, programming complex programs with human-levels of bugs and mistakes will be a reality. We have a good mousetrap. Googles TPU v4 supercomputers use optics-based AI ASICs produced and patented by Samsung. I used to be a fan of Samsung, but then new management took over and it has dived off a cliff. Their appliances have the performance of robots bathed in saltwater, and I swore of Samsung phones after using them since forever when they started pushing shit malware games and apps onto my phone with every urgent security update, and every new phone increasingly locked app developers out of the real hardware, so you could use the Samsung app for a camera, but nothing else. But, and please correct me if I am wrong, I think Samsung may be the current leader in AI ASICs. I thinking GOOGL is still behind and their new Samsung-based supercomputer is the wrong mousetrap, but GOOGL programmers have certainly already been tasked with building a GOOGL v5 supercomputer that is dedicated to the transformers that underpin GPT through GPT4. I don't own GOOGL, but I may buy it during market corrections.    Unfortunately, I don't have hundreds of K for an international account, and the Samsung OTC ticker doesn't correlate with Samsung's price in Korea and I don't trust it. I read about ETFs trying to reduce Samsung's weight, but I want an ETF that is dominated by it. Samsung still makes great sensors, invests heavily in research, and some departments within the fetid bureaucracy are still highly competent. So, please offer any ETF suggestions. I am fine with also investing in Korea's broader tech industry, despite the problems with Asian tech companies and their lagging China-based supply chains and the problems with China deciding that money is no longer free in its state-based kleptocracy economy.   Please send me any tickers that I can research that may not have caught the current AI wave and that might still be well positioned for large future returns assuming that AI ASICs become the future, which I feel is a given. This might include companies dedicated to programming FPGAs and ASICs.";"14";"2023-06-02T18:41:58"
"Amazon spends $2.75B on AI startup Anthropic, its largest venture investment";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bp6rv9/amazon_spends_275b_on_ai_startup_anthropic_its/";"Amazon is making its largest outside investment in its three-decade history as it looks to gain an edge in the artificial intelligence race.   The tech giant said it will spend another $2.75 billion backing Anthropic, a San Francisco-based startup that’s widely viewed as a frontrunner in generative artificial intelligence. Its foundation model and chatbot Claude competes with OpenAI and ChatGPT.  The companies announced an initial $1.25 billion investment in September, and said at the time that Amazon would invest up to $4 billion. Wednesday’s news marks Amazon’s second tranche of that funding.  Amazon will maintain a minority stake in the company and won’t have an Anthropic board seat, the company said. The deal was struck at the AI startup’s last valuation, which was $18.4 billion, according to a source.   Over the past year, Anthropic closed five different funding deals worth about $7.3 billion — and with the new Amazon investment, the total exceeds $10 billion. The company’s product directly competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT in both the enterprise and consumer worlds, and it was founded by ex-OpenAI research executives and employees.  News of the Amazon investment comes weeks after Anthropic debuted Claude 3, its newest suite of AI models that it says are its fastest and most powerful yet. The company said the most capable of its new models outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini Ultra on industry benchmark tests, such as undergraduate level knowledge, graduate level reasoning and basic mathematics.  “Generative AI is poised to be the most transformational technology of our time, and we believe our strategic collaboration with Anthropic will further improve our customers’ experiences, and look forward to what’s next,” said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of data and AI at AWS.  Amazon’s move is the latest in a spending blitz among cloud providers to stay ahead in the AI race. And it’s the second update in a week to Anthropic’s capital structure. Late Friday, bankruptcy filings showed crypto exchange FTX struck a deal with a group of buyers to sell the majority of its stake in Anthropic, confirming a CNBC report from last week.  The term generative AI entered the mainstream and business vernacular seemingly overnight, and the field has exploded over the past year, with a record $29.1 billion invested across nearly 700 deals in 2023, according to PitchBook. OpenAI’s ChatGPT first showcased the tech’s ability to produce human-like language and creative content in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has said more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted the platform, spanning industries such as financial services, legal applications and education.  Cloud providers like Amazon Web Services don’t want to be caught flat-footed.  It’s a symbiotic relationship. As part of the agreement, Anthropic said it will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. It will also use Amazon chips to train, build and deploy its foundation models. Amazon has been designing its own chips that may eventually compete with Nvidia.   Microsoft has been on its own spending spree with a high-profile investment into OpenAI. Microsoft’s OpenAI bet has reportedly jumped to $13 billion as the startup’s valuation has topped $29 billion. Microsoft’s Azure is also OpenAI’s exclusive provider for computing power, which means the startup’s success and new business flows back to Microsoft’s cloud servers.  Google, meanwhile, has also backed Anthropic, with its own deal for Google Cloud. It agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic, comprising a $500 million cash infusion, with another $1.5 billion to be invested over time. Salesforce is also a backer.  Anthropic’s new model suite, announced earlier this month, marks the first time the company has offered “multimodality,” or adding options like photo and video capabilities to generative AI.  But multimodality, and increasingly complex AI models, also lead to more potential risks. Google recently took its AI image generator, part of its Gemini chatbot, offline after users discovered historical inaccuracies and questionable responses, which circulated widely on social media.  Anthropic’s Claude 3 does not generate images: instead, it only allows users to upload images and other documents for analysis.  “Of course no model is perfect, and I think that’s a very important thing to say upfront,” Anthropic co-founder Daniela Amodei told CNBC earlier this month. “We’ve tried very diligently to make these models the intersection of as capable and as safe as possible. Of course there are going to be places where the model still makes something up from time to time.”  Amazon’s biggest venture bet before Anthropic was electric vehicle maker Rivian, where it invested more than $1.3 billion. That too, was a strategic partnership.   These partnerships have been picking up in the face of more antitrust scrutiny. A drop in acquisitions by the Magnificent Seven — Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla — has been offset by an increase in venture-style investing, according to Pitchbook.  AI and machine-learning investments from those seven tech companies jumped to $24.6 billion last year, up from $4.4 billion in 2022, according to Pitchbook. At the same time, Big Tech’s M&A deals fell from 40 deals in 2022 to 13 last year.   “There is a sort of paranoia motivation to invest in potential disruptors,” Pitchbook AI analyst, Brendan Burke, said in an interview. “The other motivation is to increase sales, and to invest in companies that are likely to use the other company’s product — they tend to be partners, more so than competitors.”  Big Tech’s spending spree in AI has come under fire for the seemingly circular nature of these agreements. By investing in AI startups, some, including Benchmark’s Bill Gurley have accused the tech giants of funneling cash back to their cloud businesses, which in turn, may show up as revenue. Gurley described it as a way to “goose your own revenues.”  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is taking a closer look at these partnerships, including Microsoft’s OpenAI deal and Google and Amazon’s Anthropic investments. What’s sometimes called “round tripping” can be illegal — especially if the aim is to mislead investors. But Amazon has said that this type of venture investing does not constitute round tripping.  FTC Chair Lina Khan announced the inquiry during the agency’s tech summit on AI, describing it as a “market inquiry into the investments and partnerships being formed between AI developers and major cloud service providers.”  Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/27/amazon-spends-2point7b-on-startup-anthropic-in-largest-venture-investment.html";"634";"2024-03-27T17:54:55"

"Reddit files to list IPO on NYSE under the ticker RDDT";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1axgrww/reddit_files_to_list_ipo_on_nyse_under_the_ticker/";"Social media company Reddit filed its IPO prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday after a yearslong run-up. The company plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “RDDT.”  Its market debut, expected in March, will mark the first major tech initial public offering of the year. It’s the first social media IPO since Pinterest went public in 2019.  Reddit first filed a confidential draft of its public offering prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2021.  The social media company, founded in 2005 by technology entrepreneurs Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, has raised about $1.3 billion in funding and has a post valuation of $10 billion, according to deal-tracking service PitchBook.  Publishing giant Condé Nast bought Reddit in 2006 and then spun it out as an independent company in 2011.  As of October, Reddit had 70 million daily active users and over 100,000 active communities, or subreddits, according to its corporate website. Reddit is one of the most-visited websites in the U.S., according to analytics firm Semrush, but it has struggled to build an online advertising business comparable to tech giants like Facebook-parent Meta and Google-parent Alphabet.  It’s also faced challenges with developers and moderators.  In June, several prominent Reddit moderators locked subreddits as part of a blackout to protest the company’s decision to increase the price third-party developers pay to use its application programming interface, or API. At the time, Reddit said the pricing change was necessary because many big tech companies were using data to train large language models.

Nvidia’s shares have to hold above $404.86 to maintain that distinction throughout the day. The chipmaker’s stock rocketed last week after it posted quarterly earnings with top- and bottom-line numbers that significantly beat consensus estimates. Nvidia’s gain buoyed other chipmakers, with the notable exception of Intel, and was also fueled in part by estimates that were more optimistic than expected.  Significantly, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 alone. Expected sales were 50% higher than consensus estimates of $7.15 billion. It’s been a banner year for chipmakers, parts of the tech industry and the Nasdaq, driven in part by the AI frenzy and the possibility of slowing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Alongside Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were also buoyed in last week’s trading.  Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, are critical to generative AI platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard. The company has historically been a leader in the so-called “discrete” or standalone GPU field, but until recently, many consumers thought of GPUs as primarily used for intensive gaming. The advent of crypto mining and AI has upended that belief, and GPU manufacturers and suppliers, including Nvidia, AMD and TSMC, have seen share prices rise significantly over the last few months. By contrast, Intel, which struggled with inventory issues and development challenges, has been historically focused on the chip market for central processing units, or CPUs. The company hasn’t shared, comparatively, in the wave of investor interest.";"1431";"2023-05-30T15:56:48"

"Apple beats estimates thanks to iPhone and services, but records fourth consecutive quarterly sales decline";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17md16v/apple_beats_estimates_thanks_to_iphone_and/";"[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/02/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/02/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q4-2023.html)  Apple    reported fourth fiscal quarter earnings on Thursday that beat analyst expectations for sales and earnings per share, but revealed that overall sales fell for the fourth quarter in a row. Every hardware business outside the iPhone declined year-over-year, with big drops in the iPad and Mac segments.       Apple highlighted stronger-than-expected 16% growth in its online services division to make up for weakness in hardware sales.        Apple shares fell less than 1% in extended trading.      Here’s how Apple did, versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations:       EPS: $1.46 per share, versus $1.39 per share expected    Revenue: $89.50 billion, versus $89.28 billion expected    iPhone revenue: $43.81 billion, versus $43.81 billion expected    Mac revenue: $7.61 billion versus $8.63 billion expected    iPad revenue: $6.44 billion, versus $6.07 billion expected    Wearables revenue: $9.32 billion, versus $9.43 billion expected    Services revenue: $22.31 billion, versus $21.35 billion expected    Gross margin: 45.2% versus 44.5% expected    Apple didn’t give formal guidance, but CFO Luca Maestri usually provides data points on the earnings call. Analysts are looking for $122.98 billion in revenue for the December quarter, which would be a return to year-over-year growth in Apple’s most important quarter.        Net income was $22.96 billion, versus $20.72 billion in net income a year ago. For Apple’s entire fiscal year, it reported $383.29 billion in sales, down about 3% from Apple’s fiscal 2022. Quarterly revenue declined less than 1% in the September quarter.       The company’s iPhone sales were in line with Wall Street expectations and increased more than 2% from last year. It was the only hardware line for Apple to show growth in the quarter, and the period only included about a week of iPhone 15 sales.        Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC that the iPhone 15 was doing better than the iPhone 14 did during the September quarter last year.        “If you look at iPhone 15 for that period of time and compare it to iPhone 14 for the same time in the year-ago quarter, iPhone 15 did better than iPhone 14,” Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach. He added that Apple’s more expensive Pro and Pro Max iPhones were supply constrained because of high demand.        Apple’s Mac and iPad businesses both suffered during the quarter. Maestri, Apple’s CFO, had warned on a call with analysts after third-quarter results that iPad and Mac sales would fall by double-digit percentages.       Mac sales came in below Wall Street expectations, falling nearly 34% on an annual basis. Apple held an unusual nighttime launch event for its new MacBook Pro laptops and iMac desktop last month. While sales of the new devices aren’t included in the quarter, Apple was signaling that new products could boost sales once again thanks to its new M3 chips.       Cook told CNBC that the Mac comparison is to “an all-time record” fourth quarter, which followed a huge supply disruption and pushed what would have been third-quarter sales into the last quarter of 2022. “So, the comparison point here is very difficult,” he said.       “I think the Mac is going to have a significantly better quarter in the December quarter. We’ve got the M3, we’ve got the new products, and we don’t have the compare phenomenon on a year-over-year basis,” Cook said, referring to an unusually strong market for Macs in 2022.        Cook said that that overall market for personal computers is “challenging.”       Revenue from iPads was also down big, declining 10% from the same period last year. Apple did not announce new products ahead of the holiday season this year.        Apple’s services business was a bright spot. Apple recorded $22.31 billion in services revenue, outpacing analyst expectations and increasing over 16% on an annual basis.        Apple’s services division includes online subscriptions like iCloud storage and Apple Music, as well as warranties from AppleCare. A big chunk of Apple’s services business comes from its deal with Google for the default search engine on Apple’s browser, Safari, which has been highlighted in recent weeks as part of the Department of Justice antitrust case against Google. That payment to Apple is worth an estimated $19 billion this year.       Cook said services components including App Store sales, advertising (including the Google deal), iCloud, payment services, and Apple Music did well in the quarter and hit an internal Apple record, signaling continued growth.       “Every main service hit a record,” Cook said.        Maestri also noted in a statement that Apple’s installed base of devices, or the number of iPhones, Macs, and iPads currently in active use, reached an all-time high during the quarter, although Apple did not give an exact number. Analysts say that growth in Apple’s installed base signals future growth in its services division.        Cook said that Apple had over a billion paid subscriptions, which include both Apple’s own services as well as apps on the App Store that bill on a recurring basis.        Apple’s wearables business unit includes headphones like the company’s AirPods as well as Apple Watch sales. It, too, shrank year-over-year, dropping over 3% on an annual basis.        Apple’s business in Greater China, its third largest market, is under the microscope as investors worry about increased competition from Huawei. Greater China sales were basically flat year-over-year, and Apple reported $15.08 billion from the region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.        Apple said it would pay a dividend of 24 cents per share this month and said the company had spent $25 billion during the quarter on share repurchases and dividends.  ";"667";"2023-11-02T21:34:03"

Tesla is actively reducing the prices on their EVs while other automakers can barely make a profit with their higher prices. I think they are just so far ahead of the competition that they will increase their market share along with the entire EV market growing.  Nvidia is obviously the king of AI right now and probably for the foreseeable future. Their forward PE is 40 and not too high for a growth stock. I don't see any real competitors, maybe AMD, but that's a stretch.  Microsoft is in an interesting spot. They acquired OpenAI and incorporated that in Bing. I'm not sure what direction they're trying to go with that. I'm not convinced they can take any meaningful market share from Google. I think Cloud and Gaming is where they will see huge growth in the near term.  If I were to pick one I would choose Tesla.";"97";"2023-09-26T20:22:31"

He is not a 100m sprinter, but a relentless marathon runner. It says his long term strategy.  As his core business is insurance, I am pretty sure that Warren Buffett though about all these potential risks before his decision to invest in AAPL.   That´s how an insurance company works by analyzing all possible and potential risks (  &#x200B:  The another argument why he is not selling is: He can´t sell (if he would like to..)  **He can't sell because a very high percentage of his capital tied down in Apple consists of embedded capital gains, over 80% at present market prices, meaning that if he sold, the IRS would take a huge chunk of Berkshire's capital in taxes.**  The future will be like Coca Cola or American Express.   But as I said: He does not want to sell in real, because all potential risks facing now were considered by his own ""due dilligence"" before investing in Apple.   &#x200B:  And you know: Warren Buffett HATES paying taxes.   Apple´s narrative is still there. The fundamentals are strong and solid.   &#x200B:  However, Apple also brings some risks with their recent strategy:  &#x200B:  1. Apple plans to launch ads on TV+ 2. Apple plans to launch AI-driven ads on App Store. 3. Not sure what Apple will launch at WWDC.  &#x200B:  Their ad business is critical, because it is a contradiction of what Apple appeals for consumer´s privacy.   Ad means tracking users.   &#x200B:  But Apple may lose $20 billion contract which has been paid by Google for their search on iOS if Google loses the antitrust case.   Apple also needs to allow all developers + consumers to sideload on App Store in the EU.   &#x200B:  Apple must cover all these potential losses by bringing ads on TV+ and App Store.   But Apple may face a lot of sensitive consumers and loyal consumers due to a potential privacy issue.   &#x200B:  It is clear: Apple becomes less attractive than before.  &#x200B:  AI is a ""buzzword"" and how AI will increase the productivity (if the productivity is given, what % increase of the productivity???), nobody knows.  But the market seems to bet on a 100% or 200% productivity increase driven by AI, which may end with a carnage and huge disappointment.   &#x200B:  But Apple needs to deliver ""WOW""-effects at WWDC.

"Amazon stock analysis: Why it's my only holding in my portfolio";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ah1ift/amazon_stock_analysis_why_its_my_only_holding_in/";"I'm more bullish on Amazon today than I was two days ago. Even though their stock price has increased by 6% in after markets. I think Amazon is valued less today than before their earnings. Their earnings were that good. I'll share with you my thoughts on Amazon and why my investing portfolio will change form 80% Amazon and 20% Google to 100% Amazon the second the market opens.  Let's have a look at all their revenue streams very briefly.  AWS. Cloud computing. In the words of Andy Jassy: a technology that will change businesses around the world with the same amount of impact the invention of electricity had on businesses. Businesses are only just now starting to adopt. We are still early in the early phases of cloud computing. AWS hit 90 billion in sales this year. And their last two quarters AWS had an operating income of 30%. AWS is getting more reasons to adopt and more reasons to increase spending by their customers due to the many AI solutions it offers to companies. It's safe to say AWS will hit 100 billion in revenue next year and that this will bring in around 30 billion in operating income. Many people are scared that AWS will have their customers stolen by Azure. Firstly, 90% of the cloud engineers I talk to, prefer AWS. Secondly, it costs a ton of money to set up cloud infrastructure for businesses. Why would they throw all their money away and spend this once again to make a switch to a different cloud provider. The majority of the current customers Amazon has aren't going anywhere. You can basically look at it as a subscription. Lastly on AWS, AWS has 6 times more server capacity than the next 12 competitors combined.  Advertising. Many people tend to forget how big Amazon advertising is. It generated $47 billion in the last twelve months and it's growing at 27% year on year. That means if there are 3 more years of 25% growth we are nearing an other nearly 100 billion revenue stream. And although we don't know their margins on advertising we know nearly certainly that it's generating higher profit margins than Meta or Google due to the fact that Amazon advertising is way more targeted. Oh you're looking at Amazon.com to buy a BBQ? Here's and advertisement of a BBQ. The cost per click on those type of ads will be very high.  Warehouse and logistics. This is the least sexy side of the business, but because of the amount of revenue it's still up there potential wise. Amazon online stores and third party sellers generated $410 billion in revenue in 2023. Amazon is the leader in logistics robotics. This has not only been told by Amazon, but this was dropped in the FedEx earnings call a few quarters back. Amazon is the company that will offer the best solutions as of now. They will most likely first fulfill their own needs and afterwards export their robotics to other parties for profit although now we are getting way ahead of ourselves as Amazon still hasn't impacted their own margins. Fulfillment cost used to hover around 27% of the product sales in 2020. After Covid, Amazon invested heavily in infrastructure for logistics. This increases maintenance and the need of personnel. Also they grew too much and too fast decreasing their margins. Their fulfillment cost was 31% of product sales in 2021, 35% in 2022 peaking at 37% in Q1 2023 and now ending Q4 2023 at 34% averaging once again 35% of the net product sales being the cost of fulfillment for the full year of 2023. But we see a decrease. Amazon went from 37% in Q1 2023 to now 34% in Q4 2023. This may not seem like a lot but when we are talking about such big numbers that this has significant impact. If Amazon would get their total fulfillment cost percentage compared to net product sales down to 33% for a full year this would leave Amazon with an extra 6 billion operating income. If Amazon would get the percentage down to 30% this would mean $13.5 billion more operating income than FY2023. If Amazon would get back to their previous 27%. This would mean a total of $21 billion more operating income. And keeping their current price to operating cash flow of 20 in mind (which is low compared to the historic mean of 27) an increase of $21 billion in a year means an increase of $420 billion in market cap. Keeping automation in mind I think they should have little trouble getting back to their old percentage of 27% in the next three to five years.  Amazon Prime, now the majority of prime members are coming from the US, Europe is only just now receiving prime content from their own country and advertisements to subscribe to prime. I'm located in the Netherlands we had a company that is comparable to Amazon for online products for here and Belgium way before Amazon arrived here. Amazon has been in the Netherlands since 2014 but they are just now completely blowing the competitor out of the water. Since one year me and many others are only using Amazon and now we are seeing ads to subscribe to prime. Subscribing to prime is only valuable if you actually make use of the logistics side of things. But it helps if prime has other things to offer as well. That's where we get to my next point. Prime video is partnering up with lots of famous people here to make Prime content. And the content isn't bad at all. That prime content hasn't even been rolling out for 6 months. Prime is just in its infancy for many countries it has recently moved into. Like I said Amazon is here since 2014 but only now I'm seeing Dutch shows on Amazon prime and having lots of people ask me to share my prime account with them. I'm sure the Netherlands wont be alone in this, it will be all the other countries as well. And guess what Amazon prime just received an additional big revenue stream, advertising. All users will receive advertisements unless they pay a few dollars a month to not see ads. Netflix earns more per subscriber that's on the cheaper subscription with ads than it does on the more expensive subscription without ads.  Additionally Amazon International gets even less love. Understandable though it's less revenue and barley sees a positive quarter. But what people forget is that it took Amazon US 10 years to turn profitable. So why do we think that International will be any faster, especially considering there is less infrastructure in countries outside of the US. I'd say we might need to wait 15 years for those countries to start making a profit. So which countries have been operational for longer than 15 years? The United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, China and Canada. Which countries have been operational for less than 15 years? Italy, Spain, Brazil, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore, Australia, Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Poland, Egypt and Belgium. We don't only need time for Amazon to build out the infrastructure. The middleclass in many of these countries is still growing which will increase activity in buying. And lastly, we need to give Amazon time to make Amazon prime subscription a valuable subscription in these countries by adding local content to Prime Video.  Amazon infrastructure, like I previously mentioned AWS has 6 times the server capacity compared to the next 12 competitors. Amazon is spending by far the most on renewable energy sources. They spent $2.5 billion on renewable energy, all to power their delivery vans and their servers. Although it may not seem huge but generating their in house electricity is bound to save them billions in the long run. Also Amazon is making their own chips for their AWS servers, they don't depend on a different party to be able to deliver. This in turn also increases their margins.  Lastly, Amazon is not sitting still. They have Amazon Gaming, Project Kuiper which has 3.000 satellites in orbit, they are making a plan to revolutionize the healthcare system and make it more cost and time efficient. They say in their call that they are still investing money to look for the next big pillar of Amazon, something that will be as big as AWS, advertising or Prime. They're not sitting still.  Okay story wise, I might have convinced you by now. But you could say, this is all a bunch of promising words. What about their valuation? Due to the fact Amazon invests a lot of their cash flow Amazon has usually been valued based on their price to operating cash flow. If we take the current after market price of Amazon of $169. Their current price to operating cash flow is at 20.6. This is 15% lower than what it was 2 days ago and this is 35% lower compared to their historical median price to operating cash flow of 27. Now this doesn't per se have to mean they will ever get back to that median price to operating cash flow so lets look at some different valuation methods. Remember Paypal was attractive to many people because it was ""only at a PE of 30"" instead of the usual 60. So lets keep on looking.  In Q4 of 2023 alone Amazon produced $30 billion free cash flow. Now Q4 is always a record quarter so we can't multiply this by 4. Q3 of 2023 Amazon had a free cash flow of $10 billion. This was still a quarter where many of their cost saving initiatives hadn't yet fully come to fruition, so although it was a much better quarter than Q2 which generated 6 billion in free cash flow. I'm very certain that Q3 free cash flow will be more in line with upcoming quarter. If we multiply 10 billion by 3 and 30 billion once. That's a free cash flow of 60 billion. This would be their free cash flow in 2024 if they don't grow, don't further increase margins and don't continue to lessen their investing of cash flow. If we take a quite reasonable (in my opinion) price to free cash flow of 30 times we see that Amazon stock should be valued at 1800 billion market cap. That's pretty much where the marketcap is at right now. Although I'm a firm believer that Amazon will grow in 2024. Let's not forget they are giving all their prime members ads from now on, or the ability to pay more for no ads. This alone will generate around 2 billion free cash flow in my estimation. Other than that I'm expecting Amazon to grow it's already existing revenue streams further, increase its margin further and decrease CAPEX. Which should result in record free cash flow in 2024. I'm estimating 12 billion in Q1, 13 billion in Q2, 15 billion in Q3 and 38 billion in Q4. Now I would love to tell you that these estimations are highly calculated by me and a pack of mathematicians. But I'll have to disappoint you and say that it's not. I've been doing estimates on Amazon every quarter based on the trends I see in the numbers and the story I pair with it. I have been quite spot on with the numbers so far. If my estimation would be reasonably close it would mean a market cap of 2.340 trillion, an increase of 34% at a price to free cash flow of 30 or an increase to a market cap of 2.730, an increase of 57% at a price to free cash flow of 35. Do note Microsoft is valued at 40 times price to free cash flow. And although I think Amazon and Microsoft should be valued similarly I find it hard to justify a price to free cash flow of 40 or more if you're not growing cash flow above 20% YoY.  We could also disassemble the components of Amazon and value these components with the price to sales of a company that offers similar services. To some people this might be a bit more hocus-pocus but I like doing this to see where Amazon stands in the market compared to other stocks. I'm using price to sales in this example because sadly we do not know the operating income on Amazon advertising and on Amazon Prime.  AWS had a total sales in FY 2023 of $90 billion. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Microsoft of 13 times. Resulting in AWS having a marketcap of $1,170 billion.  Amazon advertising has a total sales in FY 2023 of $47 billion. Lets get the average price to sales of two companies for this one. Google of 6 times price to sales and Meta of 8 times. Thus we multiply by 7. Resulting in Amazon advertising having a marketcap of $329 billion. Even though Amazon advertising has higher margins and is growing faster than Google and Meta.  Next up Amazon Prime had a total sales of $40 billion in FY 2023. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Netflix of 7.5. Resulting in Amazon Prime having a marketcap of $300 billion.  Lastly Amazon online stores, physical stores and logistics services offered to third party sellers generated a total revenue of 392$ billion in FY 2023. Lets take a price to sales of 0.70 based on the price to sales of Walmart at 0.71 and the price to sales of FedEx at 0.69. Resulting in a market cap of $274 billion dollars.  If we calculate all the components together we have a total market cap from Amazon of 2.073 trillion. An increase of 18.5% form the current prices. And this is based on historic number, not forward looking. Similarly when using the price to operating cash flow Amazon had two days ago of 23 we see that Amazon's stock is valued at a 15% cheaper price now than just two days ago. Supporting the argument that Amazon is more less 15% undervalued based on current prices, not forward looking expectations. This is why I moved my Google position into Amazon. As Google is looking undervalued by 15% on forward looking prices, but Amazon is looking undervalued by the same amount based on historic prices. Meaning if we expect Amazon to do slightly better in the future Amazon is a better buy than Google.  TLDR: I think Amazon is undervalued by 15% based on historic numbers. Forward looking though, I expect Amazon to be more less undervalued by around 30% - 50% based on end of on end of FY 2024 numbers. This is based on how well they execute increasing their margins, decreasing CAPEX and continuing their business trends growth wise.";"233";"2024-02-02T12:25:46"

However, to the bulls out there, what is the reason for such a MASSIVE premium for this stock?  I understand they crushed earnings and increased foecast to a nearly 50% gain in revenue by Q1 2024, but even with that premium, they are trading at a nearly 200 P/E.    Assuming NVDA maintains that 50% premium and holds it for all 4-quarters in 2024, thats $44B in revenue which if they had 100% margins and zero cost of any kind, it would take you almost 22 years to payback the value of the stock.   Sure, someone will tell me P/Es don't matter, and they are growing like crazy, but at what point is the value of the stock (again, almost $1 TRILLION) still out of control?   \- Their Gross Profit is 56% which is impressive, but not unherd of (MSFT is 68%, META is 80%)    \- Their net income is 16% which is right in line with everyones favoriate not a car company TESLA at 15%  Lets throw out fundamentals since they clearly don't matter that much for this stock and look at their growth:  $7.19B (lower than Q1 2022 of $8.29B).    Their Q4 22 Revenue was $6.05B vs. Q4 21 of $7.64B  So grow is slower/stagnant from the previsous years, so why does that get such a massive premium?  Did they beat earnings estimates, yes, but those were concervitive.  Did they raise guidance by 50% due to the AI boom, yeah, how long will that last?  Same length as the gaming/crypto/at home boom?

I've set order buy limits before for my stocks owned and it has always worked out pretty well as my stock would got auto-sold during the trading day at just the high price I want before the price ends up much lower at closing day.  And it seems stock prices tend to inevitably flunctuate upwards somewhat during the day at the very least...no matter how marginal.  So I was just thinking, why not I just set limit orders  all the time to make profits?  For example, I notice Google stocks tend to flunctuate between $1-2 esch day.   So if I use $100k to buy 715 google stocks at $140 each right now, then immediately set an order to sell off all stocks at $141... that's an easy $715 profit for me, right? The profit should be guaranteed given it is extremely likely for the stock to increase by a mere $1 during the trading day.

Edit:  - I can qualify this because I am an AI researcher/ work in it  - not recommending anyone buys the companies that are  public and able to capitalize on AI applications as it's likely already very priced in (unless Google announces a new robot assistant- that would be crazy). I'm sure there will be more companies going public with this theme. A good future picks and shovels play could be AI specific hardware.

Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month, according to a regulatory disclosure Thursday.      The transactions on the filing, marked with ""SP"" for the spouse, indicate that Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options purchased on May 24, 2022, with a listed expiration date of June 16.      The Apple options had a strike price of $80, and the Microsoft options had a strike price of $180. On Friday, those shares closed at $186.68 and $335.02, respectively, totaling about $933,000 and $1.7 million.      Since the options were purchased last May, Apple shares have gained 33%, and Microsoft has climbed 29%. The upside from the strike price is even higher, at 131% and 83%, respectively.      First highlighted by Quiver Quantitative and Unusual Whales, the disclosure comes after Congress failed to make progress on new legislation around lawmakers and their relatives trading stocks.      Earlier this year, Insider and several other news organizations identified 78 members of Congress who didn't properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act.      Congress passed the law a decade ago to combat insider trading and conflicts of interest. But many lawmakers have not fully complied with reporting requirements, leading to calls for a complete ban on trading individual stocks among members of Congress.      Legislation on such a ban advanced last year, but the bill ultimately died.      Meanwhile, Paul Pelosi has faced backlash over stock trades that seem to coincide with legislation in the technology sector.      For example, in July 2021, he pocketed a $4.8 million gain in a Alphabet stock trade the week before the House Judiciary Committee advanced bipartisan antitrust bills targeting Google, Apple, and Amazon.      However, Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly that her financier husband's trades have nothing to do with her political knowledge.

This made me actually go look at the form 13F to see what ""some"" means.     In the Q4 2023 13F, Berkshire Hathaway owned 905,560,000 shares of AAPL. ([source](https://13f.info/13f/000095012324002518-berkshire-hathaway-inc-q4-2023))   In the Q3 2023 13F, they owned 915,560,382 shares of AAPL. ([source](https://13f.info/13f/000095012323011029-berkshire-hathaway-inc-q3-2023-restatement))     This means, ""some"" equals 1.092%.     Also, AAPL still accounts for 50.19% of their total investment portfolio, down from 50.04% compared to the previous filing which is a 0.29% relative decrease.";"405";"2024-02-27T16:59:36"
"Micron Stock Tumbles as China Says Its Chips Are Security Risk";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13olpot/micron_stock_tumbles_as_china_says_its_chips_are/";"Micron Technology Inc.’s stock dropped more than 6% after China’s cyberspace regulator said that its products failed to pass a cybersecurity review in the country.  Beijing warned operators of key infrastructure against buying the company’s goods, saying it found “relatively serious” cybersecurity risks in Micron products sold in the country. The components caused “significant security risks to our critical information infrastructure supply chain,” which would affect national security, according to the statement from the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC.Micron’s shares dropped as much as 6.8% in premarket trading, which would be the biggest intraday fall since November if it holds during regular trading. The stock had gained 36% this year, closing at $68.17 on Friday.  The CAC had said about six weeks ago that it was launching a security review of imports from Micron, the US’s last major memory chipmaker.  The tech sector has become a key battlefield over national security between the two largest economies, with Washington having already blacklisted Chinese tech firms, cut off the flow of sophisticated processors and banned its citizens from providing certain help to the Chinese chip industry. In a statement, the US Commerce Department said Beijing’s conclusion had “no basis in fact” and Washington will continue to try and limit industry disruptions with its allies.  **US Chipmakers Are Heavily Reliant on China**  Micron is less dependent on the country than many of its peersPercent of revenue from China  * Qualcomm: 64% * Broadcom: 35% * Intel: 27% * AMD: 22% * Nvidia: 21% * Micron: 11%  ^(Source: Company data compiled by BloombergNote: In some cases, China revenue includes chips for devices that are exported for sale elsewhere)  “No one should understand this decision by CAC as anything but retaliation for the US’s export controls on semiconductors,” said Holden Triplett, founder of Trenchcoat Advisors and a former FBI counterintelligence official in Beijing. “No foreign business operating in China should be deceived by this subterfuge. These are political actions pure and simple, and any business could be the next one to be made an example of.”  The move brings fresh uncertainty to the other US chipmakers that sell to China, the world’s biggest market for semiconductors. Companies like Qualcomm Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Intel Corp. deliver billions of chips to the country, which puts the components inside electronic products that are shipped all over the world.  The Chinese cyber agency said in its statement Sunday that, while the country welcomes products and services provided by companies of all countries as long as they comply with its laws and regulations, the investigation into Micron products are a “necessary measure” to safeguard national security. It didn’t detail what the security risks were or identify specific Micron products that are now barred.Micron, which has previously said it stood by the security of its products and commitments to customers, said in a statement Sunday it’s evaluating the conclusion of the review. The company is assessing its next steps, adding that it looks forward “to continuing to engage in discussions with Chinese authorities.”  Analysts at Jefferies including Edison Lee said in a research report that the CAC’s decision will likely have a small impact on Micron because it focuses on “critical information infrastructure,” meaning operations like data centers and cloud computing services with security risks. Most of Micron’s memory chips sold in China are actually used in consumer electronics, like smartphones and notebooks, they said.  “We believe this ban is narrowly focused as it applies to only CII operators,” they wrote. “Therefore, the ultimate impact on Micron will be quite limited.”  Source: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-22/micron-stock-tumbles-as-china-says-its-chips-are-security-risk?utm\_source=google&utm\_medium=bd&cmpId=google](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-22/micron-stock-tumbles-as-china-says-its-chips-are-security-risk?utm_source=google&utm_medium=bd&cmpId=google)";"221";"2023-05-22T11:18:14"
"Amazon to invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, a rival to ChatGPT developer OpenAI";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16rmvdx/amazon_to_invest_up_to_4_billion_in_anthropic_a/";"E-commerce giant Amazon on Monday said it will invest up to $4 billion in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic and take a minority ownership position in the company.The move underscores Amazon’s aggressive AI push as it looks to keep pace with rivals such as Microsoft and Alphabet’sGoogle.  Anthropic was founded roughly two years ago by former OpenAI research executives and recently debuted its new AI chatbot called Claude 2. Amazon is looking to capitalize on the hype and promise of so-called generative AI, which includes technology like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, as well as Anthropic’s Claude chatbots.  The two firms on Monday said that they are forming a strategic collaboration to advance generative AI, with the startup selecting Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider. Anthropic said it will provide AWS customers with early access to unique features for model customization and fine-tuning capabilities.  Anthropic will also use custom AWS-designed semiconductors to train the foundational models that underpin its AI applications. Foundation models are large AI programs trained on vast amounts of data so that they can be adapted to solve a wide range of tasks.   This year, chip firm Nvidia is the chip firm that has seen the biggest gains from the generative AI boom. Nvidia’s key product is a type of semiconductor known as a graphics processing unit, which can be used to train huge AI models. At one point Nvidia’s stock had rallied more than 200%, as the company smashed through financial forecasts on the rising adoption of AI.  To an extent, Amazon’s deal with Anthropic aims to show that there are alternative chips that can be used for AI applications. AWS customers will be able to build on Anthropic’s AI models via Amazon Bedrock — a service that lets customers build generative AI applications in the cloud via existing models, rather than train their own models.  Amazon is looking to position itself as the one-stop shop for AI. The e-commerce giant designs its own chips for training huge AI models. Through Amazon Bedrock customers can also design their own generative AI applications using existing models, which are all run on the Amazon cloud. The company sells its own AI applications too.  Anthropic already counts some high-profile backers, including Google and Salesforce Ventures. This support comes as tech giants continue to make massive bets on AI companies, a move sparked by Microsoft’s multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI in January.  https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/25/amazon-to-invest-up-to-4-billion-in-anthropic-a-rival-to-chatgpt-developer-openai.html";"461";"2023-09-25T11:01:26"

"The Verge - Sam Altman fired as CEO of OpenAI";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17xolry/the_verge_sam_altman_fired_as_ceo_of_openai/";"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/17/23965982/openai-ceo-sam-altman-fired  * Sam Altman has been fired as CEO of OpenAI, the company announced on Friday.   * Former OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is leaving after a ‘deliberative review process’ by the company’s board.  * Altman has largely been the face of OpenAI  “Mr. Altman’s departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities,” the company said in its blog post. “The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI.”   Chief technology officer Mira Murati will be the interim CEO. The company will be conducting a search for the permanent CEO successor. A spokesperson for OpenAI didn’t immediately return The Verge’s call for comment.   This is an extremely sudden turn of events. Just last week, Altman keynoted at the company’s DevDay conference, where it announced a suite of major new updates to compete with other big tech companies like Microsoft and Google. OpenAI arguably kickstarted the current AI arms race with last year’s hugely-popular ChatGPT.  Microsoft, which has invested billions in OpenAI, tells The Verge it will continue to partner with the company. “We have a long-term partnership with OpenAI and Microsoft remains committed to Mira and their team as we bring this next era of AI to our customers,” according to a statement sent by Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw.  Altman has reportedly talked with Jony Ive, Apple’s former chief design officer, about making the “iPhone of artificial intelligence,” though Altman downplayed those rumors at a recent Wall Street Journal conference. He’s also the biggest shareholder in Humane, which just launched orders for its Humane AI Pin.  Altman was a co-founder of OpenAI and initially served as a co-chair of the company alongside Elon Musk. Musk left in 2018 to avoid a conflict of interest with Tesla.   OpenAI also announced that co-founder Greg Brockman will be stepping down as chairman of the board, though Brockman will remain at the company.";"973";"2023-11-17T21:45:15"

Moreover, traders bracing for another hotter-than-expected reading on inflation were calmed after the Federal Reserve's preferred price gauge largely matched estimates.  &#x200B:  The benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) climbed 1.02% to close at 5,099.81 points. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (COMP:IND) surged 2.03% to settle at 15,927.90 points and notched its best day since February 22. The blue-chip Dow (DJI) lagged the other two indexes in terms of gains, but still rose 0.40% to conclude at 38,239.66 points.     Of the 11 S&P sectors, six ended in the green. Communication Services saw an outsized jump of nearly 5%, boosted by Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL). The two tech giants on Thursday delivered quarterly results that cemented their dominance in the AI race. Investors took heart from the reports, especially after soft guidance from Meta Platforms (META) and its heavy spending on AI had sent alarm bells ringing. The Google-parent's stock in particular clocked a double-digit rise on Friday after top boss Sundar Pichai touted that the company was ""well under way with"" its Gemini era, referring to its AI model.     The other major event today was the release of personal income and outlays data for March. The report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index - the Fed's favored inflation gauge - rose 0.3% M/M in March, matching the +0.3% consensus and flat from February's pace. On a Y/Y basis, the core PCE price index rose 2.8%, topping the +2.7% consensus but unchanged from February.     With hotter-than-expected consumer price index reports recently along with Thursday's data that showed a higher-than-anticipated jump in the Q1 core PCE price index, market participants were bracing for the worst coming into today's announcement. The largely in-line result alleviated some concerns that interest rate cuts were almost entirely off the table for 2024.     ";"77";"2024-04-26T23:14:11"

Lately, I've been investing more in individual stocks that are undervalued, as opposed to putting it in ETF's that are at ATH. Thus far, my strategy has outperformed the overall market by quite a bit. I'm up 20% since starting this strategy about 6 months ago, versus the overall market being up by about 10% in the same time period. Yes, I understand there's inherently more risk with individual stocks. Also, FWIW, I'm not bragging, just giving some depth to the conversation and my reasoning for asking these questions.

Im looking for crowd favorites for individual stock holdings. So my question to you all is this: For those who don't have *all* of their money in ETF's, what is the single stock you hold the most of? How much of that holding represents your overall portfolio? Are these long-term holdings, or have you purchased shares lately? Why is that particular stock your largest individual holding?

Wondering if this is a good idea or if there are maybe some ETFs that are available in Europe?";"22";"2024-03-09T10:23:45"
"Microsoft earnings are out – here are the numbers";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/159jfo6/microsoft_earnings_are_out_here_are_the_numbers/";"Microsoft reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.  Here are the key numbers to follow:  Earnings: $2.69 a share. That may not compare with the $2.55 cents per share expected by Refinitiv.  Revenue:  $56.19 billion. That may not compare with the $55.47 billion expected by Refinitiv.  Based on analysts’ projections, Microsoft will close fiscal 2023 with revenue growth below 10% for the first time since 2017. Growth for the latest quarter is expected to come in at around 7%. Businesses have been delaying cloud and software deployments since last year due to economic uncertainty and the potential for higher interest rates.  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees in May that the company won’t lift salaries this year.  Analysts polled by CNBC and by StreetAccount expect Microsoft to report about 25% year-over-year growth in revenue from the Azure public cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Microsoft doesn’t report Azure revenue in dollars. The projected growth rate is similar to what analysts expect from Google’s cloud division. Parent company Alphabet also reports results after the bell on Tuesday.  During the quarter, Microsoft built on its broad alliance with OpenAI to capitalize on fresh interest in artificial intelligence, following the November launch of the startup’s ChatGPT chatbot. Microsoft introduced a chatbot powered partly by OpenAI language models to help workers make sense of their employers’ data, and it told developers they’ll be able to build plugins that people can access through ChatGPT, the Bing search engine’s chatbot, and other tools.  Investors are eager for resolution in Microsoft’s arrangement to buy Activision Blizzard for almost $69 billion, which was agreed upon in January 2022. Earlier this month, an appeals court denied the Federal Trade Commission’s motion to stop the transaction. Activision shares have climbed past $92.50, close to the $95 that Microsoft agreed to pay, reflecting optimism that the deal is on track to close.  Microsoft shares have gained 44% year to date, while the S&P 500 is up 19%.  In June, Microsoft said it expected to take a $425 million charge in the quarter to pay a fine from Ireland’s Data Protection Commission after the authority looked at whether the company’s LinkedIn unit violated the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.  Executives will discuss the quarterly results with analysts and issue guidance on a conference call starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.

"Tim Cook teases Apple AI announcement ‘later this year’";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1agtkhe/tim_cook_teases_apple_ai_announcement_later_this/";"Apple CEO Tim Cook teased that Apple may have an artificial intelligence announcement later this year during a call with analysts after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings.  While Cook’s remarks on Thursday did not include many details, they did indicate that Apple wants to compete with Microsoft, Google, Amazon, OpenAI and other technology companies working on cutting-edge AI models that can generate text and images.  “As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future,” Cook said during a call with analysts. “That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we’re excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.”  Generative AI started drawing significant attention from technology companies and investors starting in 2022, after OpenAI released ChatGPT and image generators rapidly improved. Apple did not announce an advanced AI model last year, although the company has long invested in similar machine learning technology in its chips and software, which can, for example, identify people or pets inside photographs.  Apple typically announces new software in June at its annual developer’s conference, WWDC. Last year, the company announced an autocorrect feature for the iPhone keyboard based on a transformer-based language model, which shares the same underlying technology as GPT. But Apple never used the phrase “artificial intelligence” during the presentation, preferring the more academic term “machine learning.”  “Let me just say that I think there’s a huge opportunity for Apple with Gen AI and AI, without getting into more details and getting out in front of myself,” Cook said.

"FTC and 17 states sue Amazon on antitrust charges";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16ssaqy/ftc_and_17_states_sue_amazon_on_antitrust_charges/";"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/26/ftc-and-17-states-sue-amazon-on-antitrust-charges.html  * Amazon is facing its first set of antitrust charges from the U.S. federal government after the Federal Trade Commission filed its long-anticipated lawsuit against the e-commerce and cloud giant. * The lawsuit is a major milestone for FTC Chair Lina Khan, who rose to prominence for her 2017 Yale Law Journal note, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” * It’s also the culmination of several years of pressure on federal enforcers to deal with what some competitors, sellers and lawmakers have seen as anticompetitive practices.    The Federal Trade Commission has filed its long-anticipated antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.  In a sweeping complaint unveiled Tuesday, the FTC and attorneys general from 17 states accused Amazon of wielding its “monopoly power” to inflate prices, degrade quality for shoppers and unlawfully exclude rivals, thereby undermining competition.  The agency laid out a two-pronged strategy by which Amazon “unlawfully maintains” its monopoly power. It pointed to so-called anti-discounting measures the company uses to punish sellers and deter other online retailers from offering lower, more competitive prices than Amazon, which translates to keeping prices higher for products across the internet, the FTC said.  Amazon also “effectively requires” that sellers use its “costly” fulfillment services in order to obtain the vaunted Prime badge for their products, the FTC said, which in turn makes it more expensive to do business on the platform.  These tactics have degraded the shopping experience on Amazon, the FTC added, and forced sellers to pay expensive fees to market their goods on the site, while facing no other choice “but to rely on Amazon to stay in business.”  The lawsuit is a major milestone for FTC Chair Lina Khan, who rose to prominence for her 2017 Yale Law Journal note, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” Khan argued in the article that the prominent antitrust framework at the time failed to capture the true extent of Amazon’s dominance and potential harm to competition. Through her work at the FTC, Khan has sought to reset that framework and push the boundaries of antitrust law through risky legal battles.  Amazon sought Khan’s recusal from antitrust investigations into its business, arguing that her past writing and critiques showed she had prejudged the outcome of such probes.  The charges are the culmination of several years of pressure on federal enforcers to deal with what some competitors, sellers and lawmakers saw as anticompetitive practices. Amazon was one of four Big Tech companies investigated by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, which found it held monopoly power over most of its third-party sellers and many suppliers. The majority Democratic staff at the time alleged that Amazon shored up “competitive moats” by acquiring rival sites like Diapers.com and Zappos.  At the time, an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement that “large companies are not dominant by definition, and the presumption that success can only be the result of anti-competitive behavior is simply wrong.”  Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, Amazon has transformed from an online bookseller into a retail, advertising and cloud computing giant with a staggering market valuation of roughly $1.4 trillion. The company has sought to expand its dominance by entering verticals like health care, streaming, and grocery, acquiring primary care provider One Medical, legendary film and television studio MGM, and upscale supermarket chain Whole Foods.  Those moves have attracted intense regulatory scrutiny. The House subcommittee report also accused Amazon of abusing its position in online retail to harm third-party merchants who rely on the platform to sell goods, and alleged it uses “strong-arm tactics” to bully retail partners. The FTC is also reviewing Amazon’s planned $1.7 billion acquisition of Roomba maker iRobot  on antitrust grounds. Amazon recently paid roughly $30 million to settle two privacy lawsuits brought by the FTC concerning its Ring doorbell and Alexa units. The agency followed up in June with a lawsuit accusing Amazon of tricking users into signing up for Prime,  while making it too difficult for them to cancel.  Amazon’s marketplace has transformed into a linchpin of its e-commerce business since its launch in 2000. The company had already expanded beyond its origins as a bookseller to offering things like CDs and videos. But once it opened its doors to third-party sellers, it supercharged the number and variety of products for sale on its website, earning it the moniker “the everything store.”  The third-party marketplace has given Amazon access to a higher-margin business than just selling books. It has also increased the fees it charges sellers to do business on its site, run advertisements, and tap into its fulfillment and delivery services. In the first half of 2023, the company collected a 45% cut of every sale made by sellers in the U.S., up from 19% in 2014, according to the nonprofit Institute for Local Self Reliance. Sales from third-party sellers now comprise 60% of total units sold, the company recently disclosed.";"285";"2023-09-26T18:15:51"

"Snowflake (SNOW) ls worth buying on declines";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bz4fyh/snowflake_snow_ls_worth_buying_on_declines/";"I bought Snowflake #SNOW at $154 today.    **Positives:**  There is some sandbagging in the guidance for the incoming CEO to make a better mark, I don’t believe they’ve completely elaborated on likely growing revenue streams.  New CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy has an excellent resume, 15 years at Google, then he co-founded Neeva, which was bought by Snowflake. With his tech cred he actually has better product knowledge than the outgoing legendary CEO, Frank Slootman, and his tech cred should be a big factor in taking Snowflake forward.  Its partnership with Nvidia is a fairly big deal for a recurring AL/LLM solutions/services. Snowflake’s AI product, Cortex should be out in the second or third quarter of 2024. Snowflake has also responded well to Databricks comparisons and shouldn’t be seen as lagging. The other new product Snowpark should also grow a lot faster.  Snowflake’s free cash flow margin was very impressive at 35% of sales last year. Like most tech companies it doesn’t generate GAAP profits, but this a hugely positive number, it exceeds Crowdstrike’s 30% and several other tech growers. It has indicated 29% free cash flow margin for 2024.  Moving to a consumption model has shown poorer forecasted revenue growth at 22-23% but bookings are growing at much faster levels, Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) grew at 41% so this is not a long term problem.  Negatives  The company is expensive at 15x sales with only 23% growth! Even after the stock being 35% lower than its 52 week high.  It could stay sideways for a year, or if there is another weak quarter, it could drop to $130-135, where it’s down to 12-13 x sales. Look out for a bumpy ride!  ";"218";"2024-04-08T19:52:02"

"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says he's committed to cost cutting while investing in AI in shareholder letter";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1c1ckwh/amazon_ceo_andy_jassy_says_hes_committed_to_cost/";"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on Thursday published his annual shareholder letter, where he pledged to keep looking for ways to keep costs in check even as the company doubles down on investing in new growth areas like artificial intelligence.  “I think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one of our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers’ lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we’re investing,” Jassy wrote in his third shareholder letter since taking the helm at Amazon from former CEO Jeff Bezos, who stepped down in 2021.  Under Jassy, Amazon has morphed into a leaner version of itself, as slowing sales and a challenging economy pushed the company to eschew the relentless growth of the Bezos years. Beginning at the end of 2022 and continuing through 2023, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs. Those cuts have continued this year, with Amazon announcing layoffs in its cloud computing, Prime Video and Twitch livestreaming units, among others.  Even amid a period of retrenchment in some areas, Jassy said he’s focused on finding new areas of growth within the company so that Amazon remains “resilient.” He stressed the importance of building “primitive services,” which he described as “discrete, foundational building blocks” that can spur new projects and businesses.  Jassy used Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing division, as an example. Before he became Amazon’s CEO, Jassy oversaw the creation of AWS, which grew from an internal tool to become the dominant cloud service and one of Amazon’s most profitable businesses.  He said he believes generative artificial intelligence stands to be Amazon’s next “primitive service” that could transform the company. “We’re optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS,” Jassy wrote.  Amazon on Thursday added Andrew Ng, a renowned AI pioneer who previously led Google Brain and was a scientist at Baidu, to its board. Ng will replace Judy McGrath, who has sat on the board since 2014.  In the past year, Amazon has made a flurry of AI announcements as the field exploded, causing tech companies to pour money into the space. Last month, Amazon added $2.75 billion to its stake in AI startup Anthropic in its largest venture investment yet. Jassy has also pledged to infuse AI into every one of Amazon’s businesses.

"Meta’s new AI assistant is rolling out across WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1c7e9xl/metas_new_ai_assistant_is_rolling_out_across/";"Meta  on Thursday announced its free artificial intelligence assistant, Meta AI, is rolling out across its social media platforms WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.  The assistant can answer questions, create animations and generate images, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video. Meta AI was built on the company’s latest large language model called Meta Llama 3, which was also announced Thursday.  The AI tool is Meta’s competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google  Gemini but, in a unique twist, Meta has also partnered with Google and Microsoft  to provide results from both companies’ search engines.  “We believe that Meta AI is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the video.  Shares of Meta closed up more than 1% Thursday.  Meta AI is built into the search box of the WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger apps so users can easily ask questions that can be answered through the new tool.  For instance, the company said users can ask Meta AI for restaurant recommendations, help planning a vacation or inspiration to decorate a new apartment.  Meta AI is also available on the website “meta.ai,” where users can ask the assistant for help with tasks like solving a math problem or writing a professional email, according to the release. Users can log their conversations for future reference.  Meta said the assistant’s image-generation feature will be available in beta on WhatsApp and the MetaAI website. Users will see an image appear as they start typing and MetaAI will provide prompts to help change or refine the image. The images can also be animated into a GIF that users can share.  Meta first introduced Meta AI in beta at its Connect event in September. The assistant is rolling out in English across more than a dozen countries including the U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Australia, starting Thursday.

"Reddit shares soar 14% after company reports revenue pop in first earnings report";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cmmlqj/reddit_shares_soar_14_after_company_reports/";"Reddit shares rallied 14% in extended trading on Tuesday after the company released quarterly results for the first time since its IPO in March.  Here’s how the company did:  Loss per share: $8.19 loss per share. That may not compare with the $8.71 loss expected by LSEG  Revenue: $243 million vs. $212.8 million expected by LSEG  Revenue climbed 48% from $163.7 million a year earlier. The company reported $222.7 million in ad revenue for the period, up 39% year over year, which is a faster rate of growth than at its top competitors.  Digital advertising companies have started growing again at a healthy clip after brands reeled in spending to cope with inflation in 2022. Meta’s ad revenue jumped 27% in the first quarter, followed by 24% growth at Amazon and 13% growth at Google parent Alphabet.  Reddit reported a net loss of $575.1 million. Stock-based compensation expenses and related taxes were $595.5 million, primarily driven by IPO charges.  For the second quarter, Reddit expects revenue of $240 million to $255 million, topping the $224 million expected by analysts, according to LSEG. The midpoint of the guidance range suggests growth of about 32% for the second quarter, up from $183 million from a year earlier.  Reddit, which hosts millions of online forums on its platform, was founded in 2005 by Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, the company’s CEO.   “We see this as the beginning of a new chapter as we work towards building the next generation of Reddit,” Huffman said in a release Tuesday.  Reddit began trading under the ticker symbol “RDDT” on the New York Stock Exchange in March. The company priced its IPO at $34 per share, which valued the company around $6.5 billion. When tech valuations were red hot in 2021, Reddit’s private market valuation reached $10 billion.  The stock climbed past $58 in after-hours trading on Tuesday before coming back a bit. Should the stock close above $57.75 on Wednesday, it would be at its highest since March 26, its fourth day of trading. The shares closed that day at $65.11, their highest yet.  The company reported 82.7 million daily active users for its first quarter, up from the 76.6 million expected by StreetAccount. Average revenue per user worldwide rose 8% to $2.94 from $2.72 a year ago.  Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/07/reddit-rddt-q1-2024-earnings.html";"626";"2024-05-07T23:01:58"

I just dont think there is an issue getting chip anymore. The issue is creating the software for actual use of AI and generating cash flow.

"What's a good, quick way to check whether investors believe that the stock market is relatively risky?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1c5qiu5/whats_a_good_quick_way_to_check_whether_investors/";"I'm young so I have all my money invested in stocks. I'd like to check every so often whether or not the people believe that a crash might happen soon, since a crash would mean I'd have to change my life plans. I'm less looking to time the market, more looking for peace of mind.  What's a good, easy to google metric that indicates wether investors as a whole believe the market is relatively risky?  I thought that the VIX would be the best metric for this, however [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/133bz1b/the_vix_is_near_a_low_not_seen_since_2021_and_am/) has given me doubts. The relative price of safe assets (e.g. gold) seems like another good indicator, is that the best way to go?";"22";"2024-04-16T22:32:28"

It's a venture capital darling with investment firms writing magazine style articles about them.  2. All info I could find was from either Fractyl Health management or their investors.  3. They were valued by VC firms at 100 million not long ago but are now trying to IPO at +800 million.  4. They have no FDA approved drug, they have FDA approval to test two drugs.  5.

"Arm shares spike 24% after chip designer gives strong forecast, says AI is increasing sales";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1alek9u/arm_shares_spike_24_after_chip_designer_gives/";"Arm reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat estimates and gave a strong profit forecast for the current quarter. The shares soared more than 20% in extended trading.  Here’s how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending December:  Revenue: $824 million, vs. $761 million expected  EPS: 29 cents adjusted, vs 25 cents expected.   Arm, whose chip design technology is in nearly every smartphone and many PCs, said it expects earnings per share for the fiscal fourth quarter of between 28 cents and 32 cents on sales of $850 million to $900 million. Analysts expectations earnings of 21 cents per share on sales of $780 million.  The company reported net income of $87 million, or 8 cents per share. Total revenue in the quarter increased 14% from a year earlier.  Arm makes money through royalties, when companies pay for access to build Arm-compatible chips, usually amounting to a small percentage of the final chip price.  Arm said its customers shipped 7.7 billion Arm chips during the September quarter, which is the most recent period which figures are available.  Royalty revenue increased 11% on an annual basis to $470 million. The company said the jump was partially because of a recovery in the smartphone market, as well as increasing sales to automotive companies and cloud providers. Arm said that it expects growth to be driven by royalty revenue.  In recent years, Arm has emphasized its licensing business, selling access to more complete designs that semiconductor companies can take and plug into their planned chips. That process saves chipmakers time and effort, and it’s more lucrative for Arm than simply collecting royalties.  Arm’s license and other revenue was $354 million, up 18% year-over-year. Arm said more companies were choosing to license its CPU designs to run artificial intelligence, and that the company charges higher licensing fees for advanced designs.  Arm, which had been owned by SoftBank, went public in September. The company was founded in 1990 to develop technology for low-power chips, but became more important to the overall technology industry when the Apple  iPhone and competing Android devices standardized on Arm-based chips.  Arm says that companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia use its technology.  Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/07/arm-earnings-report-q3-2024-.html";"599";"2024-02-07T22:43:28"

In the meantime an announcement of their next console should be drawing near.  So personally I bought NTDOY.  Nintendo has a good track record of innovation and novelty in their console features and games. So I expect them to do something new with both VR and their next console.  However, keeping the Wii U in mind, there is a risk of these innovations and novelties not appealing to the wide market. They did believe in the idea though, and refined the Wii U into the Switch. Which in turn is a success.  But there might be some unrefined ideas in the possible VR headset, and possibly this “Switch 2” console.  Though, if Nintendo manages to make VR mainstream, it would once again be a game changer by Nintendo.  Still. Along with their great results lately, I’m taking a chance on an upside of the rumors.  I’m considering a larger position but would like to hear some input from others first. What are your thoughts?";"137";"2023-09-10T21:16:34"

"Would TSLA buy RIVN?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b1vtfa/would_tsla_buy_rivn/";"RIVN seems to be the only legit competitor to TSLA in EVs in terms of branding. I know they are the only EV brand I would buy other than TSLA.  TSLA seems to be one of the few EVs that can make profitably  TSLA has ~$30 billion in cash and easily could obtain financing. RIVN is selling for $10 billion now  It’s not uncommon for car companies to operate multiple brands.  TSLA brings in their manufacturing process to make RIVN profitable and further cements themselves as the EV leader  Edit: long TSLA own no RIVN, did own a small position sold after a quick loss of 10-20%";"0";"2024-02-28T04:24:16"
