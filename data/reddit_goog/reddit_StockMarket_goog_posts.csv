"Why Has Google Been Dropping So Much?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1b35gcg/why_has_google_been_dropping_so_much/";"Why has google dropped so much the last month almost a crazy 10%. Ytd down 2%. Seems like a steal at this discount. I understand Gemini messed up but it‚Äôs not anything crazy just some images messed up . Another factor is the inflation report, people were scared. Their q4 wasn‚Äôt the strongest but doesn‚Äôt warrant this big a drop . Idk someone help me understand why it‚Äôs tanked sm. Did they issue a lower guidance?  Anything after this is rlly just extra you dont have to read  Google is not going anywhere, why has their eps estimates decreased. Besides a bad earnings what rlly happened. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è . Their PE ratio is 23. Which is not bad. They have a bright future ahead of them. So whats going on? And in reality they didnt have a bad earnings. As of septemeber 2023 they have 23billion in debt. The company plans to relaunch Gemini AI in the next few weeks. News website Semafor first reported the news, which was later confirmed by a Google spokesperson.  Youtube has no competition they are ahead by a great deal, besides their youtube shorts which are definitely rivaled by tiktok.    Tldr: i dont understand why google dropped so much someone expllains";"223";"2024-02-29T18:09:05"

Do you think retail investors will start a hype around this?(i mean if openai traded publicly it would've gone to the moon already)   I have no idea about market analysis, but google's model is in the right direction and an improvement over chatgpt(what they have publicly available at least).";"0";"2023-12-07T07:06:02"

"Opinion: Google Leadership should be held responsible for a recent Gemini (prev Bard) mishap!";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1b6z8kx/opinion_google_leadership_should_be_held/";"In recent weeks, the tech community has been abuzz with discussions surrounding a significant mishap within Google Gemini (prev Bard), a division responsible for developing Gen AI.  Leadership in any organization carries with it a weighty responsibility ‚Äì a responsibility to uphold the integrity of the products and services offered, to safeguard the trust of consumers and stakeholders, and to steer the company towards its strategic objectives. When a leader falls short of these expectations, particularly in a manner that results in significant repercussions, it raises valid concerns about their suitability for the role.  Secondly, accountability is paramount in fostering a culture of excellence and accountability within an organization. When leaders are held to account for their actions, it sends a clear message that performance and integrity are non-negotiable. Failure to address lapses in leadership only serves to undermine morale and breed a culture of complacency, ultimately compromising the company‚Äôs ability to innovate and adapt in an ever-evolving landscape.  The severity of the goof-up and its impact on Google Gemini‚Äôs and overall Google‚Äôs reputation cannot be understated. In the fast-paced and fiercely competitive tech industry, even minor missteps can have far-reaching consequences, leading to loss of market share, erosion of consumer trust, and damage to brand equity. As such, swift and decisive action may be necessary to mitigate further harm and restore confidence.   This make strong case that the VP of Google Bard should be held responsible and should be removed from their position for this mishap, not only benefiting shareholders but also benefiting users of Google ecosystem.

"My AI momentum trading journey just started. Dumping $3k into an automated trading strategy guided by ChatGPT. Am I gonna make it";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1546utu/my_ai_momentum_trading_journey_just_started/";"As a major lurker, I‚Äôve seen quite a few of these ‚ÄúTrading journey‚Äù posts and I decided that I might as well jump in the fire with my very own take.  The weather is just about brewing with enough chaos that we might see a decent tailwind across AI stocks within the next few months. I intend to ride the hypecycle with a an automated AI strategy to capture as much upside value as possible.  **A few things that make me believe the AI hype cycle is just getting started:**  **The Fed‚Äôning**  * Government expenditure in relation to GDP will continue to increase This isn‚Äôt just a US phenomena, Nation states worldwide are increasing government expediture and reach.(Chipps act, various AI accessibility and regulatory acts). A good portion of this will trickle down into the market cap of bluechip co‚Äôs with big AI departments ready for big ol entreprise contracts.  **The upcoming major IOT adoption via regulatory enforcement**  * On this, I can single out an event that most people are sleeping on. The US food supply chain is about to undergo massive digital transformation with FSMA (The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act ). Think big data lakes and lots of machine learning having to be adopted at gunpoint in unseen rates all across the food supply chain.  **Upstream/Downstream innovation in private markets**  * AI tech has been commoditized, can be forked, API called, build on top of. Its pretty fluid and easy to access. As I type this, there‚Äôs tens of thousands of AI startups across all imaginable industries getting past product-market-fit hurdles, opening distribution channels, and ultimately expanding the AI global total addressable market . This early stage innovation will trickle down into public markets in record time. Wait a few months.  **My AI investment strategy - AI investing in AI (kinda ‚Äúquirky‚Äù huh?)**  To create my strategy I asked an AI tool ‚ÄúCan you create a momentum trading strategy focused on AI-focused stocks?‚Äù     &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/agv4ngxvjzcb1.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f4106905719facc3e078dbf048f78a490755b13  The AI-created strategy was interesting but I then made some tweaks based on the basket of AI stocks I wanted to include in this momentum trading approach. I removed IBM (as I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be a key beneficiary or leader in the AI race), and added PLTR (for defence/government AI exposure), TSM (for some semiconductor exposure) and META (this is a questionable one but the open source models that their research team have created our world-class and I don‚Äôt want to bet against Zuck).

"A Post-Earnings Review of Alphabet (GOOG)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/15bbp1h/a_postearnings_review_of_alphabet_goog/";"I'm a big fan of making things more visual rather than a whole lot of text, so here's a rundown of some key things from Alphabet's latest earnings.   # The Cloud Market Share  First up, cloud market share. Conveniently, Microsoft released numbers as well this week so we can lump Azure into this. Amazon has not yet given us an update on AWS, but we should get that next week. For now, here's a breakdown of how the Cloud market stacks up.   [AWS vs Azure vs Google Cloud](https://preview.redd.it/ujdyz4xqakeb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=77900a753697eb52ba6a328f5a219b3a9a10b1d4)  It should be noted that Microsoft does not break Azure out from a whole lot of other tools, I've assumed it's around two-thirds of ""Intelligent Cloud"" today. It could easily be +/- $5B from that $58.9B figure, but there's no confirmation of that.   Over time, Google Cloud and Azure are closing the gap on AWS. It's worth noting that the size of the pie is growing considerably, so AWS is still growing at a good pace, just Azure and Google Cloud have been growing a lot better recently.   &#x200B:  [AWS vs Google Cloud vs Azure over time](https://preview.redd.it/yqwy50b7bkeb1.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bf590948c039ac062ab41933ebb8a66bf8aa53a)  # YouTube vs Netflix  YouTube once again saw some decent advertising growth and it got me thinking... it's bigger than Netflix, right? Turns out it's pretty close on just advertising alone.   &#x200B:  [Netflix Streaming vs YouTube Ad Revenue](https://preview.redd.it/hr8y9fdfbkeb1.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&s=349f7763c9324eaf86297a208f4fbdde7fe50788)  Alphabet does not break out YouTube Premium subscription numbers, but once can be sure that the tally puts YouTube higher than Netflix streaming on a revenue basis. So, the next time Disney+ versus Max vs Netflix is brought up in a ""King of Streaming"" battle, just know that YouTube is sat quietly dominating in the background.   # Google Cloud's Profitable Year  Finally, Google Cloud is on track for a profitable year on an operating basis. It's not done that before, but the past two quarters have both been positive setting the stage for the company's first profitable year of cloud services.   &#x200B:  [Google Cloud operating income](https://preview.redd.it/gf92055ybkeb1.png?width=1316&format=png&auto=webp&s=febfa54c41fdbab7d96f035a52b3aa9c90c892c7)  # Suggestions / Requests?

Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings:  https://preview.redd.it/evtbd2dnkgec1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=47c5c6d9f58e6997aad5330dba32ff543e2c8541  Data Sources:  * SPY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/spy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Schwab](https://www.schwab.wallst.com/schwab/Prospect/research/etfs/schwabETF/index.asp?type=holdings&symbol=SPY)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/?guccounter=1)‚Äã‚Äã. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST)‚Äã * SFY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/sfy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Zacks.com](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/SFY/holding)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SFY/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST)  **Key Observations:**  * Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. * Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. * Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting.  It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation.  I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors:  1. **Expense Ratio**: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. 2. **Stock Selection Methodology**: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. 3. **Performance Trends**: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. 4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. 5. **Market Positioning**: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. 6. **Innovative Approach of SoFi**: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.  It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.  **What are your thoughts?**";"0";"2024-01-24T22:46:21"

A home buyer buying a median-priced home of roughly $400,000 today has to earn 50% more than they would have if they wanted to buy a median-priced home at the start of the pandemic, Redfin said recently.""  groceries are still as expensive as they were a year or two ago at the height of inflation and gas prices are rising once again after a slight cool off this past year. Yet they claim inflation is at 3.5% and umployment 3.7%.  I simply cannot believe these numbers. Am I missing something? or maybe certain portion of the population is being hit harder than others therefore not many question these numbers?  Edit: ok so I misspoke. Obviously if grocery prices stay even then there is no inflation. But still with things like gas, rent, housing prices, these things are things that should fluctuate. And they should be fluctuating to levels below pre pandemic levels. Yet that‚Äôs not the case. They continue to go up while wages are more or less stagnant if not slightly moving up. I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt have these bullshit methods of measuring the economy regardless the numbers do not reflect reality. You don‚Äôt have to be Einstein to feel this disconnect.   All in all.

"Booking Holdings stock analysis (Burry's 4th Largest Holding)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/19egc27/booking_holdings_stock_analysis_burrys_4th/";"Hi everyone, I hope you are all well. I want to share my thoughts on Booking as a company since I think Booking is interesting. If you're looking for a superficial analysis and don't like reading, look elsewhere. This isn't a superficial analysis, which is what is typically shared. I'll share why I think Booking might be differentiated from major competitors like Expedia and AirBnb. I'll also do an overview of the economics of the business, then write about the industry and competitors and estimate the intrinsic value. As I am sure all of you know, this is just my thoughts so please do your own research. I hope I provide some insights and I welcome an exchange of ideas.  # Company Overview:  Booking is an online travel agency (OTA). It is a parent company that holds a number of brands such as Booking, KAYAK, RentalCars, Priceline, Agoda and Opentable. As a whole, Booking provides reservation services for customers looking for accommodations, flights, rental cars, taxis, and restaurants. There is a lot interplay between these brands.  Booking categories their revenue as Agency, Merchant & Advertising & Other:  https://preview.redd.it/yoynm4bdvdec1.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bb8023f65586a7d9c50f2f233955952d7c0297d  Booking mainly generates revenue on commissions. Agency revenue is when Booking makes a reservation for a customer but does not facilitate payment: the supplier (hotels, airlines, etc) will follow up with the customer for payment. Merchant revenue is when Booking acts as a merchant: i.e. collect payment and remits payment to supplier. Bookings earns commission on both of these categories.  Merchant revenue is catching up and increasing its percentage as a proportion of total revenue and although this doesn't negatively impact Booking in regards to its position in the industry, it does negatively impact their margins.  [\*We can see that as the merchant category increases as a proportion of sales, operating margins are decreasing. Merchant revenue incurs additional expenses.](https://preview.redd.it/p23feffivdec1.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e8136b8494a66ee39983ff171530d87116dcf44)  ***Advertising & Other*** is revenue mainly earned by KAYAK for its meta-search platform: This platform lists hotel chains, flights, etc on its website. ***I am going to disregard this segment because Google Flights does the same thing, so I am estimating no growth here. Some people view Google as a competitor to Booking, and they do compete against KAYAK. However, Google benefits Booking's Agency and Merchant business since Google refers a lot of people to Bookings platforms. Google is ultimately an advertising business, they don't make reservations or facilitate payments.***  Marketing Expense as a % of Total revenue:  [\* Booking spends a lot on marketing and a lot of this spend is performance marketing on Google.](https://preview.redd.it/1728nthovdec1.png?width=1322&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0ef970697098c9761d214d20079ab3405fb987d)  Room nights booked *(in mill):*  [\*What I like about this data is that room nights booked \(one night booked = one room night\) in 2022 is higher than 2019, which was the record prior to COVID. Room nights have been increasing significantly in geographical areas \(like Asia-Pacific\) which has lower average daily rates compared to areas like Europe and the U.S. This also impacts their margins.](https://preview.redd.it/ihg86o3uvdec1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc22c62c0ece06231d4748f852126d83701feddc)  # Competitors  Bookings Mix of Room nights for hotels and alternative accommodation:  https://preview.redd.it/vg68jskyvdec1.png?width=1310&format=png&auto=webp&s=a06b7f3cb36a15454a04b2a152033cbfa63802f6  **AirBnb:**  The way I am thinking about this is 70% of Bookings accommodations are in hotels and motels and AirBnb mainly generate revenue from homes, holiday houses etc. This is only 30% of Bookings business, which they list as alternative. Although these two companies compete, I don't think it will affect Booking if Airbnb continues to grow since they don't specialise in hotel accommodations. I am curious to know your thoughts about this.  **Website Traffic:**  Expedia: 88.68% website traffic in the U.S.  Airbnb: 71.54% website traffic in the U.S  ***Booking: 10.86% website traffic in the U.S***  Most of Bookings website traffic is concentrated in Europe whereas Expedia and Airbnb is concentrated in the U.S. I believe this has other implications, especially when I compare Booking with Expedia that has a business model that is almost identical. Most of the hotel chains in the U.S are very popular: Marriott, Holiday Inn, Hilton, Hampton Inn and Hyatt to name a few. They have their own loyalty programs and big marketing and merchandising (cheap deals) campaigns and customers often seek these hotels out directly, although they are listed on Expedia as well. Since they are popular, they have bargaining power and can request lower commissions to be listed on an OTA. Since Expedia is heavily concentrated in the United States, this has an impact on their margins. Most of Bookings hotel suppliers are outside of the U.S. and these are often smaller, independent chains that rely more heavily on an OTA.  Expedia operating margins:  [\*I think this explains why Expedia's margins are a lot lower than Booking despite similar business models.](https://preview.redd.it/7p6324q6wdec1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ccb5168bcc2412b82dfc147b88b62296e5afdd8)  # Industry  OTA industry estimates suggest it will grow to over $1 trillion at the end of 2030. It is currently at $521 billion. Estimated growth is just over 10%.  # Intrinsic Value Estimate:  Historical data *(in mill)*:  https://preview.redd.it/vkjyvn6dwdec1.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=630988acdec18ed7e74f9a5717cfa2abc9b8b3d2  Growth rates:  https://preview.redd.it/mbwu64bfwdec1.png?width=1316&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a2184ffc68a8b2efb2c4d3e3b9fb88bb6193502  I have taken the current year FCF estimate (2023 FY results isn't out yet), and have estimated a growth rate of 8% in yrs 1-5 and 6% in yrs 6-10, discount rate of 10% and terminal value of 20. The growth rates are estimated because of the industry growth projections and Bookings position in the market. Also the 5-year previous growth rates for Booking was 8%, which was the lowest compared to my 1-3-7 and 9 years growth rates so I went with that. 8% is a lower growth rate than the industry growth projections and I wanted to be conservative, especially since the FCF in the current year is at record highs. I always like putting a lower growth rate in the latter half (6%) because it is a lot harder to estimate. The discount rate is high, however, my style has always been to make fewer bets for higher returns and I am happy being patient until those opportunities arrive. This gave me an intrinsic value of $4,296. I try and go a bit further to see if I can get a discount to intrinsic value.  &#x200B:  Margin of Safety Price ranges *(Discount to Intrinsic Value):*  [\*The calculator estimated these prices.](https://preview.redd.it/ksd1jc9jwdec1.png?width=1328&format=png&auto=webp&s=d935c0bf8ce556e96e33b1e06418c8e54817550d)  # Risk:  * Interest debt has been increasing over the past 10 years. * COVID really impacted the OTA industry and who knows if another similar crises will occur  \*\*\* I did not invest in this company, I just wanted to share my thoughts.  &#x200B:";"11";"2024-01-24T13:49:10"

(Advice Needed)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/13uf056/4_rental_properties_home_paid_off_no/";"**Hi team.**  **I've been investing the wrong way, and i need help.** So for the last 4 years, I've been buying real estate with no mortgages. All cash. This cash wasn't in an HYSA or MMF. Every dollar I've ever had was/is sitting in a Wells Fargo checking account. Currently, I have over $100,000 in this same Wells Fargo checking account (not even in their savings account). Now, I realize **how wrong I am** by having that amount of money sitting there.  **My current investments are the following:**  * 4 rental properties (Paid off, In Florida, generating $7,150/month.) * My home (Paid off). * 2 Stocks (NIO & Tesla). I invested in NIO 3 years ago and have an average cost basis of $48. It's worth $7 right now. Big, big loss. I've not sold any, and I'm not planning to (Pride?). The total investment on NIO is $120k, now worth around $20k. 3 months ago, I invested in Tesla, $30k, and that's the only stock that's up. My average cost basis in Tesla is $155/share, now worth around $180/share. * My car (It's paid off, although it's an old 2010 BMW worth around 4k lol. I might change it soon as my girlfriend complains that I'm constantly using her car lol.).  I have no debt, and my monthly expenses are around 2000 to 3000/month (Yearly property taxes/12, HOA fees of the condo I'm living in, and that's it. My girlfriend pays the rest (food and light, as I'm handling the HOA fees).  My monthly income varies, but for the last 4 years, it has always been over $10,000 (without counting the rental properties income).  I know that I've been a lucky person but also a workaholic, and I've achieved many positive things as a 30-year old, but I'm missing exposure to index funds in my portfolio. I forgot to mention that I'm an immigrant from Spain and a current U.S. Resident, so the culture of index funds, stock investment, money market funds, high-yield savings accounts, etc., wasn't taught to me. So I've always been doing what I knew best, working as much as possible and investing earnings in purchasing real estate.  So, I've heard the term ""mutual funds"" before, but I never really dug much into it. A few days ago, I started reading more about it and came across the terms ""HYSA and Money market funds"". After reading about it, I couldn't believe I've been saving my money terribly (I even called Fidelity to confirm that these HYSA and money market fund avg. returns exist).  So now, I plan to change how I manage my money.  **What I'm currently doing when I get paid:**  1. My paystub goes directly into my business Wells Fargo checking account. 2. I hold it there until there's a buying opportunity (Like a property). Remember, I don't save 10-15k for a down payment but 150-300k for a cash purchase.  **What I'm planning on doing AFTER investing a lump sum of 100k in an ETF index fund:**  1. My paystub goes directly into my business Wells Fargo checking account. 2. I keep 5k in my Wells Fargo business account and transfer the rest to my Fidelity account. 3. Once the money goes to Fidelity, 20% will go to an ETF index fund (I'd like suggestions on which one(s), maybe VOO?), and the other 80% into SPAXX (MMF). 4. Wait until the next buying opportunity (like a real estate opportunity) and pull from the MMF.  So, as a 30-year old, I'm already late to the party of the ETF index funds, and I'm plan on investing 100k in an ETF index fund to catch up with the years of not investing.  **My questions are:**  1. Is the approach of only having 5k in a basic Wells Fargo checking account and transferring everything else to a Fidelity MMF (80%) and an index fund(20%), savvy? 2. Which ETF(s) index fund should I invest in? I like conservative but also something that's quite heavy in tech, as I'm a big tech believer.  P.S. I'm not much interested in mutual funds because of the taxes of the fund selling and buying activity every year) or retirement accounts, as I'm not really looking forward to becoming a multi-millionaire by then, but earlier (hopefully)). I'm fine with paying taxes on dividends and when I sell the ETF index funds.  I appreciate your help, as i feel so lost with everything I'm reading about ETF index funds, MMF, high-yield savings accounts, etc.";"0";"2023-05-29T01:52:01"

Purchases, Sales and Dividends?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1bq3ljb/how_to_actually_calculate_cagr_incl_purchases/";"Hello,  I am currently calculating the CAGR over the years since I am shareholder of certain companies.  Since in many cases I have received dividends, purchased shares several times, sometimes even sold shares (but not the entire position)...I am getting a little bit confused on how to calculate the overall CAGR.  Let's assume we have the following variables:  * Start Value (SV) * End Value (EV) * Dividends received (D) * Purchases (P) * Sales (S)  I perform a very simple calculation, but I wonder what if these 2 options is more correct:  **Option A:**  CAGR = \[(EV + D + S) / (SV + P) \]\*\*(1 / t) -1  This assumes that I keep the dividends and sales as part of the End value.  **Option B**  CAGR =  \[(EV) / (SV + P - D - S) \]\*\*(1 / t) -1  This assumes that the Dividends and Sales reduce my ""net investment"" and are counted in the denominator.    In some cases, I have used the dividends to reinvest in the company, in some others not (I try to have the same principle for the complete portfolio). My goal is be able to measure the performance of all my companies. This becomes quite difficult because, in some cases, I have been a stakeholder for 10 years and I have an absolute profit of, for example, 250%. During those 10 years, I might have purchased shares in several occasions, instead of letting an initial purchase run. In other cases, I might have been shareholder for only 3 years, with a lower absolute profit but in a lower timeframe, and maybe with monthly contributions, etc. I think you get the idea.    Could you please give me your feedback as to whether my approach actually makes sense?    Thank you very much!    ";"2";"2024-03-28T19:59:43"

It really isn't complicated when you understand the logic behind. Quarterly earnings reports are profitable catalysts.  The most important lesson I've learned is that it's more important to manage your loss than chasing gains. To build wealth in the long run, it's the only thing that really matters.

Bill Gates has stated that AI could bring about a radical reshuffling in the tech industry, potentially threatening Google's market dominance, while Microsoft is making swift moves in the AI field. He expects that eventually, tech giants will integrate into applications similar to personal assistants, communicating with people and providing recommendations, replacing applications like Amazon, Siri, or Outlook. However, he points out that more work needs to be done to make AI tools like ChatGPT more accurate and objective.  In his past investments, Bill Gates has tended to invest in stable industries such as technology, healthcare, and energy.

Here is an image to show how lumber prices have fallen: [https://i.postimg.cc/J7gQN7zD/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/J7gQN7zD/image.png)  The units are USD per 1000 Board ft  Generally, when lumber prices fall, it's a sign of poor economic health. When looking at lumber companies, some have mentioned a decline in single-family starts as a reason for their decline in revenue. Companies like Boise Cascade have reported revenue declines of 34% YOY and companies like Weyerhauser reported a 71% decline in revenue YOY.  4) The Spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HMLqinyubF6y86myAXXM0TJpJOEOSJtC3wH5QOWa3qw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HMLqinyubF6y86myAXXM0TJpJOEOSJtC3wH5QOWa3qw/edit?usp=sharing)  In this spreadsheet, the first tab shows historic quarterly revenue and the %yoy increase or decrease. Here you can see that there are really only a few years where Home Depot reported a negative quarter YOY decline  To the right, I have TTM and FEPS. TTM stands for trailing 12 months which is the 4 most recent quarters of EPS added together. FEPS stands for Forward EPS which I was able to calculate using their 2023 EPS guidance. For this calculation, I multiplied 2022 EPS by 90% to represent the mid between the 7% to 13% decline in EPS for this year.  Historic EPS on the conservative side tends to be around 15 to 17 as found on MACRO Trends. Currently, we are around 17 PE using TTM EPS. Using FEPS, we are around 19 PE. Personally, I think we're a bit overpriced. Below that, I show the current dividend yield. In the Next tab over, I show their dividend history and how their dividend has grown over time. Home Depot is really well known for its amazing dividend growth.   I forecast different price points based on either PE multiples or technical supports and show what dividend yield will look like currently, 1 year out, and 2 years out assuming a 10% yearly dividend growth forecast.  Here are the technicals for HD to go along with the spreadsheet: [https://i.postimg.cc/mDK8gTcH/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/mDK8gTcH/image.png)  The blue line is an anchored VWAP from the all-time highs.  If you are interested in Home Depot stock, this may help you decide where fair value is and what your future dividend gains may look like. Also keep in mind if we see another housing boom with interest rate cuts, companies like Home Depot are likely to benefit yet again.   &#x200B:  Hope you all enjoyed\~";"17";"2023-05-21T03:19:50"

"The Rise of Data Centers: An Alternative to NVDA‚Äôs Dominance in the AI Market.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1525xgb/the_rise_of_data_centers_an_alternative_to_nvdas/";"Wall Street Awakens to New Opportunities Amidst Overvaluation Concerns and NVDA‚Äôs Vulnerabilities  In recent times, the technology landscape has been dominated by the impressive growth and innovation of companies like Nvidia (NVDA), which have become synonymous with artificial intelligence (AI) advancements. However, a new contender has emerged, challenging the notion that NVDA is the sole option for investors seeking exposure to the AI market. Data centers, once considered a supporting player, are now positioning themselves as formidable alternatives with the potential to not only rival but surpass the computing power of NVDA. This article explores the rise of data centers and the vulnerabilities of NVDA, shedding light on the implications they pose for investors amidst concerns of NVDA‚Äôs overvaluation on Wall Street.  The Alternative Powerhouses: Data centers have traditionally served as the backbone of cloud computing, storing vast amounts of information and providing processing capabilities to various industries. However, with the exponential growth of AI applications, data centers have evolved into powerhouses capable of supporting complex computational tasks and training neural networks. Unlike NVDA, which primarily focuses on semiconductors, data centers possess the infrastructure, scalability, and dedicated resources required to handle the intensive computing demands of AI algorithms. They are now ready to challenge NVDA‚Äôs dominance in terms of computing power and offer a more diverse investment opportunity in the semiconductor market.  Overvaluation Concerns and Market Perception: The buzz surrounding NVDA‚Äôs achievements has led to concerns of overvaluation as investors rush to invest in what was once considered the primary AI play. The stock‚Äôs valuation has skyrocketed, raising questions about its sustainability. However, market perceptions are shifting, driven by the emergence of data centers as a compelling alternative. Savvy investors are recognizing the potential benefits of diversifying their portfolios and exploring opportunities beyond NVDA, which could protect them from the risks associated with an overvalued stock.  The Shift in Market Dynamics: The financial landscape is dynamic and ever-evolving, with market sentiment and trends constantly shifting. The growing recognition of data centers as a powerful alternative to NVDA signals a potential turning point in the AI market. As the market becomes saturated with NVDA investments, the demand for alternative investment opportunities is expected to surge.  Blackstone‚Äôs Strategic Focus: Notably, Blackstone, a prominent player in the investment landscape, has already made a decisive move in favor of data centers. Recognizing the changing and highly competitive nature of the semiconductor sector, Blackstone has chosen to prioritize investments in data centers. This strategic shift underscores their confidence and foresight, as they find valuations more favorable and growth more prominent in the data center market.  Investing in Data Centers: A Viable Strategy? Given the increasing competitiveness of data centers, investors seeking exposure to the AI market may find it wise to explore this emerging sector. Data centers provide a robust and diversified approach, offering access to a range of companies harnessing AI capabilities. By investing in data centers, individuals can capitalize on the growing demand for AI-driven computing power while mitigating the risks associated with NVDA‚Äôs vulnerabilities and potential overvaluation.  Conclusion: The dominance of NVDA in the AI market is no longer assured, as data centers rise to prominence and challenge its position. While NVDA has undoubtedly been at the forefront of AI advancements, the emergence of data centers as a formidable alternative cannot be ignored. Investors are increasingly recognizing the value of diversifying their portfolios and exploring alternative opportunities beyond NVDA‚Äôs potential overvaluation. Wall Street is awakening to the vulnerabilities of NVDA and the immense potential of data centers, which are poised to reshape the investment landscape and provide a broader array of opportunities in the AI market. Blackstone‚Äôs strategic focus on data centers further solidifies their importance in the shifting technological landscape.";"1";"2023-07-17T17:59:44"

People say the Cybertruck is a joke, but I think those smooth-brains have a huge blind spot. Just back in March [Morgan Stanley shat on](https://insideevs.com/news/656606/morgan-stanley-cybertruck-low-volume-prediction/) the truck, predicting just 50k deliveries PER YEAR.  I'll keep it short but let's talk about it.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/67wh9l3twm7b1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=73dc7d836f45a4065af39ab19791014beec5211f  The Cybertruck has 1.5 million reservations already, and Google Trends data suggests that it could go as mainstream as the Model Y. When Elon tweeted about the Cybertruck in April, the internet broke with searches for it. And guess where these searches came from? Truck-loving areas. Places where all the dudes drive F150s and Silverados. They're flirting.  We all know how boomers in the auto industry like Ford and Chevy milk profits from gas-guzzling trucks to fund their garbage EV projects. But what if Musk and his Cybertruck come in across middle America like a wrecking ball? Cash cow slaughtered. Margins decimated.  I smell blood, and I think you do too.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/grulj39uwm7b1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b59bb746c62ca30fbdc6bdce2460f0e7026fcd9  Remember back in 2014, when everyone laughed at the idea of EVs? The US Energy Information Administration predicted them to have a tiny market share by 2040. Well, EVs hit 5% of the US market share last year, and the projection has been increased each year. Now, they're saying it'll be like 14% by 2040. They're worse at predictions than JPow and the fed are about inflation.  Even with that lowball number, Tesla‚Äôs got a path for 70%+ global EV market share. That‚Äôs like 8 million cars per year, up from 1.3m last year.  Now, some pencil-pushers are saying trucks will make up 69% of all vehicles in the US by 2040, but EV trucks will only grab a measly 10% of that. Here's what I say to them: üñï  These analysts might be scared of forecasting exponential EV growth, but I think it's about damn time they woke up and smelled the electric engine fires. The Cybertruck will be a nightmare for traditional automakers.  So this might be a good time to bump up your TSLA exposure. This is not financial advice, but those Cybertruck numbers should blow whiny analysts‚Äô expectations out of the water.  tl:dr: Cybertruck is gonna go mainstream, disrupting traditional automakers and sending EV growth to the moon. Hold onto your seats, apes. Watch those Cybertrucks fly off the shelves and print tendies with me through 2024.  Position: Long $TSLA.

I know that historically the best bargains are stocks which peg ratio are 1 or lower. However, I‚Äô ve noticed many of the big companies have peg closer to 2 or more than 2   examples: Microsoft: 2.61, Google: 1.72, Meta:1,58 , etc  So, in order for their peg to be 1 or lower all these stocks pe ratios should fall between 13-16 and to be honest I don‚Äôt see that happening any time soon(I even think these stocks will keep a P/E ratio of at least 25 or 30 the next 3-5 years )  So do you think a peg ratio between 1 and 2 would be a better reference than the peg of 1 or lower ? Most of the stock I‚Äôve reviewed seems to have pe ratios that double their growth rate If the stock projected growth rate is 10 it‚Äôs P/E ratio is close to  the 20s , if the expected growth is 15 the p/ e ratio is close to the 30s and so on. I think even the sp500 had a pe ratio of 20 when it delivered a 10% return last years(not sure about this one) But to me, it seems like that pe ratio would double the projected growth in most of the cases   Of course I might be totally wrong , so I appreciate any comments regarding this topic   Thank you so much for your time and help :)";"9";"2023-11-05T15:57:02"
"Will Big Tech Slow Down At All?

About a month or two ago I was fairly confident in a recession happening, but recently with new data coming out, it seems like there ain't gonna be a recession.   Strong labor market, inflation still sticky but it seems like a pause in June is certain which might mean there wont be any more rate hikes this year, and it seems like people who once thought a recession was coming in the 2nd half of the year and now saying either there ain't a recession coming or the odds of a recession are significantly lower than they use to be.  This is pure speculation but with the emergence of AI it feels like the magnificent 7 (MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, GOOG, META, NVDA, TSLA) is going to absolutely smash their next earnings calls in late July.   I'm really just looking for opinions on how and why big tech will see a decently sized correction in the near future because the way things look now, it's hard to fathom a big tech EVER slowing down.";"5";"2023-06-06T03:03:44"
"Apple becomes first U.S. company to reach $3 trillion market cap";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1493cw8/apple_becomes_first_us_company_to_reach_3/";"   * **Apple hit a market cap of $3 trillion briefly during trading on Monday.** * **The milestone is mostly symbolic but it represents investor recognition of Apple‚Äôs success over the past few years as the company has reported several record-breaking quarters of big growth in all of its product lines.** * **Apple‚Äôs cash flow also makes the stock a safe haven during times of market uncertainty.**  Apple briefly hit a market cap of $3 trillion during intraday trading on Monday, before dropping back under the mark shortly afterwards. Apple broke the barrier when its share price hit $182.86.  Apple rose 2.5% on Monday to close at $182.01, just missing closing the trading day at the $3 trillion mark.   The milestone is mostly symbolic but it shows investors remain bullish on Apple stock and its ability to grow. At a market value of $3 trillion, Apple tripled its valuation in under four years. And analysts see plenty of room to run.  Apple showed annual growth across all of its product categories in its fourth-quarter earnings, with revenue up 29% year-over-year. While the iPhone is still the biggest sales driver, Apple‚Äôs services business grew 25.6% year-over-year and delivered more than $18 billion in revenue during the quarter.   In December, for example, Morgan Stanley‚Äôs Katy Huberty raised the firm‚Äôs price target on Apple from $164 to $200, and maintained the equivalent of a buy rating, arguing that new products like virtual reality and augmented reality headsets aren‚Äôt yet baked into the share price.  Huberty also said she expects Apple‚Äôs App Store revenue to outperform Morgan Stanley‚Äôs forecasts for the quarter and for Apple to ship 83 million units during the December quarter, 3 million more than anticipated.  Apple sold 27 million pairs of its newest AirPods model over the holidays, driving 20% year-over-year growth for Apple‚Äôs wearables business during the quarter, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TFI Asset Management Limited said in a Monday note.  Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote on Sunday that the mark is a ‚Äúwatershed moment‚Äù but has more room to grow, especially since Ives values Apple‚Äôs services business at $1.5 trillion.  Investors also turned to Apple as a safe haven during recent market uncertainty, thanks to its strong balance sheet and prodigious cash flow, which it uses to invest in new products, stock buybacks and to return capital to shareholders through dividends.  Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to hit a $1 trillion market cap during intraday trading on Aug. 2, 2018. It hit a $2 trillion valuation just over two years later on Aug. 19, 2020.  Apple‚Äôs peers aren‚Äôt far behind. Microsoft is worth about $2.5 trillion, Amazon has about a $1.75 market cap and Google‚Äôs market valuation is just shy of $2 trillion.  Apple stock rose 34% in 2021.";"138";"2023-06-14T11:30:13"

So I'm going to try again, but this time I'm going to include excessive details: not to impress or boar, but to meet the required word count as so clearly stated in the automated response. Forgive me for using so many words to communicate such a simple request.  Background: I am a very small time investor who would like to understand more about the data I see on my trading account app, which is TDAmeritrade.  Recent Endeavor: upon perusing the various and plentiful investing apps in Google Play, as well as reading multiple reviews for each app that rated above 4 stars, I nearly blacked out from information overload. Too many choices, all with reviews ranging from ""better than sex"" to ""this app sucks, lies, loses my data"".  Bright idea: go to Reddit and find people who have plowed through the vast array of options, tried several, and have discovered there diamonds in the rough.  Big ask: I see a lot of information on my trading account, but am not able to digest what the data is or it's not telling me. What recent trends are developing and how they relate to the current data. Is there something happening with options trading that might offer hints about the stocks's future value?

"Airbnb's Q1 2024 Earnings Breakdown: Strong Organic Growth, Stable ADRs, and Strategic AI Integration";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1co1zd6/airbnbs_q1_2024_earnings_breakdown_strong_organic/";"Airbnb ($ABNB) recently hosted their Q1 2024 earnings call, revealing several critical insights into their strategic operations and financial health. Here‚Äôs a comprehensive breakdown of the key points discussed:  **Organic Growth**: Airbnb reported significant organic growth in app downloads, primarily driven by optimization efforts rather than paid advertising. This has led to improved conversion rates, outperforming their mobile website.  **Supply vs. Demand**: The platform has achieved a 70% net quality growth in its supply, aligning closely with the increase in nights booked. This alignment indicates a robust ability to match supply with rising demand.  **Average Daily Rate (ADR) Stability**: Despite various market conditions, Airbnb has managed to maintain stable ADRs, focusing on enhancing consumer value and experience.  **Marketing ROI**: Performance marketing channels have yielded high ROI, supported by ongoing testing and improvements in audience targeting and landing pages. Notably, the company remains resilient against changes such as the Digital Markets Act in Europe and alterations in Google search algorithms, thanks to its strong base of direct and unpaid traffic sources.  **Policy and Quality Control**: Changes in the extenuating circumstances policy were noted, along with a push towards quality control and host education. Airbnb is committed to elevating listing quality and host performance through targeted coaching.  **Expansion Initiatives**: The company is refreshing its product offerings, particularly in Asia, to enhance user experiences. Moreover, Airbnb is expanding its business scope beyond just accommodations, aiming to transform into a multi-vertical platform.  **Financial Adjustments**: The earnings call briefly mentioned financial adjustments including a one-off payment processing issue from the previous year. A shift in the timing of marketing expenditures will likely lead to an increase in marketing spend as a percentage of revenue in Q2.  **AI Integration**: Airbnb is keen on integrating AI technology into their services. Initially focusing on customer service improvements, the company plans to develop this into a full-fledged AI-powered concierge service.  **Analyst Q&A Session:** When being asked about the trade-off between removing low-quality listings and the potential impact on bookings, CEO Brian Chesky believes that the removal of low-quality listings hasn't impacted global bookings, as they weren't getting many bookings or were leading to customer service contacts. Furthermore, many hosts are coachable and can learn from feedback, and the company is seeing good hosts rewarded and expanding their business.  **Source:** [https://earnings-summary.streamlit.app/?c=reddit&t=ABNB](https://earnings-summary.streamlit.app/?c=reddit&t=ABNB)      What do you think about the future of Airbnb ?

"Disney Releases Official Vote Tallies from Shareholders Meeting: Peltz gets 30%, Rasulo 12%, Iger 94%, Michael Forman 88%, Lagomasino 63%:";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1c0a9h8/disney_releases_official_vote_tallies_from/";"Disney released the official vote counts from its 2024 meeting of shareholders held April 3 ‚Äî in which investors decisively defeated a campaign by activist investor Nelson Peltz to win two seats on its board.  According to the vote totals disclosed in an SEC filing Tuesday, nine of the 12 Disney-backed director candidates received more than 90% of the shares voted in their favor. The highest totals were received by Disney‚Äôs two newest directors, appointed last November ‚Äî Morgan Stanley executive chairman James Gorman (98%) and former Sky CEO Jeremy Darroch (96%) ‚Äî and former Cisco and Google exec Amy Chang (96%).  Disney CEO Bob Iger, as previously reported, received 94% of shares voted in favor of his reelection to the board.  The two Disney nominees with the lowest vote totals for their reelection were the two incumbent directors targeted by Peltz‚Äôs Trian Partners for removal ‚Äî Maria Elena Lagomasino (63%) and Michael Froman (88%) ‚Äî alongside Disney chairman Mark Parker (88%).  Peltz, head of hedge fund Trian, whose holdings include 30 million shares owned by ex-Marvel Entertainment chair Ike Perlmutter, garnered 31% of shares voted in his favor. Jay Rasulo, the former Disney CFO whom Trian also had nominated for a board seat, won 12% of votes cast in his favor.  Meanwhile, the three candidates nominated by another investment firm, Blackwells Capital, received only 2% of votes cast in their favor.  Although Peltz lost the proxy fight, he warned that he would take up the crusade again if Disney didn‚Äôt follow through on its pledges, including to move quickly on the CEO succession process to name a replacement for Iger (whose contract extension is up at the end of 2026). ‚ÄúWe will watch like we did last time,‚Äù Peltz said in an interview on CNBC on April 4. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a new set of promises, and I hope they keep them‚Ä¶ but if they don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll see me again.‚Äù  Disney shareholders of record were eligible to cast votes for up to 12 nominees. Per Disney‚Äôs bylaws, directors were elected by shareholders on a plurality basis. That means that the 12 director nominees receiving the greatest number of ‚Äúfor‚Äù votes cast were elected: ‚Äúwithhold‚Äù votes and any broker non-votes were not counted as votes cast.

"Portfollio allocation after move from edward jones";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/18rhcjj/portfollio_allocation_after_move_from_edward_jones/";"Hey guys, I wanted to get your opinion on something. Just for some background, I am 34/M Married (34F) no kids atm, household income is around 200K, only debt is house (about 70K on a 4% mortgage), but we do like to travel a lot. I contribute 15% to my jobs 457 plan biweekly through Lincoln, max out HSA, and have a separate retirement account from an inheritance years ago (sitting with Edward Jones atm). Target retirement date is 2042 - 2045, I get a pension and retiree insurance.  I recently made the decision to ditch my Edward Jones advisor and move everything over to Schwab. I had TDA as a for fun brokerage account, but then got moved to Schwab, that's why I use it. About 6 years ago I received an inheritance, I knew nothing about money and investing at the time, which is why I went to Edward Jones, but I cannot stand the fee's anymore. I have been educating myself the past few years and feel like I am ready to take the plunge to manage it myself.

"Top Tech stocks to consider: Unlocking high potential investments for Tech enthusiasts";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/13vmjy6/top_tech_stocks_to_consider_unlocking_high/";"## A combination of recent performance, future opportunities, and attractive valuations makes these stocks compelling right now.  Despite the recent sell-off of tech stocks, this sector is still a favourite among investors -- and for good reason. Technology companies are fun and exciting to learn about and follow, and many of their products are consumer-facing favourites of many investors.  In the current higher-interest-rate environment, the price paid for stocks matters more than it has in recent history. With that in mind, there are some stocks that are still trading for reasonable or cheap valuations that present attractive buying opportunities right now. Let's take a look at three of those stocks to see what makes them great buys.  ## PayPal  For many years, the story of **PayPal** **(PYPL** **1.43%)** was one of expansion, with revenue growth averaging around 17% each quarter. More recently, management decided to prioritize increasing the activity of its existing customers. The recent results show that this may have been a wise decision.  One example is how much more valuable each account has become to PayPal's bottom line. In the first quarter of 2023, active accounts remained relatively stable year over year, while transactions per active account have increased by 13%. This is proof that the focus on driving higher activity levels on existing accounts is paying off.  ## DigitalOcean  The leaders in cloud infrastructure are household names. **Amazon**¬†Web Services (AWS), **Alphabet**'s Google Cloud, and **Microsoft**'s Azure are the clear leaders in the space. However, smaller upstart **DigitalOcean** (**DOCN** **4.99%)** is not only holding its own, but it's also growing faster than its tech giant competitors.¬†  DigitalOcean caters to small and medium-sized businesses by offering affordable and transparent pricing as well as substantial customer support. This strategy has been paying off. In Q1 2023, DigitalOcean grew its revenue by 30% year over year, outpacing its competition. For comparison, AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure increased by 16%, 28%, and 27%, respectively.  DigitalOcean is also growing its largest customers even more rapidly than its revenue. Customers that spend more than $50 per month, called ""builders and scalers,"" increased by 43% year over year. These customers now represent 86% of total revenue. This is an important metric to keep an eye on as it is an indicator of how DigitalOcean is able to continue to serve its customers as they grow and scale.  The company has only been on the public markets for a few years, but it's currently trading for valuation multiples below its historical average and not far from its all-time lows.  ## Endava  **Endava** (**DAVA** **2.53%)** may not be a household name for investors, but it should be. This IT consulting company has been putting up impressive numbers despite the fact that its stock is down 34% year to date and down 70% from its late 2021 high.  Third-quarter 2023 results, which represent the quarter ending in March, were impressive with revenue and earnings per share increasing by 20% year over year. Endava is also consistently cash flow positive, and it generated a 10% free cash flow margin for the quarter.¬†  Endava has been growing its roster of large customers impressively. The number of clients spending more than 1 million British pounds ($1.24 million) in revenue reached 155 in Q3, an increase of 31% year over year. The overall customer base is also becoming more diversified. Endava's top-10 clients represented 33% of total revenue in Q3, down from 35% in the year-ago quarter.  The stock took a hit after earnings, mostly due to the fact that the company lowered its fiscal 2023 guidance. However, management thinks that slowing revenue from the private equity part of its customer base is a temporary pause due to the fallout relating to the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March.  Endava trades for three times sales and 25 times earnings, both of which are near all-time lows. With strong results even in the face of some important customers' short-term challenges, the current valuation is compelling for this quickly growing business.";"0";"2023-05-30T12:29:38"
"Fortinet Inc. ‚Äì Navigating Turbulent Waters with a Steady Hand";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/18hd4k6/fortinet_inc_navigating_turbulent_waters_with_a/";"&#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/vhetq7oq616c1.png?width=1545&format=png&auto=webp&s=58885d7a24a3f4459a23c64d8df3cc018d05244a  ## Key Takeaways:     * Since its last earnings report, Fortinet's stock has experienced a 33% decline, following results that fell short of analyst expectations and a forecast that was less optimistic than anticipated. * The company is transitioning towards Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) and secure operations. * Fortinet‚Äôs management expects billings growth to return to double digits by the second half of 2024.  https://preview.redd.it/3i0h44a6716c1.png?width=1773&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb61144ca461a4be0ff01f36372eca219d8a024b  ## Company Overview:  Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ: FTNT) is a global leader in broad, integrated, and automated cybersecurity solutions. It has established its prominence in the cybersecurity world by providing top-tier hardware and software services. The company‚Äôs commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction has solidified its position as a trusted partner in network security.  ## Fortinet‚Äôs Strategic Pivot Amidst Market Challenges  Fortinet Inc., a leader in cybersecurity solutions, encountered significant market volatility following its Q3 earnings report. The results highlighted challenges in execution and a downturn in the hardware market, attributed to post-COVID adjustments. This period marked a deviation from Fortinet‚Äôs traditionally robust performance, raising concerns among investors and industry analysts.  Despite these hurdles, Fortinet‚Äôs management team remains confident about the company‚Äôs long-term trajectory. They anticipate a resurgence in growth by the second half of 2024, driven by strategic shifts towards high-growth sectors like Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) and secure operations. This pivot reflects an adaptation to the changing demands of the cybersecurity landscape and a commitment to innovation.  A key aspect of Fortinet‚Äôs strategy is its partnership with Google, which expands its global Points of Presence (PoPs) and enhances its SASE offerings. This collaboration is crucial for Fortinet‚Äôs ambition to establish a stronger foothold in the SASE market, a segment that‚Äôs gaining increasing relevance in network security.  However, the company‚Äôs Q4 billing projections suggest a potential 5% decline, an indication of ongoing challenges in the market. This outlook is partly due to slower growth in the secure networking segment, which has been affected by prolonged sales cycles and cautious customer spending.  In response, Fortinet is intensifying its focus on sales efforts and investing in faster-growing segments like Secure Operations and Universal SASE. These initiatives are part of a broader strategy to diversify Fortinet‚Äôs revenue streams and reduce reliance on traditional hardware sales, which have faced headwinds in the current economic climate.  ## Recent Financials:  Fortinet‚Äôs financial performance in Q3 revealed a resilient stance amidst market challenges, with billings reaching $1.49 billion, a 6% increase year-over-year. This growth, albeit moderate, signals the company‚Äôs ability to maintain momentum in a complex market environment.  Looking ahead to Q4, Fortinet projects a slight decrease in billings, indicative of the broader industry‚Äôs normalization and specific challenges in the secure networking sector. Despite these headwinds, the company‚Äôs financial fundamentals remain strong, with projected operating margins exceeding 25%.

"Coca Cola ($KO) vs Pepsi ($PEP): Are Either Worth Buying Right Now?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/16kyp2p/coca_cola_ko_vs_pepsi_pep_are_either_worth_buying/";"Coke or Pepsi? These two companies have dominated the soft drinks industry for over a century. Coca Cola was founded in 1892 whereas Pepsi was incorporated 6 years later in 1898. Since then, both companies have competed for the top spot. A famous example of that competition is the Pepsi challenge, which Pepsi started in 1975. In fact, both companies attack each other so much in ads that [some argue they have shaped modern marketing](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/coke-vs-pepsi-rivalry-brand-marketing-metaverse/621711/). Even though Coke was the undisputed winner at first, [it's hard to say that today](https://awario.com/blog/coke-vs-pepsi-analysis/). Globally, Pepsi is the brand with a better social media exposure and better consumer sentiment. However, Coke has the bigger reach.  So, which company is the better investment choice? We all know that [Warren Buffett invested in Coke during the eighties](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052615/why-did-warren-buffett-invest-heavily-cocacola-ko-late-1980s.asp) and has made billions from his investment. To this day, Coke continues to be a big position for Buffett, currently standing at number 4, [making up almost 7% of his portfolio](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/berkshire-hathaway-inc#tabholdings_tab_link). Would you imitate Buffett and buy Coke? Or, would you choose Pepsi instead?  Historically, [Pepsi's total return has been higher than Coca Cola's](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%252CPEP%26interval%3DMAX%26metric%3DtotalReturn%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). That's been the case in the last 30 years, the last 10 years, the last 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, even year-to-date. Does this mean Pepsi is the better choice or was Coke just unlucky? Let's take a look at the latest earnings.  # Latest Earnings  At the end of July, [Coca Cola beat earnings estimates by 8.3%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3991061-coca-cola-non-gaap-eps-of-0_78-beats-0_06-revenue-of-12b-beats-250m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), but their revenue fell short of expectations despite growing 6.2% from the previous year. For the financial year, Coke expected revenue growth of 8 to 9% with earnings increasing 9 to 11%. They also expect a solid free cash flow of $9.5 billion compared to the $7.8 billion they had last year. Meanwhile, [Pepsi beat earnings estimates by 6.6%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3987312-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-2_09-beats-0_13-revenue-of-22_32b-beats-590m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and revenue estimates by 2.7% while showing a revenue increase of 10.3% as compared to last year. Pepsi also increased their guidance. They now expect a 10% growth in revenue and a 10% increase in core EPS, $0.15 cent above the consensus. Despite the good news, Pepsi's stock price did not move a lot and is actually down almost 5% since then.  # Valuation Metrics  Pepsi seems to have done better in their recent earnings than Coke, but what about the fundamentals and the valuation? Both companies are on the expensive side. [Coke has a slightly lower forward non-GAAP PE of 22](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), whereas [Pepsi stands at 24](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). However, Pepsi has better growth expectations, putting their PEG at 3 whereas Coke stands at 3.4. Coke has a higher Price-to-Sales of 5.6 compared to 2.7 for Pepsi, but then Pepsi has a higher book value of 13 compared to Coke's 9.6.  # Margins  The small difference in the valuation comes down to profitability and growth expectations. [Coke has higher net and free cash flow margins](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) than [Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) which is why the PS ratio is higher. It also seems that Coca Cola's margins are more stable than Pepsi's, at least in the last 5 years. To me, that's a big plus and I think this is a big part of why investors like Coca Cola. Stability is key and people pay a premium for that.  # Capital Structure  The capital structure of Pepsi and Coke is extremely similar in terms of market cap and debt. Both have a market cap of \~$250B and debts of \~$44B. The only difference here is that Coke ($15.7B) has double the cash of Pepsi ($6.45B).  However, Pepsi pays a higher interest than Coke with $600 million in net interest expenses versus Coke's $400 million. This puts Coke in a better light although honestly the difference is not that big. Their earnings before interest and taxes are almost identical at $12.6 billion and that covers the interest more than 20 times over so it's nothing to worry about. The financials are safe and secure.  Since that's the case, let's look at how Pepsi and Coke return value to shareholders. [Pepsi has been a lot more active with share repurchases](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DPEP%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) (and Buffett himself is a big fan of share repurchases!). You can see the steady trend here over the last 10 years. Pepsi's outstanding shares went down from 1.53 to 1.38 billion, a reduction of 10% or 1% every single year. In comparison, [Coke only bought back 2.2% of their shares](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Their share count was 4.42 billion in 2013 and is currently just 4.32 billion. In fact, we can see that their shares started going up over the last 5 years! Buying back shares is linked to a growth in share price and this could explain why Pepsi's stock price has been doing better than Coke.  # Dividends  Coke does have [a better dividend of 3.2%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Even though the 5-year growth rate is only 3.4%, Coca Cola has been increasing it every year since 1963! The payout ratio is a bit high at 70% and that's not great. However, Coke is financially stable. Their earnings are also meant to growth by around 10% so I think the dividend is safe and can keep growing. I don't see any issues although Coke should really focus more on share buybacks. One of the side benefits there is that the total dividend payments get reduced that way because there's just less shares to pay dividends on. This also allows the company to grow its dividend faster.  That's exactly what we see with Pepsi. [Pepsi has a lower dividend yield of 2.8%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), that's true. But, the growth rate is two times higher than Coke's at 6.9%. Pepsi has also increased dividends for 50 years so they have officially joined the American dividend kings list. Pepsi's payout ratio is relatively high at 65%, only 5% less than Coca Cola. However, I don't think the dividend or the growth rate is threatened as Pepsi is financially stable and is growing earnings at close to 10%.  At this point guys, I have to tell you that I did not expect Pepsi and Coca Cola to be this similar. I knew they would be close, but ***they are almost identical***. The main difference I see here is that Coca Cola has higher, more stable margins, whereas Pepsi is growing a bit faster, it's raising dividends more and is buying back more shares.  # Technical Analysis  Now, a quick technical analysis (I would add a screenshot, but you can't really do that here, sorry). I think Pepsi wins here by a large margin. You can see the steady bullish trend in Pepsi's price. They have dropped in the last 4 months, but the 100-day simple-moving average has been a good level of support for the stock price. It was retested in the first week of September and so far, Pepsi hasn't closed below it. I think that's a good sign. In comparison, Coke hasn't been doing too well. It's down 10% since May and is actually trading below the pre-COVID levels. Unlike Pepsi, there is no clear established bullish trend. Coca Cola's price peaked in April of 2022. Since then, we've see this wedge pattern form. To me, it looks Coca Cola's price is heading down for the 200-day simple average at $56. If it breaks it, then next stop is $54 dollars and so on.  # Price Targets  My personal valuation models put Coca Cola's fair price at somewhere between $61.5 and $68.4 with the exception of the Gordon Growth model which puts it at $50. Given the current price of $58, that's somewhere between a 6% and 18% potential upside. The [Wall Street consensus for the price of Coca Cola is $69.7 dollars](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and a 20.3% upside so they are clearly more optimistic than me. On the high side, they see $76 dollars, on the low side they see $60 dollars.  On the other hand, my models put Pepsi at somewhere between $127.7 and $196 dollars with The Gordon Growth model looking too optimistic at $222. That's a massive difference and the reason behind that is Pepsi's free cash flow. Even though Pepsi grows faster than Coca Cola, their free cash flow margin is half as big. That's why the discounted cash flow model ends up with such a low fair value for Pepsi, almost 30% below the fair price. Value investing is all about buying at a discount so I can't say that Pepsi is really trading at a good price right now. [Wall Street disagrees with me and puts a target price of $197.5 dollars on Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) with a 10% upside. On the low side, they see $156 dollars which is closer to my valuation, and on the high side they see $220 like the Gordon Growth model.  # Final Verdict  Now, what's the verdict here? To me, it looks like **the market is more optimistic about Pepsi than Coke**. This could be because of the higher growth rates, the earnings beat or simply because share buybacks add up. There is no question that Pepsi has a better momentum than Coke. While Pepsi looks like the better technical buy, it looks overvalued from a fundamental standpoint. **Coke looks like a much better buy in terms of valuation**. However, if I have to be honest, neither of these offers much in the way of margin of safety! I mean, both of these companies have a forward PE that resembles Google, but neither of these have the growth opportunities that Google has. I'm not saying that you should be comparing Google, Pepsi and Coca Cola because they are obviously extremely different. However, it is obvious that Coca Cola and Pepsi have a massive safety premium attached to them and that limits your potential profit. Plus, the current 2.8% or 3% dividend yield is nothing to be excited about. You could make a case for Pepsi given their dividend growth rate, but the price makes me think twice. I personally don't have any positions in either of these and I don't think I'll be buying soon unless they somehow drop by 20%.  That's my 2 cents. What do you think? Yay or nay on Coke / Pepsi? If so, why?  **TLDR: Pepsi looks better technically, Coke has a better valuation, but neither are really at a good price point for new entrants.**";"87";"2023-09-17T13:51:00"
"Total noob looking for a little help";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/15ii0sf/total_noob_looking_for_a_little_help/";"Hey all  So as the title states I'm a total newb to trading in general really. I do feel I have an alright understanding of how to evaluate a stock to some degree of success. However I'm having trouble using that evaluation to accurately predict how a stock is going to react. Obviously there is no exact science to this stuff but I just need to be a little more consistent.   So looking at two stocks this morning during pre-market. AMZN and DKNG, both beat fairly well on earnings. My initial thought process was okay both beat on earnings and both have gapped up a fair amount during extended hours trading, I would think they would continue the breakout maybe after a slight pullback at the open. However AMZN consolidated and eventually it gradually climbs to 143.63 then again gradually sells off throughout the day. Okay makes sense. DKNG however just dumps right off the open and continues to fall throughout the day quite sharply with a couple slight pullbacks, it falls all the way to about 30.38.  So I Googled around a bit trying to figure out why a stock that just posted good earnings would drop off like that. Most common answer I seemed to find was it's more about forward guidance than the actual current earnings. Okay that makes sense. So I went back and looked at both companies guidance for earnings next quarter on TradingView. Both are projected to post worse earnings next quarter than they just posted.   So based on that I would think both of them should take a bit of a dive no? This is where I'm confused. Why would they behave so differently? I'm still very much learning the ""market psychology"" so to speak and maybe that is where I'm going wrong? Genuinely trying to and interested in learning so any insight or advice anyone can offer would be much appreciated.  As a side note if there are any learning resources you found really helped you when starting out would you mind sharing? :)  Thanks in advance!";"7";"2023-08-05T03:19:49"

"A question about compound interest";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/14ovaxi/a_question_about_compound_interest/";"Hi guys. I am building a calculator in Excel to give a rough idea of how you would have done, based on past performance, if you invested a certain amount each month into the S&P 500 for the past 18 years and I wanted to know if I calculated it correctly?  So, I looked at the Google chart for the S&P, went back to July 2005 and checked how much it had risen from then to today. Turns out it is 272.59%.  I then divided that 272.59% by the 18 years that have passed. Which rounded down was 15.14%. I assume this as the average annualised return.  Then, I divided that 15.14% to give me a monthly return. It was 1.26% per month.  I also decided to pretend I invested ¬£100 each month, every month without fail, regardless of highs or lows. Pure DCA into the index fund every month. (I used GBP because it's my local currency, and I am not going to adjust for FX exchange rates just to keep it simple, so you can use USD, Yen or what ever)  To make my calculations after finding out those key figures, I then simply did the following:  I figured out how much those gains translated into each month by multiplying the total invested amount by the 1.26% figure we worked out earlier. Which for the first month, in the first year, looked like this: ¬£100 \* 1.26 = ¬£1.26.  Then, once the second month rolls around, I would add in my next bit of money I put in (¬£100) to the S&P 500 and added the monthly gains to the invested total. This gave me a total of ¬£201.26. (¬£100 initial investment in month 1, then month 2 I add another ¬£100 and count the ¬£1.26 gains: 100 + 100 + 1.26)  After this I repeated the cells all the way for the remaining 11 months in the first year and continued to repeat until I got to 18 full years total.  What it ended up looking like is this.  July 1st 2005:Invested = ¬£100.Gained = ¬£0.Total = ¬£100.  Today:Invested = ¬£21,700.Gained = ¬£90,776.56.Total = ¬£112,476.56  Sorry if I rambled or made it weird or confusing. I'm not amazing at explaining things.  I just want to know simply, looking at the S&P 500's past performance based on the start date I gave, up to today (02/07/2023) assuming I continually invested ¬£100 each and every month, would I have ended up with roughly ¬£112,476.56?  Thanks.  Edit\* Also, is this even how compound interest works?";"1";"2023-07-02T20:24:16"
"The Month Review: Technical Analysis & Trade Journal for May 2023";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/13xvoiv/the_month_review_technical_analysis_trade_journal/";"**OVERALL**:  Comparing the majors side-by-side show just how lopsided this 'rally' has been, with a clear breakout in QQQ, neutral consolidation in SPY, and clear bearish consolidation in IWM.  If IWM is playing the role of leading indicator as it often does, then this could tilt probabilities to the downside as we enter the summer...but...the similarities between how QQQ consolidated & SPY is currently consolidating could indicate one final push higher for the broader market, before the larger macro bearish pattern plays out.  Only time will tell, but what is equally clear is how much resistance is sitting on top of all three majors, due to the down-move they made over the course of 2022.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/qwyaoc20eh3b1.jpg?width=2392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=431a80cf2aa58dee11c391f5b4c09ce3af142370  **SPY**:  Price continued to grind higher over the course of May, and is currently struggling to break out of the February 2022 double top.  As a result, price remained in the mid-point of its upwards channel over the past month.  If price action follows what the QQQ did when it consolidated in a similar fashion, then the August 2022 double top (431.73) and the channel ceiling are major resistance before any true break out can occur.  Conversely, if this consolidation fails to move higher, then both upsloping channel floor TLs are major support.  &#x200B:  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/6o76j86nch3b1.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94345bc930ca3488712c9ac6bdf4de054985eeff  **QQQ**:  The consolidation which occurred throughout April definitely played out in a big way throughout all of May.  Price ripped out of the channel & through the August 2022 double top...and appears to be heading to a confluence of major resistance areas, namely the March 2022 gap fill at 361.10 to the March 2022 double top at 371.83.   That August 2022 double top (334.42) and upsloping TL from channel price broke out of are now the major resistance levels for tech.  Given how extended price is both from the October 2022 lows and since the May 2023 break out, as well as that confluence of resistance TLs, probabilities indicate at least consolidation...if not a bigger pullback to major support.  &#x200B:  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/dhxr8e75ch3b1.jpg?width=2395&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=73dffd82f0b22ddf1acbd061a296c055b273f2d0  **IWM**: While May saw decent swings up/down on a daily basis, overall the index continues to consolidate sideways in what is a clear bear flag off the down-move that occurred in March.  The upsloping TL of the parallel channel floor is the major resistance line: whereas the October 2022 double bottom is the major support line.  Before hitting those levels, price would need to break out of that bear flag, however, which puts immediate resistance & support at 179-180 & 171-170 respectively.

"Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/18s3rvu/magnificent_7_and_friends_contributed_75_of_sp/";"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing =  &#x200B:  The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023  [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9)  &#x200B:  The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions.  &#x200B:  It‚Äôs an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inflation battle, noted FactSet‚Äôs Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post.  &#x200B:  The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%.  &#x200B:  The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday‚Äôs close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%.  &#x200B:  Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%.  &#x200B:  Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said.  &#x200B:  That didn‚Äôt mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote.  &#x200B:  Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found.  &#x200B:  Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July.  &#x200B:  The strategy ‚Äúindicates the Fed‚Äôs measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,‚Äù Jakobsen said.  &#x200B:  The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks‚Äô bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group‚Äôs announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering.  &#x200B:  SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a ‚Äúmini‚Äù banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown.  &#x200B:  Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks ‚Äî Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78%  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%,  [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. AMZN, 0.16%,  Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%,  Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%,  Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%,  and Meta Platforms Inc.  META, 0.56%.  &#x200B:  See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024?  &#x200B:  Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind.  &#x200B:  The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.  &#x200B:  In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high:  &#x200B:  The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500‚Äôs weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted.  &#x200B:  Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500‚Äôs overall return, he wrote, with the company‚Äôs success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.";"9";"2023-12-27T16:52:27"
"The Month Review: Technical Snapshots & Trade Journal for July 2023";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/15jm94e/the_month_review_technical_snapshots_trade/";"**OVERALL**:  The incredible up-move we've seen may be showing signs of cracking: big reversal candles, gap-ups that quickly sell off to session lows, and the inability to float higher on very low trading volume.  If the bears are, in fact, taking back control then QQQ (and to a lesser degree SPY) is at an interesting inflection point: did price put in its first lower-high (similar to 2007 prior to the 2008 drop)...or...will price put in a briefly higher-high (similar to Bitcoin in 2021 prior to the 2022 drop)?  &#x200B:  **SPY**  Price has retraced 75% from the down-move put in during 2022: however, it did not make it back to the March 2022 pivot high before rolling over.  Major support is the upsloping TL of the channel price broke out of on 7/11/23 -- this level coincides with the failed breakout pivot high on June 15-16 and a gap window from that July day it finally did break out.  If it falls back within the channel, next support is around 430 which were pivot points on 8/16/22 and 6/26/23 respectively.  https://preview.redd.it/zfifvfkatggb1.jpg?width=2389&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=061989ecaa467e82982cb63d40c0b3cee9eda303  **QQQ**  Price has retraced almost completely from the down-move put in by the bear channel: however, it hit major resistance between the ATH pivot lows (Dec 2021) and 3/29/22 pivot high.  While this could be somewhat sloppy bullish consolidation, price just broke down through the upsloping TL it has been moving up along since June.  Now, price is sitting ontop of that major support level and has yet to break down through that level.  If this level breaks, there will be areas of minor support but the next major level is a return to around 350, what was once the upsloping channel ceiling TL which price broke out of on 5/18/23.  https://preview.redd.it/257t3f6jtggb1.jpg?width=2386&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a19656b57b4f987061bc90ade493c56b03046c16  **IWM**  Price continues to trade in the lower 50% of the down-move from Nov 2021 to Jun 2022, which suggests bearish consolidation on a longer time horizon and is interesting when juxtaposed with how bullish tech and even the SPY have moved.  If IWM is acting as a leading indicator here, then that would suggest a significant corrective move may be coming, especially for the biggest names such as the Magnificent 8.  Additionally, unlike the QQQ and SPY, IWM may have put in its 3rd slightly lower high from 8/16/22, 2/2/23, and 7/31/23 respectively.  The 202 - 198 area remains majors resistance, for both macro and micro pictures.  Looking at a shorter time horizon, price is sitting on major support from the upsloping TL it broke through on 7/12: if this level breaks, next support is around 188, then 179 before retesting 167.46 the current up-move's double bottom.  From a volume perspective, we've seen very light trading since early July, which has not caused price the float higher as steadily as it normally should, given how sideways price moved from mid-July to the end of the month.  https://preview.redd.it/f3e0wlpbuggb1.jpg?width=2386&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe087e0dcadc1f8a1c4f4fcd9b69ef2f96663827  &#x200B:  My swing trading account is curently 85% invested: it got as high as 98%, but closing positions & adding free cash reduced this percetnage to its current level.

Confluent's largest customer cohort continues to outperform  Data streaming is a technology rapidly growing in importance for businesses because consumers are increasingly demanding more live experiences from their digital products and services. **Confluent** **(****CFLT****)** is a leader in the industry, and some of the largest companies in the world are flocking to its platform.  https://preview.redd.it/1d47wfra1c1b1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=18d11ba93beb4cb1dc036b0c617549b74d19a8d2     Cloud computing allows businesses to operate online, and every interaction within their digital ecosystem creates data. The ability to use that information instantly is a game changer for the customer experience: a retailer, for example, can manage inventory in real time so products never go out of stock. And an online sports betting platform can offer live markets during a game because data streaming allows them to calculate odds, feed them to the users, and accept bets -- all within seconds.  The technology has implications for almost every industry, and International Data Corp. predicts 90% of the world's 1,000 largest companies will be using it by 2025.   In the first quarter of 2023, Confluent generated $174.3 million in revenue, up 38% year over year and well above its $168 million forecast. But there was an even more impressive figure: The number of businesses spending $1 million or more on Confluent's platform surged 53% -- more than three times faster than the company's customer base grew overall.     ## 2. DigitalOcean continues to outgrow its trillion-dollar competitors  **DigitalOcean** **(****DOCN** **-2.30%)** is a provider of cloud computing services that allow its customers to store data, host websites, and even develop software. It has one significant point of difference from its major competitors like **Amazon**¬†Web Services (AWS) and **Microsoft**¬†Azure: DigitalOcean targets small to medium-sized businesses with under 500 employees.  https://preview.redd.it/j5ogu8pz1c1b1.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9d5ea9ad7f757754226d5a6593c27779b6bc798   It's a lucrative segment of the cloud market because DigitalOcean can develop a relationship with businesses in their start-up phase and then reap the financial rewards when they begin to scale up. The company offers personalized service, cheap pricing, and a simple cloud platform with one-click deployment tools designed to suit its target customers. Other cloud providers are more focused on large enterprise customers, so they don't typically offer a competing value proposition for small businesses.¬†    As of Q1, DigitalOcean had 146,500 customers spending more than $50 per month. That includes 15,000 ""scalers,"" which are its top spenders, each contributing an average of $1,962 per month to DigitalOcean's revenue. Speaking of which, the company generated $165.1 million in revenue during the quarter, marking an increase of 30% year over year. That was a faster growth rate for the period than AWS¬†(16%), Microsoft Azure (27%), and **Alphabet**'s Google Cloud (28%) delivered!  &#x200B:  ## 3. Redfin stock has soared 149% in 2023  **Redfin**'s **(****RDFN** **-4.18%)** got off to a strong start in 2023, with the stock price up 149% so far this year. But it's still down 88% from its all-time high. The real estate technology company struggled over the last 18 months because the U.S. Federal Reserve embarked on the most aggressive campaign to hike interest rates in its history to fight soaring inflation. That's directly impacting demand for housing because consumers can't afford to borrow as much money, leading to a slowdown in Redfin's business.  https://preview.redd.it/f9q0wwkd2c1b1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=09c39ca2be669cca3c9cb6df40d69816a7367bc1  Redfin employs 1,876 lead agents covering 98% of the U.S. housing market (geographically), allowing the company to operate at a level of scale that smaller independent realtors can't match. As a result, it charges listing fees as low as 1%, undercutting the more common rate of 2.5% and creating a win-win for Redfin and its sellers.  The company is so popular that it represented 0.78% of the nearly 2 million houses sold in America during the first quarter of 2023. That might not sound like a big number, but there are 3 million registered agents across the country, so Redfin is punching well above its weight.  Due to the absence of direct buying, Redfin's revenue crashed 45% in Q1 compared to the same quarter last year (as expected). But Redfin is now a much leaner, healthier business, and it expects to deliver positive non-GAAP earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) this year. That's primarily why investors have sent Redfin stock soaring in 2023, and it might just be getting warmed up.";"0";"2023-05-22T09:24:34"
"An Open Letter to the CEO and directors of Cloudflare";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/159c3ez/an_open_letter_to_the_ceo_and_directors_of/";"   To Mr. Matthew Prince, and Directors of Cloudflare,  My name is Ming Wong, and I am the CEO of Zetalon Ltd., a company that has been a committed investor and free user of Cloudflare's services. I am penning this open letter to express my concerns and provide suggestions that, I believe, could contribute to the financial performance and longevity of Cloudflare.  Despite the company's remarkable growth in customer base and service offerings since its initial public offering in 2019, the financial reports from 2019 to the present indicate a continuous operation at a loss, with a reported loss of $190.1M in 2022. This persistent inability to turn a profit raises serious concerns about the company's long-term sustainability and its value creation for shareholders.  I understand that Cloudflare's strategy has been to build customer loyalty and support small websites to grow into large, paid websites. This is a commendable approach, and it has indeed resulted in a significant increase in Cloudflare's customer base. However, it is also clear that this strategy has not been successful in turning the company's impressive growth into profitability.  Cloudflare's growth and market presence are indeed impressive. The company boasts over 4 million customers, including 17% of Fortune 500 companies. It generated $431.06 million in revenue in 2020, a 5.08x increase since 2016. There are 7.59 million active websites using Cloudflare, and the company has 119,206 paying customers. These paying customers produced 88.84% of the revenue, indicating a significant reliance on a relatively small portion of the user base.  Despite this impressive market share, Cloudflare has fewer high-traffic websites compared to competitors like Akamai, Amazon CloudFront, and Fastly. This is a clear indication that the company's current strategy is not fully capitalizing on its potential.  Importantly, Cloudflare provides its services at a more affordable rate than many of its competitors, including BelugaCDN, Amazon Web Services, Stack Path, Microsoft Azure, and Google. This competitive pricing gives Cloudflare an edge in attracting customers, particularly small and medium enterprises looking for cost-effective solutions. While this strategy contributes to Cloudflare's expansive customer base, it further underlines the necessity of increasing revenue streams beyond just customer subscriptions.  However, the current financial performance poses potential risks to the shareholders. Continuous operation at a loss can diminish shareholder value over time, which could eventually lead to shareholder dissatisfaction and the potential for capital flight. Shareholder value should not be an afterthought: rather, it is a primary goal that aligns with the company's growth and success.  To address this and enhance profitability, I propose a strategic shift in Cloudflare's approach to its free services. Here are the specific changes I propose:  Limit Free Plan Features: Disallow features like Async JavaScript Loading with Rocket Loader and Multi-User Administrative Access and Read-only User Access in the free plan. Also, limit the number of free custom hostnames from 100 to 50. These changes will encourage multi-employee companies to upgrade to a paid plan.  Introduce Ads on the ""Checking your browser before accessing"" Page: By forcing this page to be shown on all free websites, it can serve as an effective platform for displaying ads, providing an additional revenue stream. This change could also serve as a stepping stone for Cloudflare to develop its own ad network, further diversifying its revenue streams.  Introduce a $20 per Year Plan: Replace the current free plan with a $20 per year plan. This nominal fee is affordable for most users and can generate significant revenue given Cloudflare's large user base.  Although these changes may entail risks such as potential customer dissatisfaction and a possible initial decrease in the user base, it is important to emphasize the long-term benefits. Implementing these changes could not only result in increased revenue but also lead to a diversified business model less reliant on customer subscriptions alone. This diversification could reduce risk in the long term and lead to a more robust, resilient business. Moreover, the profitability from these strategic shifts could significantly increase shareholder value over time, securing the company's longevity and growth prospects.  Here are some rough estimates:  If 25% of the 7.48 million free websites move to the $20 per year plan, that's 1.87 million websites. At $20 per website per year, the potential revenue increase would be $37.4 million per year.  Assuming 25% of websites stop using Cloudflare, the remaining free plan users would be 3.24 million websites. Assuming the average daily traffic of the websites is 100, that's 324 million page views per day. Over a year, that's approximately 118.26 billion page views. With a $3 CPM, the average CPM of Google Display Network ads, the potential ad revenue would be approximately $354.780 million per year.  So, the total potential revenue increase from both the $20 per year plan and the ads would be approximately $392.18 million per year. This revenue increase not only covers the $193.4 million loss reported in 2022 but also potentially results in a significant profit.  I understand and appreciate the reasoning behind Cloudflare's commitment to a free service, and I am cognizant of the factors that make it such an invaluable asset. I'd like to address each of these points:  Data: Cloudflare's ability to gather a wide array of data from its free service users, thereby enhancing protection for paid users, is indeed commendable. My proposition for limiting features on the free plan and the introduction of a $20 per year plan should not compromise this ability. A lower-tiered paid plan may even encourage more users to sign up, potentially offering a larger data set.  Customer Referrals: I recognize that customer referrals, particularly from satisfied users of the free service, play a pivotal role in attracting larger customers. I believe that a $20 per year plan would continue to offer tremendous value, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction and continuing to drive referrals.  Employee Referrals: I acknowledge the importance of the free plan in attracting potential employees. I propose that, with careful communication and strategic rollout, the changes will be accepted and will continue to attract top talent to Cloudflare.  QA: Offering new features to free customers for testing is indeed a unique and valuable approach. The changes I propose should not interfere with this. On the contrary, a more diverse range of customers due to a $20 plan may provide even more varied feedback and testing.  Bandwidth Chicken & Egg: I understand the role of free customers in achieving the scale necessary for competitive pricing and regional peering. By introducing a reasonably priced $20 per year plan, I believe that we can maintain, if not increase, the diversity and scale of our customer base.  Looking ahead, I believe that Cloudflare holds substantial growth opportunities, which, if tapped into strategically, could enhance long-term benefits for both the company and its shareholders. Specifically, I would like to highlight three potential areas of expansion:  Ad Networks: By introducing ads on the ""Checking your browser before accessing"" page, Cloudflare could diversify its revenue streams and lay the foundation for establishing its own ad network. Ad networks have been profitable ventures for many tech companies, and with Cloudflare's broad user base, there is significant potential for high returns.  Web Hosting Services: Cloudflare's existing infrastructure and network capacity make it an ideal candidate to offer web hosting services. This could attract a new customer segment that's looking for a one-stop-shop for their website needs, generating additional revenue while enhancing the company's value proposition.  Virtual Private Servers (VPS): The growing trend towards remote work and online businesses increases the demand for reliable and affordable VPS. By offering VPS services, Cloudflare could capitalize on this trend and further strengthen its market position.  By expanding into these areas, Cloudflare would not only diversify its offerings but also create synergies with its existing services. For instance, customers using Cloudflare's web hosting or VPS services could be more likely to use other Cloudflare services, creating a more integrated and stickier customer base.  Moreover, these new revenue streams could greatly enhance the long-term financial performance of the company. While the initial investment might be substantial, the potential for increased and diversified revenue could outweigh the costs in the long term, driving profitability, and thereby enhancing shareholder value.  While I believe that the changes, I propose carry significant potential for profit and growth, I am aware that they also present certain risks. Therefore, I find it essential to acknowledge and consider these risks in your decision-making process.  Customer Backlash: Changes to the free plan could lead to a backlash from current free users. However, it's important to note that even with these changes, Cloudflare's services are still very competitively priced. Therefore, despite changes to the free plan, Cloudflare will continue to provide excellent value for its users. Nevertheless, careful communication about these changes and potentially introducing transitional measures could help manage this risk effectively.  Competitive Dynamics: A change in Cloudflare's pricing structure could potentially alter competitive dynamics in the market, possibly inciting competitive responses from other CDN and cloud service providers.  Ad Network Viability: While the potential revenue from ads is significant, building an ad network also involves challenges. Besides the technical challenges, it may also take time to attract advertisers and achieve profitable scale.  Diversification Risks: While diversifying into web hosting services and VPS may seem attractive, it's important to consider that Cloudflare would be competing in a new market with its own competitive dynamics and established players. Moreover, the investment required to establish a presence in these markets could be substantial.  As with any strategic decisions, it's crucial to balance the potential rewards with the inherent risks. While the strategies I propose carry risks, I believe that with careful planning and execution, these risks can be effectively managed. Moreover, the potential long-term benefits in terms of revenue growth, profitability, and shareholder value are significant.  I am confident in Cloudflare's potential for growth and profitability. However, it is crucial that the management team takes decisive action to address the current profitability issues. The proposed strategies are not just about improving the financial performance of the company, but also about fulfilling the company's responsibilities to its shareholders.  Thank you for taking the time to consider my concerns and proposals. I firmly believe that these strategic shifts would significantly enhance Cloudflare's profitability and shareholder value. I urge the board to conduct a thorough review of the proposed strategies and consider implementing them for the long-term success of the company.  I look forward to your response and to seeing Cloudflare seize these growth opportunities, ensuring a prosperous future for all stakeholders.  Best regards,  Ming Wong  CEO, Zetalon Ltd.

"Alibaba Group: Navigating with ‚Äú1+6+N‚Äù into Digital Era";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/18id45h/alibaba_group_navigating_with_16n_into_digital_era/";"   https://preview.redd.it/1p62nwkzja6c1.png?width=1654&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d94fa024f7a9261c2f3fb268d80ecf370bad28c  ### Key Takeaways:  * Alibaba Group is focusing on AI-driven technology and a global commerce network as key priorities for the next decade. * Recent restructuring introduces a ‚Äú1+6+N‚Äù governance model, fostering agility and innovation. * Alibaba is intensively investing in core businesses, distinguishing them from non-core segments. * The company remains committed to shareholder returns, with significant share repurchases + dividend payment in fiscal year 2024. * Alibaba‚Äôs cloud computing platform is the third largest globally, emphasizing AI and cloud convergence.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/bvl0d1lxja6c1.png?width=1772&format=png&auto=webp&s=f84060657a39d2381daa8efec8dd562ed5145d58  ### Company Overview:  Founded in 1999, Alibaba Group Holding Limited began with a mission to empower small businesses through digital innovation. Today, it stands as a global leader in e-commerce, cloud computing, digital media, and other technological innovations. The company‚Äôs foundation lies in addressing customer needs and fostering an ecosystem where all participants create and share value. Known for its massive online marketplaces, Alibaba has expanded its reach into various sectors, positioning itself as a key player in the digital economy.  ### Alibaba‚Äôs Strategic Shift: Embracing AI and Global Commerce  Alibaba Group, under the leadership of CEO Yongming ‚ÄòEddie‚Äô Wu, is at a pivotal juncture, redefining its strategic direction to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving digital landscape. The company‚Äôs recent earnings call highlighted significant shifts in its operational and strategic focus, emphasizing the importance of AI-driven technology and a global commerce network as its primary growth drivers for the next decade.  The company is undergoing a transformation, focusing on establishing a nimble and fast decision-making governance structure. This shift is crucial as Alibaba contends with rapidly developing technologies and changing market expectations. The corporate governance reforms initiated this year aim to enhance the company‚Äôs entrepreneurial mindset and improve its decision-making systems.  Alibaba is also conducting a strategic review of its existing businesses, distinguishing between core and non-core segments. After 24 years, Alibaba is evolving from a single company into a new governance model of ‚Äú1+6+N‚Äù in which major business groups and various companies have independent operations.  ‚Äú1‚Äù represents Alibaba Group‚Äôs holding company, ‚Äú6‚Äù refers to six major business groups ‚Äì Cloud Intelligence Group, Taobao and Tmall Group, Local Services Group, Alibaba International Digital Commerce (AIDC) Group, Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited, and Digital Media and Entertainment Group, and ‚ÄúN‚Äù refers to various businesses such as Alibaba Health, Sun Art Retail, and Freshippo.  The company is intensively investing in its core businesses, pursuing R&D, and enhancing user experiences to ensure long-term vitality and competitiveness. This approach is expected to maximize synergy across business groups, striking a balance between independence and cooperation.  In terms of financial performance, Alibaba remains committed to delivering shareholder value. During fiscal year 2023, the company repurchased approximately US$10.9 billion of its shares, representing a significant portion of its free cash flow. This move underscores Alibaba‚Äôs confidence in its financial health and long-term prospects.  Moreover, Alibaba‚Äôs cloud computing platform, the third largest globally, is set to play a pivotal role in the company‚Äôs future. The convergence of AI and cloud computing is identified as a key impetus for future development, signaling Alibaba‚Äôs commitment to technological innovation and transformation.  In summary, Alibaba Group is strategically positioning itself to navigate the challenges and opportunities of the new digital era. By focusing on AI-driven technologies, global commerce, and a reinvigorated corporate structure, the company is poised to unlock new growth avenues and reinforce its market leadership.  ### Recent Financials:  Alibaba‚Äôs diverse business model, spanning from China commerce to international commerce and digital media, has enabled it to maintain financial stability. Despite global economic fluctuations, Alibaba generated substantial free cash flow, evidencing its robust financial health. The company‚Äôs strategic investments in new technologies and talent, coupled with a significant share repurchase program, reflect its commitment to long-term value creation and shareholder returns.  Alibaba‚Äôs financial performance over the past few years has been noteworthy. The company has experienced a 5-year CAGR free cash flow growth of 12% and a FCF margin of 22%. Additionally, its 5-year CAGR revenue growth over the same period was about 28%. Despite the market‚Äôs negative sentiment, Alibaba‚Äôs net debt stands at an impressive -$51.48 billion, with a market capitalization of $183 billion. The fiscal year 2023 has shown improvement across all business segments, with notable growth in international commerce and steady performance in local services, digital media, and cloud services. Alibaba‚Äôs ability to maintain profitability and generate substantial cash flow, despite challenging market conditions, and political concerns speaks to its financial resilience and operational efficiency.  ### Financial Bullet Points:  * Revenue: RMB 224.79 billion (2023-09-30), **up** 8.5% YoY. * Gross Profit: RMB 85.13 billion (2023-09-30), 12.06% **increase** YoY. * Net Income: RMB 27.85 billion (2023-09-30), **significantly up** from a previous year‚Äôs loss. * Gross Margin: 37.87% (2023-09-30), an **increase** from 36.67% the previous year. * FCF Margin: 21.90% (2023-09-30), an **increase** from 16.89% the previous year.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/hhoymiovja6c1.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=0528b5afd12d68f769ef77bbe4758222378b7456  ### Business Model & Competitors Analysis:  Alibaba‚Äôs business model is diverse, spanning e-commerce, cloud computing, digital media, and entertainment. Its major e-commerce platforms, Taobao and Tmall, are the cornerstone of its success, offering a wide range of products and services. Alibaba Cloud, the digital backbone of the company, provides cloud services and solutions, supporting businesses globally.  In terms of competition, Alibaba faces challenges from domestic players like Tencent and JD.com, as well as international giants like Amazon and Google, especially in cloud computing and digital services.  ### SWOT Analysis:  * **Strengths**: Strong market presence, diverse business portfolio, robust cloud computing services. * **Weaknesses**: Regulatory and political challenges, dependence on the Chinese market. * **Opportunities**: Expansion in international markets, advancements in AI and technology. * **Threats**: Intense competition, geopolitical tensions, and changing market dynamics.  ### Investment Outlook:  Alibaba‚Äôs current market valuation appears significantly undervalued, especially when considering its robust financials and market position. Analysis using discounted cash flow models suggests even with very low assumptions, that Alibaba‚Äôs fair value is more than double its current stock price. This undervaluation presents a substantial opportunity for investors. The company‚Äôs financial health, combined with its potential for growth and recovery, makes it a compelling choice for those looking to invest in a company with a strong foundation and promising future prospects. Despite the recent political challenges and market volatility, Alibaba‚Äôs fundamentals and strategic positioning hint at a significant upside potential in the coming years.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/rmo8zycuja6c1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f9b835225efb9ff88b56622b163b5f8aca439b6  Loop Capital holds a perspective that Alibaba‚Äôs valuation does not factor in its international commerce, local services, logistics, digital media, and Ant Group segments. Despite this, they have set a price target of $115 for Alibaba, indicating a potential 65% upside. They also observe that the core e-commerce business of Alibaba is currently valued at 7 times earnings, which they consider to be a subdued valuation. Under more typical market conditions, Loop Capital suggests that a more appropriate multiple for this segment would be around 15 times earnings.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/00itg8asja6c1.jpg?width=692&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4b8aa0cace10e185be1d460452f8a071d6ed1ea  ### Concluding Remarks:  Alibaba Group is at a transformative phase, strategically positioning itself for the future. With a strong financial foundation, a focus on AI and technology, and a commitment to core business segments, Alibaba is well-equipped to navigate the challenges and seize the opportunities of the digital era.

"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 18th, 2023";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/18j7o7p/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/";"Good Friday afternoon to all of you here on r/StockMarket! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 18th, 2023.  # **Dow, Nasdaq close higher Friday, extending rally to a seventh winning week: Live updates- [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)** ***** > The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher Friday after a whipsaw session, where it marked a fresh intraday record, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 closed at a record high, as Wall Street pushed both major indexes to their seventh-straight winning week. ***** > The Dow closed up 56 points, or 0.2%, at 37,305.16. The S&P 500 slipped 36 points, or 0.01%, to 4,719.19 while the Nasdaq Composite closed up 52 points, or 0.4% at 14,813.92. The Nasdaq-100 broke above 16,573.34, a record closing high reached in November 2021. ***** > Shares of Costco ended the day up 4.5% after hitting an all-time high during the session. The retailer surpassed Wall Street‚Äôs estimates for quarterly results and issued a dividend of $15 per share. ***** > Both the 30-stock Dow and the tech-heavy Nasdaq notched their seventh straight positive week. As of Friday, the Dow is higher on the month by 3.7%. The S&P 500 is up by 3.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite has climbed 4.2% so far in December. The S&P 500‚Ä≤s close brought the index just shy of its seventh straight weekly gain, which would have marked its longest winning streak since 2017. The S&P 500 could still soon join the Dow with its own all-time high, however, as the broad market index is less than 2% away from a record close set in January 2022. ***** > Wall Street rallied this week after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday admitted that its efforts to tamp down inflation are taking hold, and indicated three interest rate cuts are coming in 2024, buoying investor sentiment. The November retail sales data that came in stronger than expected on Thursday, following this week‚Äôs cooler inflation readings, added to hopes the Federal Reserve could navigate a soft landing. ***** > That said, New York Fed President John Williams pushed back on the euphoria around the central bank easing rates next year. ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt really talking about rate cuts right now,‚Äù Williams told CNBC‚Äôs Steve Liesman in an interview on Friday. ***** > ‚ÄúStocks got a major sentiment boost from Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting, but that immediate effect was bound to wear off,‚Äù said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E-Trade. ‚ÄúThe market doesn‚Äôt go up every day, no matter how strong a trend is. Pullbacks and pauses are inevitable, regardless of how big they are or how long they last.‚Äù  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/1CKxw09.png))**  # **S&P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ctidu4p.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lB7yYHS.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/bpETcIX.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jU3k5JJ.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/HVT2srn.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/9iQ7H4n.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/uGD4hxG.png))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bmO9QCX.png))**  # **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PjXHYwd.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/58K9Yx1.png))**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/E0mZekj.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/70UpDSy.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FekAXMN.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ufkLgfJ.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/elt4ibY.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/8i1w5dx.png))**  *****  > # Magnificent Seven Market Cap Round Trip  > At the start of 2022, the seven largest S&P 500 stocks by market cap (which have begun to colloquially be called the Magnificent Seven) possessed a combined market cap of $11.78 trillion. However, severe losses throughout 2022 meant that by the end of the year these stocks were down 47.7% on average. In terms of the combined market cap, that dropped the total down to just $6.9 trillion. In 2023, those same seven stocks have averaged a gain of 106.6%. While not all of these stocks have fully recovered‚Äîfor example, Telsa (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Meta (META) all have lower market caps than at the start of 2022‚Äîthe strong performance this year on the whole has meant the combined market cap has made a round trip. Now back to square one, what‚Äôs next?  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121523-Mag-Seve.png))**  *****  > # All About Dow New Highs  > In the face of many worries, stocks have put together a historic year in ‚Äô23. To top things off, the Dow just hit a fresh new all-time high, its first new high since January 4, 2022.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/blog-1-2.png))**  > **New Highs Happen More Than You Think** Interestingly, this marked the 11th consecutive year that the Dow made a new high, the second longest streak ever! Of course, the previous two calendar years have had a total of only four new highs, but it still counts.  > Since 1900 there have been nearly 1,400 new highs, which actually comes out to 4.5% of all days since 1900 closing at a new all-time high. That is probably much more than most people expect.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/blog-2-2.png))**  > **Stocks Lead the Economy** > Since markets are forward looking, stocks tend to lead the economy. This can work on the way up and way down, so for us new highs right now is suggesting the economy is on firm footing heading into ‚Äô24 and a stronger economy (with no recession) could be the play next year.  > Sure, there are always some examples of that ‚Äòfinal new high‚Äô right before trouble (1929, 2000, and 2007), but looking back at history, new highs rarely suggest impending doom right around the corner.  > Since World War II, there were 227 months that saw at least one new high for the Dow. A recession started within a year of one of those months only 26 times, or 11.5% of the time. Compare this with the economy being in a recession 13.9% of the time since WWII and new highs could be a subtle positive sign for the economy next year.  > The last new high for the Dow was nearly two years ago, so what happens after the Dow goes a long time without new high? I found 12 times since WWII it went at least a full year without a new high and then made one, and only twice did the economy fall into a recession within a year of that new high.  > What stood out about those two times was both saw Middle East turmoil and a spike in crude oil, likely contributing to the recession. Given the US now produces more oil than anyone, does it makes sense to bet against history and treat this new high as an exception? Here‚Äôs a tweet I sent on this idea.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/blog-3-2.png))**  > **Now What?** > Plain and simple, new highs aren‚Äôt bearish events. In fact, you tend to see new highs take place during bull markets, with more advances potentially ahead. We‚Äôve been calling this a new bull market for over a year now. As far back as last November we said the lows were in and there would be no recession in 2023 (with many arguing with us the whole way up).  > In fact, here‚Äôs an interview I did six months ago with Scott Wapner on CNBC‚Äôs Closing Bell. When he asked me what my biggest worry was, I said it was that too many people were bearish and weren‚Äôt embracing this bull market.  > So what do new highs mean by the numbers? By itself, a new high doesn‚Äôt appear to signal any warnings. In fact, things look about average after new highs. There are the nearly 1,400 new highs since 1900 and a year later the Dow was up 7.8% on average and higher 70.2% of the time. Compare this with the average year since 1900, which was up 7.4% on average and higher 65% of the time.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/blog-4-3.png))**  > But the Dow‚Äôs long break without a new high until now improves the outlook historically. Looking at those 12 times (since WWII) the Dow went at least one year without a new high and then finally made one, ol‚Äô Papa Dow was higher a year later 10 times and up an average of 14.1% with a very solid median return of 16.4%.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/blog-5.jpg))**  *****  > # Wealth Effect Picks Up Into Christmas  > With just two weekends left to shop before Christmas, US consumers have to be feeling a little more flush than they were just a couple months ago. Back in October, the stock market was in a 10%+ drawdown and interest rates looked like they might never stop going up. Less than two months later, though, the S&P 500 Total Return index is suddenly trading at all-time highs as Treasury yields have plummeted.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/totalreturn1215.png))**  > Maybe just as important for that ""wealth effect"" feeling is the huge drop in gas prices that we've seen since late September. Back on September 17th, AAA's national average gas price reading (the cost of a gallon of regular unleaded) hit a 52-week high of $3.88. In the three months since then, there has hardly been a day when gas prices haven't gone down, and just yesterday the price/gallon ticked down to $3.087. That drop took gas prices below the low of $3.096 seen last December 22nd to their lowest levels in more than two and a half years dating back to 6/24/21.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/gallongas.png))**  > With the stock market at new highs again and gas prices suddenly approaching a ""2-handle,"" Santa may have a little more room in his gift sack this year!  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/santgabag.png))**  *****  > # FAANG+ Leaving Newcomers in the Dust  > Both the NYSE FAANG+ Index and Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) have put in place fresh 52-week highs in the past couple of days, however, zooming out, those fresh highs are on different planets. The NYSE FAANG+ index‚Äîcomprised of many mega cap Tech stocks‚Äîis not only at a 52-week high, but it's trading at record highs. Since the pre-COVID market high in February 2020, the FANG+ group is now up 120.1%. As for the IPO ETF, this week's 52-week high only leaves the group at the highest levels since April 2022. Contrary to the all-time high for FAANG+, IPO is still down 51.7% from its February 2021 high and is up a meager 4.7% since pre-COVID. As you can see below, these two traded closely inline with each other in the early days of the post-COVID rally, but FANG+ has left IPO in the dust since the start of 2022.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121523-FANG-vs-IPO.png))**  *****  > # Bulls Take the Majority  > More and more equity indices are hitting fresh record highs with the S&P 500 within 1.5% of doing the same. Understandably on these moves, investor sentiment has gotten a further boost. Per the latest AAII Investor Sentiment Survey, 51.3% of investors reported as bullish this week. And keep in mind, due to the timing of the survey, that would not have fully captured any investor response to yesterday's FOMC. That is the highest and first reading above 50% since July 20th of this year when bulls were only 0.1 percentage points higher. Outside of that week, it would be the highest bullish sentiment reading since April 2022.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-AAII-1.png))**  > Given the new high in bulls, bears have been nowhere to be found. A meager 19.3% of respondents reported as bearish this week. That surpasses the recent low of 19.6% from just two weeks ago for the lowest amount since the first week of January 2018 when only 15.56% of responses were bearish.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-AAII-2.png))**  > The overwhelmingly bullish sentiment can also be observed through the bull-bear spread. Currently, the share of bulls outnumber bears by 32 percentage points. That is the widest margin in favor of bulls since April 2021. Looked at another way, that is 2.1 standard deviations above the historical average of the spread meaning sentiment is extremely extended..  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-AAII-3.png))**  > The cheery sentiment on the part of investors certainly means there is a warm and fuzzy feeling during this holiday season, but we would note that sentiment is historically a contrarian indicator. In other words, opposite to what investors are feeling, extremely bullish sentiment readings have historically been followed by more lackluster returns.  *****  > # Claims Cooling Down  > Economic data this morning broadly came in healthier than expected, including weekly jobless claims. Initial claims were expected to go unchanged at 220K. While that previous week's reading was revised up to 221K, this week's print fell all the way down to 202K. That is the lowest reading on jobless claims since the week of October 14th and September 16th before that. In all, that makes for one of the lowest readings on claims since January of last year.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-Claims-1.png))**  > Before seasonal adjustment, claims are largely following the usual seasonal pattern having been trending higher since the early fall. Currently at 248.3K, unadjusted claims are running at the lowest level for the comparable week of the year since 1969.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-Claims-2.png))**  > Continuing claims have gotten much more elevated than initial claims over the past few months. Currently totaling 1.876 million, continuing claims have risen meaningfully from the low of 1.658 million put in place just three months ago. However, the consistent pace of increases over that span (every week from September 16th through the first week of November saw a week over week increase) has slowed, having been more choppy in the past month. In fact, at 1.876 million, the current reading is still almost 50K below the recent high of 1.925 million set in mid-November.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-Claims-3.png))**  *****  > # Moderating Inflation & Final Fed Meeting Clear Path for late-December Surge  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ef864c3f84106395bbfd2b61bd54035c/858694959f22126f-96/s500x750/a55689a0153a6b79ad518fa46fcda7cf02675b2f.jpg))**  > This week‚Äôs CPI and PPI releases showed the moderating trend of inflation continues. Prices are still rising just at a slower pace and the rate of change could finally fall back before the Fed‚Äôs target of 2% next year. In response to and in anticipation of lower interest rates, the market has enjoyed above average gains in December.  > As of the close on December 12, DJIA was up 1.74%, S&P 500 +1.66%, NASDAQ +2.16% and Russell 2000 up an impressive 3.99% (right side vertical axis of chart above). The market did experience some typical early December weakness this year after bucking the trend of weakness on the first trading day. Even though the market has already enjoyed above average gains this month, we still anticipate more to come with the potential for a new all-time closing high from DJIA before year end.  *****  > # Inflation Still Moving in the Right Direction  > This morning‚Äôs Consumer Price Index for November was mostly in line with expectations (although the headline reading was slightly higher than expected), and the lack of any meaningful surprises has allowed the market to continue with what has lately been the path of least resistance, which has been higher. The report also showed that the most rapid leg of disinflation is most likely behind us, and while that could lead some to believe that the road ahead will be a slog, that isn‚Äôt necessarily the case.  > For starters, the focus of monthly inflation reports lately has been in Core CPI (ex-food and energy). After peaking at 6.6% in June 2022, the November year/year reading came in at 4.0% for the second month in a row.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-Core-CPI.png))**  > The chart below shows the historical 12-month rate of change in the y/y core CPI. Over the last 12 months, that rate of increase has declined by two full percentage points, and outside of the prior two months, that is one of the sharpest declines since the early 1980s. In other words, the 12-month rate of change is still declining, but the pace of decline is slowing.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-Core-CPI-One-Year-Change.png))**  > November‚Äôs streak also ended what has been a monumental streak of monthly declines in the y/y core CPI reading. At seven months in October, it was the second longest streak on record, trailing only the ten-month streak of declines ending in December 1975.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-Core-CPI-Declines-Streaks.png))**  > Understandably, the end of the streak of declines along with the slowing rate of decline in the y/y core CPI reading could lead one to think that inflation levels are plateauing at a higher level. However, a look at the trend of monthly prints in core CPI shows a potential tailwind in the months ahead. The chart below shows the monthly change in core CPI over the last 24 months. While it hasn‚Äôt exactly been linear, the trend is lower. In the twelve months from December 2021 through November 2022, eight out of twelve monthly prints were 0.5% or above, but in the last twelve months, only one print has been 0.5%.  > Just looking at the last year (shaded area in chart) it‚Äôs a similar trend. From December 2022 through May 2022, every monthly print was 0.4% or above, but in the most recent six months, every print has been 0.3% or below. If just the trend of the last six months remains in place, for the next six months the y/y reading will be replacing monthly prints of 0.4% or more with prints of 0.3% or less which should help to keep the trend of disinflation going.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-Core-CPI-Monthly-Change.png))**  *****  > # Small Business Sentiment Mixed Under the Hood  > The NFIB unveiled its latest look at small business sentiment early this morning. The headline number remains in the bottom decile of its historical range, falling 0.1 points to 90.6 in November. That is compared to expectations which called for the number to be unchanged last month.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-1.png))**  > Across the categories factoring into the index, breadth was mixed in November with four categories falling, four rising, and one unchanged. Like the headline number, many categories are also in the bottom few percentiles of their respective historical ranges, albeit with some exceptions like robust readings in plans to increase employment, current inventories, and job openings hard to fill.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-2.png))**  > As we discussed in our Morning Lineup, combining the report's readings on employment shows some rebounding conditions for labor markets over the past few months. Looking more closely, though, it is hard to say labor market conditions are materially accelerating. As shown, hiring plans have risen, but on net more companies are reporting negative employment changes. In a similar vein, compensation plans have risen sharply including a six point jump month over month in November (the largest one month increase since last October and the third largest on record), even though actual changes to compensation have been flat. Meanwhile, fewer businesses are reporting job openings are hard to fill. Small businesses are showing labor conditions have cooled over the past couple of years but are far from weak as any more recent improvements have been from plans rather than observed changes.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-4.png))**  > Similarly, sales expectations rebounded in November, contrary to a flat reading on actual sales and earnings changes. Perhaps most importantly, the share of businesses reporting higher prices has fallen down to 25, matching the July low. In combination with the higher reading on sales expectations, that likely helped the number of firms reporting now as a good time to expand.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-5.png))**  > Looking at the reverse, of those reporting now as not a good time to expand, the single biggest reason given for such sentiment was economic conditions. That is typically the most widely cited reason historically followed by political climate (the NFIB has a tendency to be sensitive to politics, namely which party holds the presidency), but for the first time in at least a decade, financial conditions and interest rates earned the number two spot. As shown below, the number of firms reporting that rates are holding them back from expanding has risen steadily since the current tightening cycle began.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-6b.png))**  > As mentioned previously, actual earnings changes saw no improvement in November and are sitting near historically weak levels. As for the reasons given for lower earnings, increased costs remain a key reason, but November also saw a significant jump in those reporting sales volumes as a problem. In other words, inflation and weaker demand appear to be weighing on small business earnings.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-5a.png))**  > Despite the burden of interest rates and expectations for credit conditions sitting at the lowest levels in over a decade, small businesses have actually increased capital expenditures dramatically to a new post-pandemic high. However, that is counter to capital expenditure plans, which have fallen in the past few months, and inventories showing drawdowns.  > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-6.png))**  *****  Here is the full list of companies report earnings for this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  > # ***Monday 12.18.23 Before Market Open:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]()) (NONE.)  > # ***Monday 12.18.23 After Market Close:***  > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/G9kJkCv.png))  *****  > # ***Tuesday 12.19.23 Before Market Open:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wuAEw5Q.png))  > # ***Tuesday 12.19.23 After Market Close:***  > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fSjaZjQ.png))  *****  > # ***Wednesday 12.20.23 Before Market Open:***  > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JNndzTW.png))  > # ***Wednesday 12.20.23 After Market Close:***  > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SJnw3ft.png))  *****  > # ***Thursday 12.21.23 Before Market Open:***  > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/N7CUSm7.png))  > # ***Thursday 12.21.23 After Market Close:***  > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XlSxDrb.png))  *****  > # ***Friday 12.22.23 Before Market Open:***  > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!]()) (NONE.)  *****  > # ***Friday 12.22.23 After Market Close:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]()) (NONE.)  *****  # DISCUSS!
