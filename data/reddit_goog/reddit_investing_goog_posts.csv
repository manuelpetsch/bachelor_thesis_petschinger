"Do you still feel confident investing in Google after the obliteration of the search results?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19egy4s/do_you_still_feel_confident_investing_in_google/";"Pretty simple question, if you have been using Google the past few years you may have noticed how poor the results have become. Particularly in certain areas of the internet like 'local' where currently if you search for best x in city for 98% of terms you just get fed whatever Yelp, TripAdvisor, or YellowPages list has the best keyword match in their title regardless of how old or relevant the actual content is.  5 to 10 years ago those results were filled with local newspapers, bloggers, tv stations, travel bloggers, and other small niche sites that actually had good boots on the ground info. Today they are just outdated lists that were often inaccurate from the start.   Don't believe me? Google 'best craft stores in city' or 'best art supply stores in city' and replace the word city with any of the 10 through 200 biggest cities in the US.... I'll bet dollars to donuts you find those 3 sites I just mentioned and little else in the top 5.  I know Google has all kinds of things going on with their company, I know the old search is dying (if not already dead) and AI results are coming, but at the end of the day search is Google's brand whether they want to admit it or not and for the last 3 or 4 years they have done nothing but go downhill in this regard.  If they don't care about their main thing and don't mind wasting all of our time with awful results for years.... is that really a company you want to invest in? As both an SEO and a Google user you can guess where I land on this.";"444";"2024-01-24T14:21:09"

I don't necessarily doubt they can release a great AI product, however I question how it will affect their revenue and how they would be able to monetise it without a huge shift in their revenue strategy.

I had set up automatic monthly contributions to my accounts, which I slowly raised over time and mostly invested in blue chip stocks.   On December 1, 2020, the combined value of my Roth and Traditional Brokerage account was just over $100k. It took me over seven years to get there and was a major milestone.  In the past three years, I have raised my monthly contributions, continued to invest, and am now just shy of $200k at the age of 35. You read about the power of compound gains all the time, but to go from $100k to $200k in three years when the first $100k took seven years is a testiment to that fact.  My goal is $1 mil by 47 and eventually to hit $2.5 mil before I retire.   For all you youngins out there, stick with it! But also, don't rush the process and try to hit home runs every day. For the most part, I am a buy and hold investor after a year or two of trying my hand at day trading with options and futures. When you chase the money, you won't make it. But if you’re patient with a decent risk tolerance, anything is possible.     Edit: Wow, thanks for the up votes everyone. It’s been fun reading the comments. Adding some context here based on some of the questions that have come in. Monthly contributions are at $1,000 a month now, but in the early years they were less. When I first started, it was $100 a month and I worked my way up from there. There was a good chunk of time where they were between $200-$500 a month. These accounts were set up on my own, no employer match. I’m not sure what my lifetime performance is, but the last three years I’m up 30% overall. All that in mind, I can confidently say that well over half of my account is due to investment gains.   Investments have been all individual stocks that I typically hold for a year or longer. I pick them based on both technical and fundamental factors. This is more risky than ETFs and index funds but it suits my investing style and risk tolerance. I try to stick to profitable companies with a stock price that has a history of moving in the right direction, however I also like to buy at a discount price. I keep my eyes on charts and when there’s opportunities to buy at historically undervalued prices I jump on it. There’s really nothing super special to it. Not going to share my current exact portfolio, but stocks I have owned in the past or currently include AAPL, GOOGL, META, COST, HD, MCD, DKNG, AMD, DIS, and BAC to name a few. There are many others I’m interested in buying that are on my watchlist.  I will also add that I’ve made a ton of mistakes along the way. Bad investments, selling too soon when I should of just held, taking risky, over leveraged day trades that resulted in nasty losses and wash sales. However, I’ve learned from them and never done anything bad enough that blew an account or resulted in a draw down that couldn’t be recovered. You can read all the books you want but I’ve always found that the best way is to learn by doing and over time you develop your own skills and are able to trust your own analysis and decisions.";"1684";"2023-11-18T17:51:37"

Here's how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates for the quarter ended in April:  EPS: $1.09, adjusted, versus 92 cents expected Revenue: $7.19 billion, versus $6.52 billion expected Nvidia said it expected sales of about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%, in the current quarter, more than 50% higher than Wall Street estimates of $7.15 billion.  Prior to the after-hours move, Nvidia stock was up 109% so far in 2023, mostly driven by optimism stemming from the company's leading position in the market for artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company was seeing ""surging demand"" for its data center products.  Nvidia's data center group reported $4.28 billion in sales, versus expectations of $3.9 billion, a 14% annual increase. Nvidia said that performance was driven by demand for its GPU chips from cloud vendors as well as large consumer internet companies, which use Nvidia chips to train and deploy generative AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.  Nvidia's strong performance in data center shows that AI chips are becoming increasingly important for cloud providers and other companies that run large numbers of servers.  However, Nvidia's gaming division, which includes the company's graphics cards for PC sales, reported a 38% drop in revenue to $2.24 billion in sales versus expectations of $1.98 billion. Nvidia blamed the decline on a slower macroeconomic environment as well as the ramp up of the company's latest GPUs for gaming.  Nvidia's automotive division, including chips and software to develop self-driving cars, grew 114% year over year, but remains small at under $300 million in sales for the quarter.  Net income for the quarter was $2.04 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with $1.62 billion, or 64 cents, during the year-earlier period. Nvidia's overall sales fell 13% from $8.29 billion a year ago.  *Personal take*: I don’t even know what to say, this is simply astonishing. The AFH price puts NVDA at 20% above its previous ATH. This jump would have been insane even for 2021, let alone the tech market of 2023.  AI will be the main focus and the main buzzword for the entire tech industry for the next few years, and I expect many companies to pivot toward that one way or another (even if it’s just paying PR lip service) in order to catch the wind in the sail.";"1365";"2023-05-25T04:13:21"

I'm trying to research Berkshire Hathaway, but the numbers I see online are inconsistent and don't make any sense. It seems like data reporting sites may be getting confused by the fact that Berkshire Hathaway has two different classes of shares - though it seems like this *should* be something really basic that financial reporting sites should be equipped to handle.  Google says there are currently 2,170,386,415 outstanding shares of BRK.B. At $409.59/share, that's a total value of all BRK.B shares of about $889 billion.  Google says there are currently 1.43 million outstanding shares of BRK.A. At $619,160.00/share, that's a total value of all BRK.A shares of about $885 billion.  Combined, that gives a total market cap for the company of about $1.8 trillion.  Google says Berkshire Hathaway's total earnings for 2023 were $96.2b.  Dividing that market cap by those earnings gives a PE ratio of about 18.7.  But when I just Google Berkshire Hathaway PE ratio directly, I get values like 9.47 - half of what I calculate manually.

"Has anyone invested through Serge Energy? Need tips - Offer seems too good to be true";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17t0uun/has_anyone_invested_through_serge_energy_need/";"Hey everyone,  Roughly two years ago I found a really nice investment opportunity (guaranteed minimum 10% annual ROI over the course of 5 years) in wooden pellets through Serge Energy, a company based in Finland.   I was a bit skeptical, so I did a ton of googling around and decided  to eventually go for it.  The amount I invested was fairly small, lets say 5k.  Over the last two years, everything has seemed fine and normal.   My account manager calls me every couple of months (6-10) to let me know how the market prices are, considering the price of pellets started spiking due to the invasion of Ukraine.  I received a few emails with additional investment opportunities, most of them with a ROI of 12-15% per year, but it didn't really seem anything out of the ordinary considering the price of pellets had been soaring so fast that those values were still below the selling market value.  I received an invitation to a event in Helsinki, at the HQ, regarding future investment opportunities (I didn't go, but it all seemed fine).  Roughly a week ago I received a more curious email. Not from my account manager, but from two Asset Growth Executives (their title in the signature of the email).  The email basically states that they found a number of birch trees on my patch of land (the one used to produce wooden pellets) and that this is a great financial turn, since these can be turned into sheets of Veneer which will be sold for roughly 5x my initial investment and the payout of this process will be in 3 months from now. And the process of pellets will keep running, but the payout will be delayed a year.  For this to go forward, I would need to do an additional payment of roughly 40% the initial investment value (which, once again, is a fairly low value), to pay for the processing fees of the third party company who handles the wood. Serge Energy would also keep their usual 10% of the sale price of the veneer sheets.  So, in short, is this legit?   Everything I google regarding the company comes out as being legit and I was fairly confident they were legit up until now -- since this really seems too good to be true.  Any feedbacks anyone?

Sure, I can find oodles of them on Google, but I have no sense of their competence or quality.  * People say ask around. But: 1) it’s a little awkward to talk about such things with all but closest friends: and 2) anyone I’ve asked so far either does everything in their own or they use high fee financial advisors. * Directories. I’ve been pointed to “directories” but these all reek of marketing tools so I never know if I can trust them. * People say “just interview advisors”.

Apple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet, then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family.      Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run.  And want to diversify to other chip makers, like AMD, Intel, and specialized ARM makers.     Small businesses experiment and run their AI models using rented Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud capacities (mostly Google because of their TPU's low power-to-cost ratio).      The rest of the market is peanuts to make any dent.      **\[Conclusions\]:** Their a moderate-low probability Q4 revenues will reach a plateau of around 15-20 billion.  A moderate probability that they will be below 15 billion. A low probability of exceeding 20 billion.  &#x200B:  ***Let's sidestep to AI marker TAM topic,***        [*Meanwhile, looking forward to 2027, the server market's value is estimated at a staggering $195.6 billion.*](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-ai-and-hpc-gpu-sales-reportedly-approached-half-a-million-units-in-q3-thanks-to-meta-facebook)   However, this estimated revenue will be brought by those who rent AI processing capacities like AWS, GCP, and Azure cloud providers.

[The average cost of 1 query from a used is 4 cents](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/).     A single user runs 2,000 queries per month on average. The query is a single text message you send to the chatbot.      2000 \* 0.04 = 80 $ to service 1 user per month.    Until the OpenAI level of efficiency improves they will be losing 70$ to service 1 user per month.    No wonder OpenAI has closed its ChatGPT Plus subscription.  It doesn't seem sustainable.     Last note,  the majority of data centers upgrade their equipment every 4-5 years. So, if AI expectations won't burst, and chip efficiency improves 10-fold, and other chip makers won't catch up, don't expect big tech to re-stock their chips earlier than the end of 2027.      &#x200B:";"1";"2024-01-21T23:17:52"

I'm my mind, it's obvious. Ignore everything else about Trump, just looking at the financials of this company, it's a social media platform that is not growing, and how people are buying on a hope and a prayer. It's a bubble, even the most generous evaluation of the stock says it's overvalued by a lot, the numbers simply do not match reality. And there is even a road map to when it would pop because in less then 6 months Trump can sell his stake.  I'm my mind it's perfect. I mean, the way you lose money on a short is you expect after X time, the stock went up, not down. But in this case, it seems like there is a very obvious time when it's going to crash, if not before. And as for going up???? Only if some massive tomfoolery happens.  My mom looked at me and said ""No, it's a scam, it's a pump and dump, we wouldn't make money.""

But then I thought wait, rule number 1 above all in the stock market or any gambling of any kind, ""the only sure thing is that there is never a sure thing.""  So, am I missing something?

"In Defense of Dividends (On a Million $ Portfolio)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15dnfnd/in_defense_of_dividends_on_a_million_portfolio/";"To start with, I'm 41 years old, and have been investing since I was 22. Right now, my portfolio is just around a million dollars - still waiting to get a $87k tax refund from the government. Here's a screenshot of my portfolio:  [https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg)  Edit: The portfolio total is in Canadian dollars. So convert US holdings like SCHD, VOO, IBTG etc from USD to CAD, and the total should add up.  Edit 2: You'll see that I'm not exclusively chasing dividends either. I have VOO, AVUV etc that have pretty poor dividends.  As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I'm not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.  Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about ""young"" investors chasing dividends: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why\_are\_many\_especially\_young\_people\_investing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/)  While I'm not exactly old, I'm not exactly young either. And here's why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.  **The Arguments for Dividends**  *1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money*  No investor thinks that dividends are ""free money"". Obviously money doesn't grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a ""gotcha"", but it's a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?  No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company's assets. So let's get that out of the way.  *2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital*  At a fundamental level, I don't care about stock prices. I care about only two things:  a) What is my income stream?  b) How fast is that income stream growing?  Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person's wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here's a quote from Great Expectations:  **""His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year""**  In his book ""The Four Pillars of Investing"", Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.  For me, I don't care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you're poor. At least for me. Doesn't matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.  *3. Dividends ARE From a Company's Earnings*  For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don't use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn't hard to understand.  *4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth*  Here's the big one. The theory goes that companies that don't pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn't want that?  Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. **That money was yours**. It's human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.  For a company to retain dividends, they need to *generate a higher return than their own current cashflow*. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That''s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they're promising that they'll get even *more* profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that's your gamble to make.  *5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow*  When you re-invest your dividends, you're purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven **they can already generate**. It's not pie-in-the-sky ""trust me bro"" cashflow. You know the company's track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You're buying more of the same. It's more secure.  *6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock*  The English used to have a saying:  **""Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!""**  People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.  For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It's stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.  *7. When a Company Fails, All You're Left with is Dividends*  Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it's in distress and that shareholders won't get the value of the company's assets, so that's a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.  Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.  *8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin*  What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.  What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.  *9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation*  The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:  Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.  For example, Microsoft's yield is low. But it's growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.  **Bottom Line**  No one denies that companies need to retain *some* earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty.

A little backstory, I'm 34, live with my father in the USA, have no large payments, only a few small ones and make 30k/year, $455/week. I have 11.5k saved up. I feel I should have started 10 years ago and that's why I'm trying to catch up.  So onto the investing and question.  Using my companies financial advisor, I started aggressively investing. Gave him 8k of my 11.5 and I am putting 355 of my 455/week into the investments. I only started the 355 transfers 2 weeks ago so I'm just starting the process. The financial advisor talks about a 15-17% deviation, and I understand that, but would it be wise to pull everything out if the US defaults. I know there are ups and downs of the stock market all the time and I know this is probably not a simple answer, but I have been googling and looking up stuff for days and can't really find solid information so I figured I would come to the investing subreddit.  It would be something that has never happened before but even in 2011 when we came the closest to defaulting, the markets took a steep drop. While googling though, I was seeing some places say even the S&P 500 would drop 20% or more if the US defaulted. So I was just looking for some opinions and what y'all would do if it does indeed happen. Keep your money in the stocks, or pull out so as not to loose too much and reinvest after, or ride it out and hope?  I know there's no solid information as to what would happen because it never has happened but even talking to my father, I believe inflation can't keep going up forever without something happening and continually raising the debt ceiling can't happen forever either. Just looking for some opinions/information.";"15";"2023-05-21T16:18:12"

Its main competitor Cruise is way behind in rides and GM said they'd be investing less in it for 2024.  I don't know what the timescale of Waymo's expansion into all major US cities (and beyond) will be but 2023 certainly bodes well for them being a huge player in the robotaxi market.

"Reddit files their S1 and is set for IPO";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b1go5k/reddit_files_their_s1_and_is_set_for_ipo/";"Reddit, Inc. files their S1, marking the first social media IPO since Pinterest five years ago. Here are some interesting takeaways for me…  \- Average revenue per user is $3.42, but that is buoyed heavily by the US cohort that has a $5 ARPU vs. $1 ARPU globally. Compare this to Facebook’s ARPU in US/Canada of $68.44.  \- 98% of revenue is from their ads (they have some freemium features but they never really made an impact) but the big question mark is can they monetize the API side and license their data to LLMs. Reddit’s $60m Google licensing deal right on the eve of this S1 is likely to build confidence there, but licensing still feels like the big unknown when it comes to monetization.  \- Reddit gets a massive portion of revenue from just a few top advertisers. CJ Gustafson notes in his analysis of the S1, “The company's advertising revenue is mainly derived from a small number of advertisers, with the top ten largest customers accounting for approximately 28% and 26% of its revenue for 2022 and 2023, respectively.”  \- R&D is 54% of revenue so they are investing heavily here. It feels like Reddit is looking to really lean into new monetization paths moving forward but these are untested.Overall, Reddit is one of the most anticipated IPOs of 2024 (dwarfed only by potentially Stripe).   I think there is a lot to be excited about, but also a lot of unknowns as Reddit moves to this next growth chapter.";"106";"2024-02-27T17:53:01"

"20 stocks till 2049 - buy and hold for 25 years";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19a10qn/20_stocks_till_2049_buy_and_hold_for_25_years/";"Hello. Apologies if this has already been posted in this community.   I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ.  https://archive.is/20231009181337/https://www.wsj.com/articles/picking-a-stock-for-the-year-2048-66d90e  The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.  So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold.   So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049.   Here is my list so far.   1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 ) 2. Costco 3. Johnson and Johnson 4. Waste Management 5. CVS 6. Home Depot 7. Boeing 8. Caterpillar 9. GE Aerospace 10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia 11. Walmart/Target 12. Starbucks / McDonalds 13. UPS 14. JP Morgan / Bank of America 15. Berkshire / Markel 16. Disney 17. Tesla / GM 18. Hershey 19. Dollar General 20. Lockheed Martin  Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate.   Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.  Edit: Some really good points in the comments.   1. Most of my regular investing goes to VOO. Think of this as a fun little experiment  2. Since all of these are mature large companies, maybe it makes more sense to go with mid cap stocks. In that case, what would you pick?";"126";"2024-01-18T22:13:00"

Is this really in the shareholders interest?  Volkswagen has around 180 Billion in debt. If they used their profits to reduce that debt instead of paying a dividend, future profits would grow since less interest payments would be needed. Also the company would be more safe and likely to survive a downturn or have the cash to invest (EV investments). Also the less debt VW has the cheaper the interest rate should be.  Instead they pay a high dividend even with high interest rates which could increase further. Why?";"135";"2023-07-06T07:22:12"

Scenario A.)  If the payout occurs quarterly, then it has an annual payout of 12 dollars, but will that still be represented by a 3.00 quarterly payout?  Scenario B.)  But if the payout is the annual payout of 3 dollars per year, then per quarter it will be $0.75.  Side-note. ) And how does the 30 Day SEC Yield play into all of this? Is that the tool that should be used to determine how much a dividend pays out within 30 days? Or is it some other figure that has nothing to do with dividends and am I overthinking the SEC Yield?

I mean iShares Core MSCIE world has by far the biggest fund of any of them, should I factor this in in some way? * What justifies some funds having higher TER's? What would be downsides or risks going with something like SPDR MSCI World UCITS ETF that has 0.12 TER? * How would you view ETF's age? Like is there particular upside or downside to something like Vanguard FTSE all-world UCITS ETF that seems to be less than 5 years old? * Would you view total holdings as important or is this a case of where 1400+ vs 3000+ companies doesn't really matter as in either case it would be plenty diversified?  Overall I'd just like to hear some views about which things people use to differentiate somewhat similar ETF's and make the decision to which one you buy.

"Day trading your current portfolio.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18z6myv/day_trading_your_current_portfolio/";"I run into this scenario quite a bit with my portfolio where a stock hits an all time high then a week later dips a solid 10-12 percent. Recently a stock I hold was up and I almost sold it all to wait on the dip (which happened after the 1st) this would have put 100k into my pocket before taxes. I however would have been on the hook for 15 percent of the 500k in gain. So is it worth the risk to put a net 25 in my pocket and hope I sell high and buy low?  I did this before to make quick cash, over 9 months I flipped apple, Amazon and Google back and forth for that time and made over 90k with this strategy which helped me when buying my home but again a huge stressful situation at that time.";"5";"2024-01-05T14:15:59"

"Quantum Computing: Bullish ($IONQ)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/14zufg6/quantum_computing_bullish_ionq/";"Hey y’all, I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole that is quantum computing and I’m convinced it will have some significant impact and scalable use cases within the coming years (5-10…+?).  When it comes to investment opportunities relating to emerging/experimental technologies, it can be difficult for retail investors to find early-stage direct investment opportunities.   BUT, the standout player, IonQ ($IONQ) is publicly traded. Here are some reasons why I’m bullish and think IonQ is oh, so special!  1. IonQ uses trapped ion/photonic computing!! This is really neat because it means their quantum computers do not need to be kept at FREEZING temps like QCs being created by Google, IBM, Rigetti and most others. (Among many other advantages)   Compared to the trapped ion approach, the qubits generated via superconducting suffer from short coherence times, high error rates, limited connectivity, and higher estimated error-correction overhead  2. Management is fairly new to running a public company but they seem excited and dedicated based off interviews and press releases: “The lead is ours. And we have full intention to take advantage of it.”  3. IonQ is the first and only quantum hardware integrated with all major cloud platforms and software kits!  4. 80% of their system is made outside of the US  5. 55+ US patents, 136 US patents pending, 7 foreign patents, 99 foreign patents pending, 8 US trademarks, 11 US trademarks pending, 17 international trademarks, 7 international trademarks pending  6. Their approach for the near term is to form a limited number of strategic partnerships to develop solutions that open up quantum advantage in select industry sectors (chem, pharma, finance, logistics).  7. What I think sets them apart the most, besides trapped ion, is their focus on scalability. Since their inception, Peter Chapman, their CEO, has been stressing the importance of their QCs being modular, economical, and serviceable. THIS, in my opinion, is the way. Whereas Google and IBM will have huge, frozen, immobile QCs available to contract via the cloud, IonQ will have a portable, scalable product.  $IONQ";"18";"2023-07-15T00:37:10"

Instead of buying an S&P 500 ETF like SPY or VOO, we’d buy a “direct index” of the S&P 500. It’s all automatically done, and the software buys the underlying stocks of the S&P 500 and constantly rebalances and finds capital losses. For example, if Microsoft is down, the algorithm sells it to buy something else that is correlated within the index, and comes back into Microsoft 30 days later.  Basically:  * It tracks the index very closely, pretty much just as good as SPY or VOO * It generate 45% of the investment amount in capital losses over 10 years, with the bulk of that in the first 5 years * The capital losses are used to shield against capital gains * The tax savings from saved capital gains dollars are reinvested back into the direct index, generating on average 2% more than without itI  I modeled it out here      [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tnf-iW6u1iOfkb6tjX3O863MPzd4QoFrcJ6liGC\_vKs/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tnf-iW6u1iOfkb6tjX3O863MPzd4QoFrcJ6liGC_vKs/edit#gid=0)   Anyone consider direct indexing before?

Here's the pitch:   Currently, there's very limited creator economy access for retail investors (a $240 billion market). What do you think about the idea of content creators converting their audience into channel investors? Investors would get a portion of the creators channel revenue in return for cash upfront, similar to crowdfunding. Investors would only have the right to revenue with NO ownership/control interest.   Say a creator sells 20% of their channel revenue. This would be split into a few thousand 'units' (not shares), priced according to the channels valuation. These units would pay out a yield, similar to a bonds monthly coupon, but without a maturity date, that can be sold on a secondary market. Value of the units will change based on supply and demand and channel performance.     **Benefits:**   Financially incentivising audiences to share and engage more with content might help solve a lot of organic growth problems creators face, give creators the same capital raising opportunities as other businesses and unlock the $240 billion creator economy for the retail investment market.

"Booking Holdings stock analysis (Burry's 4th Largest Holding)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1abie8p/booking_holdings_stock_analysis_burrys_4th/";"Hi everyone, I hope you are all well. I want to share my thoughts on Booking as a company since I think Booking is interesting. If you're looking for a superficial analysis and don't like reading, look elsewhere. This isn't a superficial analysis, which is what is typically shared. I'll share why I think Booking might be differentiated from major competitors like Expedia and AirBnb. I'll also do an overview of the economics of the business, then write about the industry and competitors and estimate the intrinsic value. As I am sure all of you know, this is just my thoughts so please do your own research. I hope I provide some insights and I welcome an exchange of ideas.  # Company Overview:  Booking is an online travel agency (OTA). It is a parent company that holds a number of brands such as Booking, KAYAK, RentalCars, Priceline, Agoda and Opentable. As a whole, Booking provides reservation services for customers looking for accommodations, flights, rental cars, taxis, and restaurants. There is a lot interplay between these brands.  Booking categories their revenue as Agency, Merchant & Advertising & Other:  Revenue *(In millions)*  ||**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**2016**|**2015**|2014| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Agency|$9,003|$6,663|$4,314|$10,117|$10,480|$9,714|$7,982|$6,527|$5,845| |Merchant|$7,193|$3,696|$2,117|$3,830|$2,987|$1,891|$1,620|$1,450|$1,329| |Advertising & Other|$894|$599|$365|$1,119|$1,060|$834|$713|$613|$410| |**Total**|**$17,090**|**$10,958**|**$6,796**|**$15,066**|**$14,527**|**$12,439**|**$10,314**|**$8,591**|**$7,584**|  Booking mainly generates revenue on commissions. Agency revenue is when Booking makes a reservation for a customer but does not facilitate payment: the supplier (hotels, airlines, etc) will follow up with the customer for payment. Merchant revenue is when Booking acts as a merchant: i.e. collect payment and remits payment to supplier. Bookings earns commission on both of these categories.  Merchant revenue is catching up and increasing its percentage as a proportion of total revenue and although this doesn't negatively impact Booking in regards to its position in the industry, it does negatively impact their margins.  Operating Margins:   |**2014**|**2015**|**2016**|**2017**|**2018**|**2019**|**2020**|**2021**|**2022**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |42.2%|40.5%|37.92%|28.18%|36.48%|36.7%|35.48%|\-9.28%|22.78%|  \*We can see that as the merchant category increases as a proportion of sales, operating margins are decreasing. Merchant revenue incurs additional expenses.  ***Advertising & Other*** is revenue mainly earned by KAYAK for its meta-search platform: This platform lists hotel chains, flights, etc on its website. ***I am going to disregard this segment because Google Flights does the same thing, so I am estimating no growth here. Some people view Google as a competitor to Booking, and they do compete against KAYAK. However, Google benefits Booking's Agency and Merchant business since Google refers a lot of people to Bookings platforms. Google is ultimately an advertising business, they don't make reservations or facilitate payments.***  Marketing Expense as a % of Total Revenue:   |**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**2016**|**2015**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |35%|34.6%|32%|32.9%|34.1%|36.2%|35.4%|35%|  \* Booking spends a lot on marketing and a lot of this spend is performance marketing on Google.  Room nights booked *(in mill):*  |**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |896|591|355|845|  \*What I like about this data is that room nights booked (one night booked = one room night) in 2022 is higher than 2019, which was the record prior to COVID. Room nights have been increasing significantly in geographical areas (like Asia-Pacific) which has lower average daily rates compared to areas like Europe and the U.S. This also impacts their margins.  # Competitors:  Bookings Mix of Room nights for hotels and alternative accommodation:  |||||| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| ||**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**| |Hotels, Motels, Resorts|70%|71%|\--|71%| |Alternative|30%|29%|\--|29%|  **AirBnb:**  The way I am thinking about this is 70% of Bookings accommodations are in hotels and motels and AirBnb mainly generate revenue from homes, holiday houses etc. This is only 30% of Bookings business, which they list as alternative. Although these two companies compete, I don't think it will affect Booking if Airbnb continues to grow since they don't specialise in hotel accommodations. I am curious to know your thoughts about this.  **Website Traffic:**  Expedia: 88.68% website traffic in the U.S.  Airbnb: 71.54% website traffic in the U.S  ***Booking: 10.86% website traffic in the U.S***  Most of Bookings website traffic is concentrated in Europe whereas Expedia and Airbnb is concentrated in the U.S. I believe this has other implications, especially when I compare Booking with Expedia that has a business model that is almost identical. Most of the hotel chains in the U.S are very popular: Marriott, Holiday Inn, Hilton, Hampton Inn and Hyatt to name a few. They have their own loyalty programs and big marketing and merchandising (cheap deals) campaigns and customers often seek these hotels out directly, although they are listed on Expedia as well. Since they are popular, they have bargaining power and can request lower commissions to be listed on an OTA. Since Expedia is heavily concentrated in the United States, this has an impact on their margins. Most of Bookings hotel suppliers are outside of the U.S. and these are often smaller, independent chains that rely more heavily on an OTA.

The growth rates are estimated because of the industry growth projections and Bookings position in the market. Also the 5-year previous growth rates for Booking was 8%, which was the lowest compared to my 1-3-7 and 9 years growth rates so I went with that. 8% is a lower growth rate than the industry growth projections and I wanted to be conservative, especially since the FCF in the current year is at record highs. I always like putting a lower growth rate in the latter half (6%) because it is a lot harder to estimate. The discount rate is high, however, my style has always been to make fewer bets for higher returns and I am happy being patient until those opportunities arrive.

"1 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/";"Last year there was a post asking what folks were doing to profit from the current/upcoming recession on Hacker News: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33040211](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33040211)  I replied ([https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33041751](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33041751)) that I purchased some pandemic stocks, which I started doing in April 2022. Most of my purchasing was through summer 2022, but I've bought others more recently, like Carvana on the dip in December (which luckily popped since it became a meme stock), as well as Meta, Amazon and Google on the dips in October. The most recent was Allbirds on the dip in March since I had just purchased the shoes and they quickly became my favorite.  Overall, I'm up 36%, but as you can imagine a few winners (which I luckily have larger stakes in) make up for the losers. My target timeline is \~3 years, and we could still see a deeper recession from a hard landing, so I plan to post more annual updates.  There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I've summarized each with the overall unrealized gain/loss so far as of this morning:  * Affirm: -11.33% * Amazon: +25.25% * Allbirds: +9.43% * Coinbase: -34.32% * Carvana: +306.5% * Google: +29.35% * Meta: +170.89% * Cloudflare: +14.35% * Netflix: +97.08% * Peloton: -54.61% * Roblox: +25.14% * Shopify: +39.26% * Snapchat: +3.21% * Snowflake: +11.14% * Unity: +8.91%  **Some commentary**  It's hard to convey how much of a roller coaster the the last 12 months have been, with some pretty large negative swings that I just had to watch and not react to. There are likely more to come, especially since it seems a lot of the potential good news is already priced in.  Interestingly, in that post I mentioned Peloton was one I regretted almost instantly, and is now my worst performer by far. Unfortunately, greed got the best of me and I caught that falling knife buying a few times as the stock dropped further. I was hoping they would get rid of the excess inventory, improve distribution and double down on subscriptions to turn things around, but that hasn't materialized. Maybe it still will, or they get acquired.  Despite the strong gains, I still feel Shopify (improved focus, strong brand), Netflix (new ad tier, other new streaming services struggling and likely to go back to content), and Meta (improved targeting post privacy changes + AI opportunities) still have good upside potential.  I also really like Microsoft due to their enterprise moat and opportunities with AI, but their stock never had the correction the other stocks did and that was the scent I was chasing at the time (right or wrong). But long-term, I also wonder if AI will negate the need for human productivity software since the AI can just do it and review/edit mode requires less bloat (e.g. video with Final Cut Pro vs. TikTok, or images with Photoshop vs. Instagram). I wouldn't doubt if we see an AI-native productivity suite that doesn't just integrate AI, but predicated on simplfy reviewing AI generated content.  I'm disappointed to have missed Nvidia (up 3X since October) since I used to own it and have been watching it since the crypto bust created excess inventory and a predictable dip, then the AI trend led to the recovery. The valuation feels rich, but could easily grow into it given the trajectory of AI, unless the hyperscalers make their own chips.  Perhaps counterintuitively, it seems it's more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts than financial analysts/stock pickers since, at the end of the day, you need to make your own decisions about the fundamentals and prospects of the business. Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but by definition backward looking while valuation is forward looking.  I'm curious to see how these perform if the US enters a broader recession in the next 18 months. I don't plan to sell unless something catastrophic happens and I see a better opportunity to shift to.  **Update \~6mo later here:** https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15\_year\_followup\_on\_buying\_the\_dip\_on\_pandemic/";"175";"2023-06-12T21:18:14"

I'm in Japan and the yen is weak right now so I wanted a Japanese yen currency-hedged high yield USD bond ETF (i-Shares HYG with JPY hedge, TYO 1497), so that if the yen gets strong again, I won't lose money on the exchange rate.  But the yen has been getting WEAKER since I bought it in the summer, meaning the shares I bought in USD are now worth more in yen. I didn't expect to profit off that with a hedged ETF, but I was surprised to see that rather than keep the price difference neutral, the opposite was happening: the ETF is falling in value even though the original HYG ETF has been going up:  https://www.google.com/finance/quote/HYG:NYSEARCA?hl=en&comparison=TYO%3A1497&window=1Y  Does this mean that the ETF will continue to lose money if the yen continues to weaken?

I am just saying in order to be in a bubble, we would have to have extremely pessimistic assumptions about growth.  That companies still delivering massive returns will suddenly become terrible businesses that can barely grow at inflation.  While some names are extremely speculative and require many things to go right, I think people create a blanket statement that the entirety of the market or even all of Mag 7 is in a bubble.  And it's incredibly wrong and unfair.  MSFT for example just increased earnings 20% YoY.  Those are impressive numbers for a small company, let alone a behemoth with their size and stability.  GOOGL increased earnings YoY close to **a whopping 60% YoY**.  When it was recently trading at $130 due to fears they would fall behind in the AI race, people were still saying it needed to drop 20% and it would still be ""bubble territory"".  IMHO valuations are actually extremely fair and reflect the strength of these incredible companies that are some of the most powerful to ever exist.  People are comparing valuations with history to post GFC when enormous amounts of capital was destroyed, there was extreme risk / fear of another collapse.    I think the correct conclusion is that with hindsight we are realizing those valuations were too penalizing and cheap.  Not that today is too high and incorrect.";"0";"2024-04-27T18:17:49"

I have some ideas why but am I missing anything?  1. T-bills at present offer a slightly higher interest rate. 2. T-bills have no expense ratio.  My guess is that is the reason for number 1 above. 3. T-bills rate won't change during the holding period. It's set until maturity. MM fund yields fluctuate. 4. T-bills can be traded.  For a profit sometimes. Or you can hold until maturity.  While Money Market funds have these advantages:  1. MM funds are more liquid.  You can cash out any time instantly. You can even write checks on a Money Market fund. 2. MM Funds could maybe be taxed at a lower rate if held long enouht to be considered long term capital gains. 3. MM Funds don't come with commissions in your brokage account by T-bills might.  I use Fidelity.  Did I miss anything?  My goal is to just make the most interest on money I don't intend to invest in the stock market for 6 months to a year.  So I've been considering T-bills for 6m or maybe 1 year maturity.   But then I look and the MM funds in my sweep or ""core"" accounts and they yield only a little lower.  With T-bills I GUESS it's about locking in a hopefully high rate if you expect interest rates to go down soon.  But right or wrong I don't. Not in the near future anyways.  T-notes or T-Bonds for longer terms I would think would be better for locking in what you THINK are going to be higher rates than possible lower rates a few years out.

I am planning on buying a home soon and will need 3% down for the purchase, my goal here is to save up 12k as fast as possible which shouldnt be too difficult.      My plan: Put xxxx amount of money per paycheck into my brokerage account as a way of storing my money there (I am too impulsive to keep it in my savings or checking account, this is a different issue I am working on lol). Say in 6 months I have 12k which would mostly be my contributions and maybe a tiny bit of growth, for example keeping in SPAXX or buying SCHD would have a small yield in 6mo and maybe even a loss but thats besides the point. When I pull this money out and sell my spaxx or schd, is this now considered capital gains tax on the full 12k? would it be only on any slight earnings I made?      Please let me know if this is a terrible plan due to tax implications or if this is a good idea of locking away and saving money for an impulse buyer?";"1";"2024-03-23T00:12:34"

It made me wonder if there are simple ways to avoid paying such a tax by using options. Specifically, selling a call option with a strike price of 0 or close to 0. That way you receive (nearly) the full value of the shares plus a tiny bit of premium, essentially neutralizing your position but not liquidating it. Then you just roll over the call options every few years and postpone paying taxes until one day your children inherit the stocks. As far as I understand in most countries  they don't have to pay capital gains when they sell. You even keep receiving the dividend for all those years whilst using the money for other investments.   Are there serious flaws in my reasoning or have I just bankrupted every government that charges capital gains tax with my genius? :-)";"117";"2023-06-19T12:54:39"

Currently, I am 27 years old and have been investing for about five years. This is an update on my current situation: I worked as an IT/Business consultant for my first employer for three years, and now I am a data analyst consultant at a new job. My current salary looks like this:  * \~€2650 net * \~€160 meal vouchers * Company car & fuel card * Pension savings ('Group insurance') to which \~€130 is added each month * The 'usual' (insurance, holiday pay, 13th month, ...)    Since the last posts, my investment portfolio changed quite a lot. The total amount at the time of writing is hovering around **€149.000**:  * ETFs: Invested €33.000, now it is worth €44.000+ * Cryptocurrencies: Invested €5000, now it is worth €45.000 * Cash: €10.000 * Retirement funds: €4.000+ * Personal Companies: \~€35.000    * Used €30.000 to start a small **real estate company** with 2 friends. We've done 2 projects since (flipping 2 apartments) but I'm still waiting on the final year overview from the accountant to update the €30.000 to the actual value right now.    * The other €5.000 was invested in a business I recently took over together with my girlfriend. This business is a **fry shop** (called 'frituur' in Dutch) which is now running for a little over a month. Of course, we took a loan from the bank as well. It is still too early to update the value of this company. * Real Estate: \~€30.000 in equity. This is the building that we bought together with the 'frituur' business mentioned above. We are in the process of renovating the apartment on the first floor so we can actually live there as well in a couple of months. * A personal loan from my parents - €20.000. I took this out the finance the real estate that we bought. In this way, I didn't have to sell any investments.

Googling his name, he's on several of these ""Top investors to look out for in 202X"" articles from Forbes and such, but I'm pretty skeptical of the performance and I'm unsure if I'm being overly critical or not.   The biggest concern to me is that 2022's net return was -42.86%. I know that the entire market was suffering at the time, but this is more than twice the percentage that the S&P500 was down that year. Furthermore, my dad's plan from the beginning was to retire 5 years from now. How did the investor manage to lose so much value in what should have been a very conservative asset allocation?  Over the 4 years, he has outperformed the S&P500 for one of them. I interpret these results like so: we have greater volatility and risk than we would with a passively managed S&P500 ETF like VOO, while also getting less return on market upswings. I'm by no means a professional investor myself and I could be looking at it through the wrong lens, but my gut instinct is that my dad needs a new portfolio manager. Are there other metrics through which I should be judging this investor's performance? Additional insight would be greatly appreciated. I should add that he charges 1% of the value of the portfolio per year for his services.";"35";"2024-04-10T18:40:53"

"10-Year Treasury interest rates are determined mostly by nominal GDP";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17o0mrh/10year_treasury_interest_rates_are_determined/";"The 10-Year Treasury is the foundation of the world's financial economy, and as such understanding it is important. There is a great deal of incorrect or useless (that is, not investable) analysis out there, so here is a report on what I have discovered thus far. Corrections or more quantitative ideas are welcome.   See the figures at [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UkFnTOhypgwb6\_qa6o1usJmZndlpPSFvtS7jA0dfCFk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UkFnTOhypgwb6_qa6o1usJmZndlpPSFvtS7jA0dfCFk/edit?usp=sharing). In the top left, there is a chart of the 10-year treasury yield, Nominal GDP growth, and CPI growth. GDP growth and CPI growth are smoothed by using a 10-year, backward looking compound-annual-growth-rate (CAGR). It becomes apparent that yield is highly correlated with nominal GDP growth. This makes sense because if yield falls much below GDP growth, it would be possible to invest in other things to get a higher return, and yields would have to rise. If yields goes much higher than GDP growth, then everyone would buy treasuries and push the yield down.  In times when the yield is higher than GDP growth, the market (influenced by the fed and treasury) is tight. When the yield is lower than GDP growth, the market is loose. Recently, the market has flipped from very loose to moderately tight. Note that the exact point where things move from loose to tight is a philosophical discussion with no clear and useful answer that I'm aware of. The fed and treasury cannot move interest rates too far from nominal GDP growth, because it will damage the financial system. If they are super loose, will we have runaway inflation. If they are super tight, we will have a depression induced by a massive leverage unwinding.  The next two charts plot the correlation between Yield and Nominal GDP growth (R\^2 = 0.841) or CPI growth (R\^2 = 0.803) and show that the correlation is very high.  Whenever I see a correlation like this, I check to see if it can be used to predict returns. In this case, I predict the 1-year return of a 10-year treasury. The next three charts shows that the return can be predicted with yield (R\^2 = 0.277), CPI growth (R\^2 = 0.136), or GDP  growth (R\^2 = 0.101). That's three useful variables, so I combine them into a multi-dimensional linear regression (in the next row), and get an R\^2 of 0.4548. Not too shabby. That correlation is high enough to help drive investment decisions.  Currently, the expected 1-year return of a 10-year Treasury is 7.1% +/- 15%. It's not a sure thing, but it is a better bet to invest in 10-year Treasuries over T-bills at this time, if you have risk tolerance and a longer time horizon.  In the next section, I analyze more to see which variables are important. I do this by measuring how much each variable improves R\^2 after the previous two are included. I find that yield adds 0.31, GDP growth adds 0.12, and CPI growth adds 0.01. So CPI doesn't really add anything. Note that CPI is part of nominal GDP (which equals real GDP + CPI).  I then did a fit of just GDP CAGR minus Yield vs Return and get and R\^2 of 0.44. So that tells us that GDP CAGR minus 10-year treasury yield is really the important quantity here.  This analysis is inspired by a slide from Aswath Damodaran: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcywXZAbB8U&t=557s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcywXZAbB8U&t=557s), but I extend beyond that into a prediction of future returns.";"41";"2023-11-05T02:06:36"

"How Much Is Tesla Worth? You Decide";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/16uiioh/how_much_is_tesla_worth_you_decide/";"Wall Street Journal out with an article that lets you plug in 5 simple variables to get a valuation for Tesla.  The 5 variables are: how many cars Tesla sells in 2030, average selling price of a Tesla car in 2030 in today’s dollars, operating margin, cost of capital, and how much Tesla’s other operations are worth.  The Wall Street Journal has 4 pre-set scenarios:  1. Bearish - $58.5 billion valuation based on 5 million cars at $30k with 8% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $0 valuation for other operations besides cars  2. Default - $381 billion valuation based on 7 million cars at $30k with 10% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $200 billion valuation for other operations.  3. Bullish - $770 billion valuation based on 10 million cars at $30k with 12% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, $400 billion for other operations  4. Superfan - $2.33 trillion valuation based on 20 million cars at $30k with 15% operating margin, 8% cost of capital, $600 billion for other operations  Their assumptions are as follows:  > Our model is based on estimates of Tesla’s future cash flows. It multiplies anticipated vehicle sales in 2030 by the average anticipated price to calculate revenue, and then applies the expected operating margin to arrive at operating profit. Estimates for the years before 2030 assume a smooth path in the variables from this year’s FactSet analyst consensus.  > Operating profit is taxed at an 11% rate (FactSet consensus for Tesla in 2023). Cash flows are then calculated as posttax operating profit minus capital expenditures while adding back depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures are assumed to be a flat 7% of revenue and depreciation and amortization 20% of capital expenditures.  > Estimated cash flows through 2030 are discounted back to their present value at the discount rate and aggregated. A terminal value is added to account for Tesla’s cash flows beyond 2030, assuming a steady-state growth rate of 5%. The total of all these discounted estimated cash flows gives the theoretical enterprise value of Tesla’s core automotive business now.  > We have left the value of its other businesses as a separate assumption within the model to arrive at a total enterprise value. Market value would also include the company’s cash or debt position, which we have not modeled.  Personally, as a Tesla bull who owns the stock, I believe Tesla is worth north of $1 trillion based on 10 million cars at $38k and 17% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, and $200B for other operations. I also believe that assuming 5% terminal growth post 2030 is too low.   What do you think?  https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/how-much-is-tesla-worth-you-decide-78b25ab1";"0";"2023-09-28T17:07:54"

I know selling stocks at a loss isn't ideal but I understand it could be a net gain over paying the taxes.

The goal here would be deposit the max for each year in one lump sum so I can let it sit and not think about it until 2025. Say I win the lottery, get a lot of commission at my sales gig, or get a new job in the next month after I’ve maxed out 2023 and 2024 and have an income over the limit to contribute to a Roth IRA in 2024, would I be penalized on my early contributions or need to pull them out? (Edit: for some reason Schwab has 2024 as an option alongside 2023 to contribute which is why I thought you could contribute early)  2. I don’t know if it’s specific to Schwab that I can contribute early to 2024, but if anyone knows, when would they open the option to contribute early to 2025?

"[D] The Question facing Nvidia";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/13l5gc0/d_the_question_facing_nvidia/";"The problem this stock faces is no one knows how to value it.  The company are investing in technology that opens up new markets (AI, Omniverse and self driving for example).  Will those markets pan out or will they go bust?  And if they do pan out, what's the value of those markets?    Nobody knows, these markets haven't been served before.  Today's share price is a reflection of the market sentiment, the voting machine's results as of this moment.   The current share price is either grossly over extended or grossly undervalued -- there is no in between in my opinion.  I believe Nvidia has cemented itself as the hardware technology leadership company of the era, much like IBM and Intel of past decades.   Some on Wall St understand this, others are coming to understand it.  But there are many who doubt that is the case as well.  The most obvious question from doubters is about competition:  Won't AMD or Intel or Google or Apple just come in with better technology and take their position?  I've been invested in this company for more than 15 years and what they do uniquely are two things:  1.  Strategize and 2.  Execute.   They have been building a GPGPU platform (General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit), otherwise known as ""accelerated computing"" since about 2007.   It's different from standard CPUs in that it processes massive amounts of data in parallel, tens of thousands of ""cores"" operating at the same time.  Their platform is a combination of inter-generational compatible hardware and software.  The platform is robust, reliable, well supported, offers regular performance improvements, and is now ubiquitous with over 4million developers using it including nearly every AI developer on the planet.  So when a competitor comes to throw their hat in the ring, there is an enormous defensive position to overcome that includes a large user base who are getting reliable, quantifiable and predictable results.    Since 2014 predictions of Nvidia's demise in the data center have been constant from both mammoth technology companies (AMD, Intel, Google, Baidu) and startups alike.    But no one has been able to make a real dent in Nvidia's momentum and share -- not with CPUs, ASICs, FPGAs or any other technology.  In their core area of AI model training, Nvidia has between 85-95% market share depending on whose numbers you look at.   They are serving this with the largest, most complex mass produced semiconductor devices man can imagine.  What about other GPUs?   GPUs have proven an excellent solution for the job, they are readily available, flexible and performant.  AMD and Intel are building new GPUs and pursuing as "" AI is their number 1 priority.""  I expect these companies to pick up some business simply because Nvidia cannot service 100% of the demand they are creating.  But these well-regarded companies have a difficult hill to climb in software.  They need to make their products work as well as Nvidia's to be competitive, if they don't they will likely sell at a deep discount.  A ""real"" competitive offering will have to exceed Nvidia's solution in both performance and ease of use.   I haven't seen that sort of competitor surface in the past 10 years, nor can I see one on the horizon.  There may be one lurking -- certainly a possibility -- but it will take 2-4 years minimum for that type of solution to come to market.   In the mean time, Nvidia is out re-architecting data centers with AI-centric chip solutions:  CPUs, GPUs, DPUs and networking and switching technology.  They continue to raise the bar for competitors.  Soon data center processing will be managed by AI techniques to yield better, faster, more power efficient results sooner.     Nvidia owns data center acceleration -- the nexus of AI -- for the near term.  Is AI a real technology that has launched and will add value to human kind in innumerable ways, or does it sputter and fizzle into another ""AI winter"" from whence Nvidia becomes a footnote in history?   That is the question on this company's share price.  FPE, PS, DCF ?  These are just irrelevant metrics in this context.";"91";"2023-05-18T19:39:57"

I now know more about the stock market and trading/investing in general.   My question basically is would I be better off taking the accumulated funds from the fund and just allocating it into the top 10 stocks like AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA, NVDA etc? Is there any real benefit of using an index fund?  The only thing I can think of is I would probably be unable to use a Stock and Shares ISA (equivalent to a Roth IRA, I think) as my index fund uses GBP even though the fund tracks US stocks. To my understanding as soon as I make investments in USD I can no longer use the ISA. From the UK for context.  EDIT: Thank you all for your input.

But when you take funds that hold 10's, 100's and even 1000's of different stocks (or other commodities, like valuable materials, forex and others), the fund themselves are traded as if they were regular stocks, so their prices are subject to the same market pressures. I'm sure not many traders go check each underlying commodity's value, multiply it by its percentage held into the fund and estimate its overall value before setting a price to either buy or sell it, so my question is : what forces or processes keep the trading value of such investment products within a certain range of the cumulative sum of what they are composed of, instead of having its own value on the markets?

"Annual year-end explanation for large, unexpected drops in your fund";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18g1v6c/annual_yearend_explanation_for_large_unexpected/";" Please read before posting.  A mutual fund is pooled investment vehicle with a basket of individual stocks/bonds/whatever.  Within the fund, the fund managers are constantly selling/buying and receiving dividends. The IRS has special rules for mutual funds which allow them to not pay taxes on the capital gains/dividends generated provided they pass through almost all of the proceeds from said activities to the shareholder within the calendar year. So, dividends are often paid on some set schedule but capital gains are generally retained within the fund till the end of the year (because losses can reduce gains but can't be distributed to a shareholder).  So on to why your fund dropped: in mid-December everyone starts distributing these gains and as we know when a fund makes a distribution its NAV drops by an equal amount. For example - a fund that was trading at $10 and had It's value made up of $9 worth of stock and $1 worth of cash to be distributed now no longer has that $1. So it'll drop by 10% because of that fact. Don't worry, you didn't lose any money because the $1 was paid to you in cash (and in most cases reinvested in the form of buying more shares).  There isn't any value created or lost in a distribution (except to taxes) it's just a necessary taxable transaction that must occur because of how mutual funds are structured. ETFs are technically subject to this as well but since most follow passive cap weighted strategies or use the creation/redemption to wash out appreciated shares so they don't usually have capital gains realized to distribute.  Also please feel free to add whatever questions/comments you have to this sticky.  Here's a quick way to see what capital gains estimates/distribution dates are for most funds: [https://mutualfundobserver.com/discuss/discussion/56970/2020-capital-gains-estimates](https://mutualfundobserver.com/discuss/discussion/56970/2020-capital-gains-estimates).

My only thought is if the account is not properly managed a downswing in the market could margin call the fund. If it’s double leveraged it would have to take a 50%+ crash to trigger this.
