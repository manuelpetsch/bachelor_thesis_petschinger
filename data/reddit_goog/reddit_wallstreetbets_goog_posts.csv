Despite their AI efforts and initiatives the past 6 months Microsoft is clearly eating their lunch with bing gaining ground on Google when it comes to search and overall ad revenue.   The 9.67% down day is completely justified due to Google cloud's dreadful growth which will be Google's unbecoming. Google ONLY made 8.42 billion dollars compared to 8.64 billion dollars expectation which can result into a going concern for bankruptcy. AI is not Google's strong suit and they have overpaid for YouTube sports which will net them no profits.   Overall tiktok and Microsoft will make Google obsolete as AI advanced and tiktok becomes the new YouTube for content creators and seekers of entertainment.";"2151";"2023-10-26T04:01:24"
"What's up with Google?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1b6ubqc/whats_up_with_google/";"Google is not participating in this AI rally and we are all left wondering why. In fact it just did a double top with its 2021/22 high and  is down 15% already.     Back in 2017, some Google researchers wrote a paper that changed the game of AI forever. It was called ""Attention is all you need"" and it introduced a new way of building AI models using something called Transformers (no not that one). These models were so powerful and versatile that they could do anything from natural language processing to computer vision to music generation. Because it was open source, everyone and their mother started using Transformers for their AI projects, including Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic.      And Google? They've been playing catch-up ever since. I have always wondered why they just gave away their secret sauce for free? Can you imagine if google had a patent on the Transformer Architecture or if they had developed it first before releasing to the world?   Is this incompetence, bureaucracy or something else?

Typically, layoffs are bullish, but I speculate that in this case, it is **Very** **Bullish**.  Why?  # AI.  See: [ChatGPT Passes Google Coding Interview for Level 3 Engineer With $183K Salary](https://www.pcmag.com/news/chatgpt-passes-google-coding-interview-for-level-3-engineer-with-183k-salary)  That's right.  Your favorite fucking slur word against bears when they make complete sense about overvaluation and bubbles and what-not.  I spek-ulate these positions will be replaced by AI, and the $183,000 engineering salary for these high cost of living areas will be put back in the pocket of the company.  Multiply that by 701 employees getting the boot, and that is $128,283,000 saved and put onto the market cap of the company, which isn't a lot, but we are just getting started with integration.  I know that is outrageously optimistic and there are sure to be HR staff, Graphic Artists, DEI Leaders, Janitors, and whatever other clowns that google has hired among some of the top salaries in the country.  Instead of losing manpower however, it is being replaced by a more agile technology that has a much lower operating cost.  This is what makes it different than your average layoff of a bloated employee pool.  Also,  What they did not disclose to the government is they have began laying off contractors in oregon for the Youtube Music Side of things.  The massive amount of subtitle work for every youtube song and podcast can now be automated.  I'm marking it as a discussion not DD since I feel it's a fairly simple strategy.

"GOOG: The Guy Who Killed Yahoo Search is Now Running Google's";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cbrwwz/goog_the_guy_who_killed_yahoo_search_is_now/";"So I was digging around and found out that Prabhakar Raghavan, the head of Google Search, used to be the head of search at Yahoo from 2005 to 2012. And let me tell you, it's not a pretty story. During his time at Yahoo, the company's search market share PLUMMETED from 30.4% to 13.4%. Yeah, you read that right - it was a FREE FALL. And it's not like he was just a bystander, he was in charge of research and development for Yahoo's search and ads products. But wait, it gets better. Under his leadership, Yahoo's search market share DECLINED FOR 9 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS. And to top it all off, Yahoo had its LARGEST LAYOFFS IN CORPORATE HISTORY at the time, cutting nearly 2,000 jobs. Is this a risk to GOOG long-term healthy growth? Have they started prioritizing short-term ad revenue over user experience, flooding search results with spam and ads to inflate earnings?

"You missed META, NFLX, GOOGL? Try AAPL";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqq2iz/you_missed_meta_nflx_googl_try_aapl/";"I think AAPL is an obvious play. It hasn't participated in this 2024 rally at all and is due for a catch-up play. Two main reasons why AAPL has been lagging: slowing growth (mainly China) and lack of AI hype. The slowing growth is priced into the stock. Earnings expectations are already low for AAPL.    AAPL reminds me of GOOGL this year when it was in similar situation of dumpster fire but then broke out after it finally worked out Gemini. AAPL already told you that it's going to make a push to AI, which should mean multiple expansion for AAPL stock. My guess is that in June we'll see Siri being totally revamped and actually be useful. Don't get me wrong this June WWDC event needs to be successful or this stock will stay dumpster fire. We need to see some sort of hype and the market needs to be convinced that that the next iphone will be a must-have due its new AI features. If there's anyone who can market the shit out of anything, it's AAPL.  The whole kitchen sink was thrown at AAPL recently. You have dissapointing product launch of its Vision Pro. You have the news about negative China sales. You have this big DOJ case come out of no where. You had an analyst downgrade yesterday. And even with all of that, it didn't make a new low from March 6th. Unless there's an unexpected market-wide correction, I can't see AAPL going lower this year.  This whole market recently has been a rotation trade. That is why the market has gone up even without AAPL and now without NVDA. The market has been broadening. It will continue to find laggards and re-allocate money from hot areas. AAPL is that obvious laggard right now and it needs to eventually participate for the market to continue signficiantly higher.

"2024 is google time";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/191iefv/2024_is_google_time/";"Disclaimer: This is not financial advice  Google (GOOG) is one of the most dominant and innovative companies in the world, with a market cap of over $1.7 trillion and a diverse portfolio of products and services. In this post, I will highlight some of the reasons why I am very bullish on Google and why I think it is a great long-term investment.  AI Drug Discovery  Isomorphic Labs,under Alphabet deepmind, has been working on a new AI drug development project with Eli Lilly and Novartis, which is worth $3 billion.  It is more than open ai last year revenue. It just insane. The AI profitability is not on chatbot but AI industry revolution.  Google’s AI drug development project with Eli Lilly and Novartis is a promising venture that could revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry. While the project is still in its early stages, it has the potential to develop new treatments for diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer’s. Investors should keep an eye on this project as it progresses.     Waymo  Waymo is Google's self-driving car subsidiary and one of the most advanced and ambitious projects in the autonomous vehicle industry. Waymo has been operating commercial robotaxi services in Phoenix, Arizona and San Francisco, California, with plans to expand to Los Angeles and Austin, Texas.   Waymo has a competitive edge over its rivals, such as Tesla, Uber, and Lyft, in terms of technology, data, and regulation. Waymo has logged over 20 million miles of real-world driving and over 20 billion miles of simulation, giving it a huge amount of data to train and improve its AI. Waymo also has a full-stack approach, developing its own hardware and software, and using fully electric vehicles powered by renewable energy. Waymo is also one of the few companies that have obtained regulatory approval to operate without safety drivers in the vehicle, making it the first company to offer a truly driverless service to the public.  Waymo has a huge potential to disrupt the transportation industry and create new revenue streams for Google. Waymo can offer a cheaper, safer, and more convenient alternative to traditional car ownership, ride-hailing, and public transit. Waymo can also leverage its technology to enter other markets, such as trucking, delivery, and logistics. Waymo is estimated to be worth over billions and could generate over $10 billion in annual revenue by 2030.   Gemini  Gemini is Google's newest and most ambitious AI project, aiming to create a general-purpose AI system that can understand and interact with any type of information. Gemini is built from the ground up for multimodality, meaning it can seamlessly reason across text, images, video, audio, and code. Gemini can also generate creative and innovative content, such as poems, stories, code, essays, songs, and more.   Gemini is a game-changer for Google and the world, as it can enable new possibilities and applications that were previously unimaginable. Gemini can enhance Google's existing products and services, such as Search, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, and more, by providing more accurate, relevant, and personalized results. Gemini can also create new products and services, such as education, entertainment, health, and more, by providing tailored and engaging experiences. Gemini can also empower users and developers, by allowing them to access, manipulate, and create any type of information with natural language and voice commands.   Conclusion  Google is a powerhouse of innovation and growth, with a strong track record of delivering value to its shareholders. Google has a clear vision and strategy to leverage its AI capabilities to create new drugs, new modes of transportation, and new ways of interacting with information. Google is well-positioned to capitalize on the massive opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in the 21st century. Google is not just a search engine, it is a global leader in AI and a pioneer in the future of humanity.   I am very bullish on Google and I think it is a must-have stock for any long-term investor. Google to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀.  Tldr 30-day 160 call  Their earning will smash it ";"73";"2024-01-08T11:41:29"

Apple and Google are in active negotiations to let the iPhone maker license Gemini, Google's set of generative AI models, to power some new features coming to the phone's software this year, Bloomberg said.

While AI names like NVIDIA have been surging, GOOGL share price has looked like absolute garbage. Why? Well, Google was getting really shitty for awhile, too worried about policing whether we call something a “motherboard” because its “sexist” or something equally stupid.

Get in losers, we’re going call shopping.  # Google will bomb your grandmother to lock in another $1B revenue  Have you heard of Project Nimbus? It’s a project to help Israeli military surveillance. Google is the biggest service provider helping out.  If you haven’t seen the video yet, here’s a Google Cloud Platform engineer protesting a Google Israel exec before getting physically removed by security while the crowd boos him  [https://twitter.com/car0linehaskins/status/1764681078206337434](https://twitter.com/car0linehaskins/status/1764681078206337434)  Now, I’m not a big fan of Israel and its slaughter of women and children in Gaza. But the point is that Google DGAF about that, they want to make bank. Google will help bomb your grandma’s house for a billion dollars, and if you bitch about it, they’ll literally put you in a chokehold and throw you out of the room. There are people like this guy inside Google protesting, but the show goes on… Google execs are happy to help and talk publicly about it.  It’s a fat check and morals be damned, Google is not going to let a little genocide get in the way of their revenue.  Does this sounds woke to you?  Well, there’s more on the anti-woke agenda…  # Google will fire your wife’s boyfriend to keep costs down  Google not only DGAF about supporting war criminals. Google will also flout labor laws and its perception to organized labor by laying off a division live on TV in order to send a message that their bloodthirsty profit-making will not be challenged.  Have you seen the video? Here’s Youtube employees testifying in front of Austin City Council getting laid off live on air. Google is not the woke mob. Google is for better or worse destroying the woke mob live for you to see it.  [https://twitter.com/peepaw\_/status/1763376791861735583](https://twitter.com/peepaw_/status/1763376791861735583)  This of course comes well after a series of large layoffs back at Google HQ. I live in the SF bay area and have several friends who were around at the time. Many of these “Xooglers” have speculated that Google management has detailed surveillance of employee activity, and used this data to prioritize who to get rid of.  Google developed a (well deserved) reputation in recent years of being a place where lazy social activists dicked around and burned cash. The stock performance reflects this. But things turned around over the past year or so, and Google has trimmed the fat aggressively. This will become obvious to markets soon.  Google isn’t a woke playground for slackers, it’s a bloodthirsty beast that will surveil staff to systematically remove the lazy, even firing your wife’s boyfriend on live television to send a message.  # Google’s founders are heads down on AI  One more video to make the point about the attitude of Google top brass.  Here’s a tweet from some idiot who doesn’t get it at all, posting a clip of Sergey Brin talking to a room of people including *the dude with the tits tshirt*. I don’t know about you, but I personally would not want to spend a minute in this room of total dorks.

The important thing is, he’s still out there working on Gemini, and even tolerating the horrible smell of incels to fix the shitty launch of Gemini’s public product. I don’t want some suits issuing press releases, I want the $1.7T market cap company founder still out there grinding.  Speaking of Gemini…  # Google Gemini will destroy OpenAI (and Micro$oft)  Forget about ChatGPT the product interface. The “woke” problem with the public release of Gemini is a small speedbump on the long road to AI supremacy. The real long-term value of AI will be how companies can incorporate LLMs into tasks across the spectrum of business needs.  *Have you heard of VertexAI?* It’s one of the tools available in the Google Cloud suite, and it makes it easy to use models for more than “just another chat bot.” VertexAI, powered by Gemini, already has surpassed OpenAI in functionality for varying business use cases.  Here’s an example. I work with a large multinational advertising company on data projects including AI use cases, and we’re using VertexAI. Take as an example this [functionality on “multimodal embeddings”](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings). You can pass it a few paragraphs of text, a few images, a few videos, and some audio recordings – and then easily use the resulting embeddings to do something like, “What is the most similar video to this paragraph?” This is the kind of stuff that real actual businesses will use to automate your job. **You probably won’t even be able to get a job at Wendy’s soon because of tools like this.**  We’re using VertexAI instead of OpenAI because the functionality simply doesn’t exist yet in OpenAI’s suite. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta’s Llama, etc. are all great models and are quickly becoming commoditized, but meanwhile Google is building business capabilities around the models that will push AI customers into their cloud suite and entire stack of products.  BTW, did you read the recently released [Elon letters to OpenAI](https://twitter.com/0interestrates/status/1765204521909887309)? In 2018 Elon was worried that Google would take over the world with their AI, including the DeepMind team which has arguably the best and highest paid AI staff in the world. Well, they haven’t disappeared, and Google is still probably going to take over the world.  But, Gemini and DeepMind aren’t the only Google assets relevant to the AI revolution.  # Google is the only company that can beat NVIDIA  Like NVIDIA, Google is also a “fabless chipmaker.” They make a device called a TPU which is like the GPUs built by NVIDIA except better for AI. They were specifically designed for AI use cases.  Do you like NVIDIA? You like stonks that go up, right? Well, NVIDIA’s GPUs are great, but the TPU produced by Google was especially made for AI use cases. Why aren’t more companies using them, you may ask? Read for yourself on [this Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39670121) \- Google’s not selling their TPUs except to a specific few [customers like Anthropic](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/google-announces-expansion-of-ai-partnership-with-anthropic-301981815.html), because their internal services (like VertexAI) are using near 100% of all the TPUs they’ve currently produced. The time is coming soon where Google’s TPU production will go beyond internal usage, but it hasn’t come yet because they’re too powerful to justify letting anyone else use them yet!  You can listen to this recent [Risk Biscuits podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/interview-15-doug-olaughlin-from-fabricated-knowledge/id1722170364?i=1000648424701) featuring Fabricated Knowledge’s Doug O’Laughlin, an expert on the semiconductor industry, where he calls out Google as one of the only companies that could soon eat NVIDIA’s lunch.  BTW, Anthropic are the people who made Claude 3 - check out their [demo of Claude being an economic analyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjL6Gl6ZIqs). **Yes, regards, your econ degree is useless now too, because of Google.**  # Google: the only company that owns the entire AI stack  God, this post is long, but it has to be because $GOOGL has a lot of shit to talk about to justify how it will print tendies for us. Let’s make this one quick.  Google is the one company that has the entire AI stack in-house. Let’s review  * **Hardware**: Google TPU is their own AI-specific hardware that will soon go head-to-head with NVIDIA * **Dev software**: They maintain TensorFlow, a tool for interacting at a low level with AI tech * **AI APIs**: VertexAI (as discussed) * **Infra**: Their Google Cloud Platform suite means customers can easily store, process, transform, and analyze data - seamlessly integrated with VertexAI and Gemini * **Data**: Google notoriously hoovers up a fuckton of data from all their products: Gmail, Search, Chrome to name a few. This is data they can use to easily train their models, data that competitors don’t have access to. * **Monetization**: **Ads**  Which brings us to the Golden Goose of Google, online advertising.  # Google: still untouchable king of online advertising  Google makes an assload of cash from online advertising. They’ve essentially created an ads monopoly, by buying up competitors in the programmatic display ad ecosystem, buying the highest-value Video ads publisher (Youtube), building the most popular email provider (Gmail), and of course, being by far the most popular search engine.  They’re well on the way to making it effortless to turn a dial and instantly spend $100m across every advertising channel with their PerformanceMax advertising system. It’s an AI-based (duh) system for using the advertiser’s data and website to automatically build and serve Text, Display, Video, Audio ads across their ads monopoly.  I was recently consulting with a large ecommerce brand. 85% of their ad spend was going to Google Shopping ads, because no matter how much they tested Bing, Meta, LinkedIn, etc., none of that shit worked like Google does. Google is the king.  **Do you want to advertise to people looking for the specific products you’re selling, or to people jerking off to autistic e-girls on their Instagram reels?** Hm, I wonder what performs better? Holy fuck.  # Google AI advertising: Coming to PerformanceMax campaigns near you  We’re almost done. The last point about AI + Ads is that there’s a whole new channel for advertising coming soon: Generative AI advertising.  Have you seen the little blurbs in Google Search results where Google uses AI to give answers to your search query? Obviously, soon enough, advertisers will pay to be directly injected into not just these blurbs, but all across the Gemini ecosystem.  Think about it- You are Coca Cola. You spend $100m on Google to buy AI generation impressions. Now when Gemini creates text about people being thirsty or drinking something, CocaCola gets inserted into the response. **These responses go out not just through the Google search page but also through the VertexAI API calls that businesses are using across all \*their\* AI use cases**. Better yet, PerformanceMax will automatically allocate budget to this new AI advertising and track the performance of it along with all the rest of the ridiculous ad spend you’re pushing through Google Ads. This hasn’t been announced yet, but the writing is on the wall (or in the AI, or something). Will it be next earnings release? Not sure.  # Google price is being held down by calls expiring this Friday  Well, all this sounds great - but besides all the anti-wokeness pressure on the stock, why now?  You regards hopefully know about Cem Karsan and his options market expertise – if not then you should probably give up or just buy GOOGL calls and call it a day.  Last week on this [Top Traders Unplugged podcast](https://www.toptradersunplugged.com/podcast/285-systematic-investor-series-ft-cem-karsan-march-2nd-2024/) Cem talked about how we’re coming into a huge options expiry this Friday for the single name options. There’s a large amount of open interest on big NASDAQ names like GOOGL that are suppressing stock price. As the OTM short calls held by MM’s get close to expiry, the delta decays, meaning the MM’s need to sell the underlying in order to stay hedged. While the AI names have been on a tear for the past month, the rest of the Mag7 has suffered because of this dynamic.  Well, Friday’s coming quickly. Will the lid come off so the non-NVIDIA Mag7 can return to greatness? Will the market realize that Google is a take-no-prisoners money printing machine who has systematically removed woke slackers from their ranks over the past year? We will see.  # Google go up becus Jeo Boden  https://preview.redd.it/m4ljfncqgtnc1.png?width=1704&format=png&auto=webp&s=074a852664ba33a4a9c60f2368099712faaeacbf  Finally, in case you’re living under a rock, it’s worth reminding you that it’s an election year and Powell won’t be able to close the fucking door for long if he gets fired by Doland Tremp next year.

"Google, Amazon, and Unity are among the tech companies implementing layoffs to start 2024";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/196i3fc/google_amazon_and_unity_are_among_the_tech/";"Google, Amazon, and Unity are among the tech companies implementing layoffs to start 2024, echoing trends observed in 2023. Tech firms persist in cost-cutting, efficiency improvement, and adapting to a cooling labor market. The U.S. unemployment rate stands at 3.7%, a near 50-year low, yet recent months have seen a slowdown in job gains. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employers added 105,000 workers in October, 173,000 in November, and 216,000 in December, below the 2023 monthly average of 225,000.   Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) confirmed on Thursday that it is laying off hundreds of staff across its voice assistant, hardware, and engineering teams. A Google spokesperson mentioned organizational changes, including role eliminations globally, aligning with product priorities.  Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman are reportedly leaving the company after Google's $2.1B acquisition in 2021, amidst competition with the Apple (AAPL) Watch. Alphabet also made several cuts in 2023, including an announcement in January to eliminate roughly 12,000 jobs.  Unity Software (NYSE:U) announced a 25% staff cut this week, aiming to restructure and refocus its core business for long-term and profitable growth. Approximately 1,800 employees are impacted, with the company unable to reasonably estimate costs associated with the reduction until the first quarter of 2024. Despite revenue growth, Unity has struggled to turn a profit, leading to a 20% decline in shares over the past six months.  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to cut several hundred employees in its media units, including Prime Video and MGM Studios. Reports suggest a 35% reduction in the Twitch workforce, affecting around 500 workers, and a 5% cut in the Audible workforce. Like tech counterpart Alphabet, Amazon made various employment cuts in the previous year.  Xerox (NASDAQ:XRX) announced a 15% reduction in its workforce in the first quarter of this year as part of a restructuring plan. The plan focuses on improving and stabilizing the core print business, increasing productivity through a new Global Business Services organization, and directing Digital Services and IT Services capabilities towards more profitable markets. This restructuring follows a 6% year-over-year decline in third-quarter sales.";"333";"2024-01-14T16:16:45"

"Google - The AI Juggernaut Poised to Explode";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/193f1u3/google_the_ai_juggernaut_poised_to_explode/";"   Hey degen,  I'm super bullish on Google (Alphabet Inc., $GOOG) and I'll tell you why. Google is a dominant player in AI, and their AI fleet is just insane. They're killing it in every aspect of artificial intelligence, and if you're not paying attention, you're missing out on potentially massive gains.  Let me break it down for you:  1. AI Drug Discovery: Google's DeepMind is revolutionizing the pharmaceutical industry with its AI-powered drug discovery platform. They've already made $3 billion in 2024, and this is just the beginning. Imagine the potential for growth in this sector alone. 2. AI Phone: Google's Pixel lineup is already a strong contender in the smartphone market, but with their AI capabilities, they're poised to take it to the next level. Expect their market share to grow and bring in more revenue. 3. AI Chatbot Gemini: Google's AI chatbot is giving other chatbots a run for their money. With its advanced natural language processing and understanding, it's set to become the go-to chatbot for businesses and consumers alike. 4. AI Robotics: Google's investments in robotics, such as RT2, are paying off. As robotics become more integrated into our daily lives, Google stands to benefit immensely. 5. AI Self-Driving Cars: Google's Waymo is leading the charge in autonomous vehicles. With regulatory approvals and partnerships in place, they're ready to disrupt the transportation industry and rake in the profits. 6. AI TPU Chips: Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are custom-built for machine learning tasks. As more companies adopt AI, demand for these chips will skyrocket, further boosting Google's bottom line.  If Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) can bring its valuation to $1 trillion, then Google's combined AI efforts in drug discovery, chatbot, robotics, and autonomous driving could easily be worth $4 trillion at least.  And that's not even considering their dominance in search, advertising, and other sectors.  TL:DR: $GOOG is a sleeping giant in the AI space. With their unparalleled AI capabilities and diverse product offerings, they're set to explode in value. Don't miss out on this opportunity to invest in the future of technology. BALL Deep for their earning.  Disclaimer: I'm just a ape, not a financial advisor. Do your own research and make your own investment decisions. But seriously, buy $GOOG. 🚀💰🦍  Edit: Thanks for the support, fellow degenerates! Let's ride this AI rocketship to the moon! 🌕🚀💰🦍";"40";"2024-01-10T19:20:25"

Googles AI alone will replace many jobs in every sector. Monetization plans are in place, so they know how to print $$ off of this.  I am a PhD student with not a lot of money. But, my private monthly expenses for google products are only going and I've been using Gemini with the free trial for work, it's nice. Not as good as GPT-4, but close.

"The Big Bet: Going Bullish on Google and Bearish on Microsoft";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1b6jrtu/the_big_bet_going_bullish_on_google_and_bearish/";"Hey fellow degenerates,  I’m contemplating a bold move and would love to get your takes. I’m eyeing Google ($GOOGL) for a bullish play with Call options and Microsoft ($MSFT) for a bearish stance through Put options.  Here’s my rationale:  Google ($GOOGL) Calls: Despite recent flak over Gemini, their new but controversial LLM, I’m betting on Google’s comeback. The uproar was over Gemini producing some, let’s say, “creative” outputs (think: Pope imagery gone wild). Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founder, stepped out of his semi-retirement to steer the ship right, signaling a serious clean-up and commitment to excellence. Given Google’s unmatched data access (YouTube, Reddit data deals), I believe they’re uniquely positioned to refine and dominate the LLM space. This fiasco, while a setback, could be the wake-up call needed to spur significant positive changes, making Google a stronger contender in the AI race, especially against the backdrop of OpenAI and ChatGPT shaking up the traditional search model. “Why search when you can find?” - LLMs might just be the answer, and Google’s poised to capitalize on this paradigm shift.  Microsoft ($MSFT) Puts: On the flip side, I’m skeptical about Microsoft’s current trajectory. Copilot, their latest foray into AI, seems more gimmick than game-changer based on user feedback and practical utility. Beyond Teams and Copilot, I’m hard-pressed to find compelling innovations that could drive Microsoft’s value higher. The market’s enthusiasm for Microsoft, especially following its rally post-Nvidia, feels overblown. I suspect their AI offerings won’t be enough to sustain their recent growth, making them a prime candidate for a bearish bet.  So, I’m all in on Google thriving through its AI pivot and Microsoft facing headwinds with its AI initiatives. But, what do you think? Am I missing anything critical about Google’s prospects or overlooking potential upside in Microsoft’s strategy?  Change my mind or back me up, but either way, let’s hear those hot takes!";"23";"2024-03-04T20:29:15"
"$DXCM and Google";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bh2pvn/dxcm_and_google/";"Hey boys and ladies,     I bought into DexCom (200 shares at $136.80) after the company got their FDA approval for an over-the-counter continuous glucose monitor called Stelo. I thought this is a cool product that fitness geeks and diabetes people will all like. I would never use it, but it's cool if other people use it.  I noticed in some articles that Google is a big investor in DexCom. I checked Google's most recent 13F and the company is currently holding 3,681,885 shares at a value of $456,885,110. The shares held by Google have continuously increased over the past few months. Not a ton of money for Google, but I wonder what Google is doing with these holdings? I saw news that they partnered with them a while back for health apps and whatnot, but what other purpose is there?   One conspiracy theory that I thought of is that the USA is basically a population of pre-diabetic fat asses. Regular people will use this over-the-counter product and connect it to their Google account, then Google will have access to lots of people's actual blood glucose levels in real-time, which it could analyze to understand when people would be pissed and upset and have less overall tolerance for things when they have low-blood-sugar and feel better when they have higher blood sugar.  For instance, my wife and I just got into an argument about how she hates where we live and hates our children's school and wants to move to a new place. Turns out she was just hungry. Google can use this data for premium targeted ads that are timed for when you have low blood sugar (snickers, your not you when your hungry) or even sell this data to pharma companies that will convince you in a timely way that you suffer from anxiety or depression and that you need to be on medicine for the rest of your life to be normal but really you just needed to eat a banana.   The missing piece for me is what's in it for DexCom? Do they make any money on this?  My point here is that I'm thinking of putting more money into this company.  The recent dip makes me think bag holders got out on the gap up and now the stock is consolidating but the high PE makes me think I make a mistake. Throw in your 2 cents.";"13";"2024-03-17T18:08:57"

The company provides businesses with marketing and customer service software.  **Company Synergies:** Many corporations track their SEO and Google Analytics data through HubSpot to see how well their site and the blogs or articles within it are performing over time, so the synergies are definitely present between the two companies.   **Potential Implications:** Alphabet must be careful as it has faced some major antitrust scrutiny over the past year.  * The U.S. Department of Justice recently filed its second antitrust suit against Google’s ad business. * The first antitrust lawsuit, filed in October 2020, accused Google of unlawfully obtaining a monopoly in the search market.  To make sure no antitrust issues come about this time around, Alphabet is making sure to consult with its financial partner, Morgan Stanley, first before making a potential offer.   Under the Biden administration, technology conglomerates have found it difficult to pursue mega deals that could cause unfair monopolistic competitive advantages in the industry.  **Bottom line:** If the acquisition were to go through, it would be the largest in Alphabets history and allow for its mega pile of cash to be put to use, currently at $110.9 billion as of the end of December[om here](https://www.blackswanstreet.com/subscribe)";"10";"2024-04-05T21:21:41"

I know the consensus is that Reddit is a garbage platform riddled with bots, an incompetent CEO who changes negative comments about him on the platform himself, and a bunch of power-hungry mods to keep it all under ''control'' as much as you can keep raging wildfire under control. I agree with all of this, and all of this makes me want to short this stock into oblivion as well.   I have one problem with shorting, and that's Google's and Reddit's newfound love story. As we all know in February Reddit and Google struck a deal that means Google can use all of Reddit's content tot train its AI for $60 million per year. Again, garbage deal-making on the side of Reddit, what's $60 million a year really these days? Anyway, that's not my point.   My point is what this means for Reddit traffic. Below you can see their traffic fucking skyrocketed in the past months. Coincidence? If you think Google accidentally redirects 100s of millions of users a month to Reddit, you're on an LSD trip. It's because this benefits Google (more users = more user-generated content = more data to train AI).   For Reddit, 8 times the amount of users means 8 times the amount of ad revenue. Honestly, I know they're incompetent over here, but you'd have to be very highly regarded to not make money out of that. Hell, even if they did nothing at all, they're likely to make metric fuck tons of ad revenue from this.   I know we just had a guy talk about buying/shorting stock based on web traffic (and another regard that lost money based on that tactic) but in terms of scale this is completely in its own league. Is this a buy?  Probably still shorting though.

The organic web traffic on [sentinelone.com](https://sentinelone.com) has increased in the last 6 months from 129 thousand to 191 thousand per day, which is about +47%.

Apple has been slower in rolling out generative AI, which can generate human-like responses to written prompts, than rivals Microsoft and Google, which are weaving them into products.Last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook [said](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-shareholders-reject-ai-disclosure-proposal-2024-02-28/) the company plans to disclose later this year more about its plans to put generative AI to use, adding that the company is investing ""significantly"" in the area.";"50";"2024-03-18T07:39:43"

For those who are new to Google somehow, that's the deal: in 2018, WSJ reported that Google found a ""glitch"" in Google+ earlier that year, which affecting data security. Between 2015 and March 2018, this glitch allowed outside developers access to almost 500k (!!) users personal data.  And despite discovering this issues in March 2018, Google didn't inform anybody about that to avoid regulatory issues. Simply - they didn't want ""problems with regulators which can affect their reputation"" as they said.  They were hit with may suits due to this, and finally they [resolved with $350M](https://11thestate.com/cases/alphabet-investor-settlement) the one for the investors over stock drops, so if you invested in Google you can check it I guess.  Actually, I think that Google+ was over even back then, in precovid times, they didn't have any features which weren't improved by others already and in mooore handy way. So, they didn't even have a chance to compete with any other platforms so it was kinda predetermined for them. And it's good that they are paying at least something due to this fuck up and also I think their partnership with Apple seems pretty logic at this point lol.";"36";"2024-03-19T16:26:10"
"Is HubSpot a Buy After Google Acquisition Talks?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwnlsi/is_hubspot_a_buy_after_google_acquisition_talks/";"HubSpot, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had a market cap of around $32 billion before the news was leaked by Reuters. The company provides businesses with marketing and customer service software.  Many corporations track their SEO and Google Analytics data through HubSpot to see how well their site and the blogs or articles within it are performing over time, so the synergies are definitely present between the two companies.   However, Alphabet must be **careful** as big tech companies have faced major antitrust scrutiny over the past year.  The U.S. Department of Justice recently filed its second antitrust suit against Google’s ad business. The first antitrust lawsuit, filed in October 2020, accused Google of unlawfully obtaining a monopoly in the search market.  To make sure no antitrust issues come about this time around, Alphabet is making sure to consult with its financial partner, Morgan Stanley, first before making a potential offer. Under the Biden administration, technology conglomerates have found it **difficult** to pursue mega deals that could cause unfair monopolistic competitive advantages in the industry.  Is there a potential long-term play for HubSpot?";"0";"2024-04-05T19:19:01"

The ship sailed a generation ago since Kaiser Permanente has been doing the same thing UNH is with Optum forever. Good luck trying to un-fuk the US healthcare system. To really drive this home, so far UNH has spent $10mm+ lobbying (top 50) and while DOJ is not congress, let's not pretend congress doesn't put pressure on the DOJ.  Good luck trying to un-fuk the US healthcare system.  This thing has been a beast of a compounder for a decade that has silently performed better than GOOG/GOOGL since March of 2014 (10 year total returns), returning 21.5% annualized vs 18.5% for GOOG - with way less volatility (this means options are cheap for those who can't connect the dots).  UNH is trading at \~15x NTM FCF, a discount to \~20x NTM FCF it has traded historically over last 5 years.   For those who don't care about FCF, trading at 17x NTM PE while market is trading at 23x+ NTM PE.  This thing likely rerates to 20x NTM FCF in 12 months if not sooner and with $34 of FCF/Share by end of 2025 we are talking about $650+ stock within 12-16 months.

Hi, I am the ARM guy with a position in ARM, Google, MSFT and 1 share of Apple to see what it does (:)   [It looks here that Google has reversed course to play nice with Windows ARM.](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24051485/google-chrome-windows-arm-support-canary-channel-test) The reasons for this are related to AI because if users have to use native Edge to get any useful AI experience when the onslaught of Windows on Arm devices start to roll out Chrome would have been at a severe disadvantage.   In a way, Chrome had to do this.   The implications are huge here. Google, in effect, is saying our AD business is more important than our Chromebook business. Microsoft will be able to roll out more cheaper and battery efficient Windows devices as a result effectively taking Chromebook notion off of the table. That last part is just how I see it but it makes sense.   Even more than that AI will be so integral to the OS that the only way Google can hope to fight back is with Chrome so that is probably another additive reason of why this makes sense.

Nvidia, Google, Apple * Who can produce the required chips at scale? TSMC * Who builds the machines to produce these chips? ASML * If LLM inference was further optimized to not require state of the art accelerator chips, who else could supply? Intel, Samsung, GlobalFoundries  **Time for some hedge fund level deep market analysis:**  https://preview.redd.it/f3rvkz0eecjc1.png?width=1339&format=png&auto=webp&s=31584d759387cd8b19ee3f0e7ed30edb4dd0b5e1  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/4mqstz7kecjc1.png?width=462&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bd44cfca1cca5449872c7095bd88e0e604e8ff7  What stands out:  * We have multiple companies competing at the IP level and the Nvidia train already left the station - next stop bagholding town * We only have one dominant producer (TSMC) and enabler (ASML) * Alternative enablers and producers are not discounted  With competition at the IP level, the real gatekeepers are the producer (short term) and enabler (mid term). They can dictate prices, especially given the expectation pressure and demand the key IP companies have.  **TSMC is offered at a massive discount compared to the rest of the market.**  Now you will say that's because of Geopolitical risk.  Right. But what if China actually attacks Taiwan? What if TSMC must stop production?  All of the IP companies will be royally skrewed. The US momentum on AI will be severely slowed down.  So 1) every single IP company above is exposed to the same risk re/ AI - especially Nvidia, and 2) the USA is highly invested in protecting Taiwan's production capabilities.  China has economical issues. They are again trying to increase trade with the USA. They are even trying to take a peacemaker role (see MSC). Going for Taiwan would be too expensive, maybe even detrimental to their economy. IMHO the likelihood is now at a new low.  **That leaves TSMC priced at a \~50% discount.**  Fellow wendy workers, we have an opportunity to go beyond YOLO-ing again. Who's in?

You regards realize that this doesn’t just have implications for Google but will most likely seriously fuck up Apple too if the deal between them to default Google as a search engine is ruled as anticompetitive?  Apple nets $10-$20 BILLION a year just from setting Google as a default on devices and its browsers, and even if the district court doesn’t go nuclear and void the agreement, kneecapping Apple’s profits back to the stone age, it could demand that Apple pay out some or all of the money earned through that deal to competing search engines.   Sure guys, Apple will still be Apple, and the technocrats in the courts will continue to suck off corporations, but it’s not like there isn’t precedent for Antitrust even if it’s been a while since such a high profile case.

She sent me a pic of her account and true to her word, 2k gain today.  Anyway, she wants to guide me through some of her trading strats over the next few days. I'm gonna try and get her to give me options tips, and lets face it, I lost 98% last year so if she wants to scam the final 2% out of me, she's fuckin welcome to it.   She's literally gonna be my quant and i'm gonna change my name to deepasianvalue when I rinse the market.  You fools are listening to clowns like cramer and uncle fuckin bruce while watching cnbc, and I'm literally working on math geniuses using dating apps. SEC can't touch that shit.   ## Edit  Ok guys, I'll keep you updated tomorrow because I need to go to sleep now but I wanna address some of the replies:  1 - I don't think it's some sort of visa scam. I'm in bongland and basically anyone can come to this country and the government doesn't give a shit. On top of that, she said she was born here and is a citizen so doesnt need my marriage for paperwork   2 - I'm gonna get her to post a pic with my name written down on it or something to prove she's not a fat old man. No idea how to approach this. I'm also bullish on the fact she wants to video chat and this was her suggestion. No dick pics will be sent so she cant blackmail me  3 - People have said they invite you onto an exchange, give you a couple of wins then take everything when you roll big. That's fine. I'll take those cheap easy small wins, it'll be more than I win on my own *and* after those easy wins I'll block and move onto the next one. It's like getting a free $50 at the casino for signing up, spend it, then get out onto the strip and move onto the next one. This is like an uno reverse on a scammer. Pfft, poohbear thinks his scammers can outfox a guy who gets advice from wsb and lost £14,000 last year on pennystocks? He's met his match.   4 - You have to accept that there *might* just be some intelligent quant asian girl out there who constantly gets mugged off and blocked for being a scammer. Imagine how hard it is being a pretty asian girl on a dating site, knowing everyone thinks you're a scammer. I'm willing to give her a chance. Ride or die, I either end up in the gutter or live a life of luxury with the waifu, mocking all you regards as we powerslide into the airport in our lambo for our private jet vacation to Japan or something.   She could be my senpai.  LFG.";"1959";"2024-01-29T21:07:03"

"GRND: Gamble on the Gays";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/14ebqzv/grnd_gamble_on_the_gays/";"   Alright WSB. So I (for research purposes) decided to download Grindr and immediately got like 15x as many matches as I did on Tinder. This made me realize that Grindr is probably making HELLA tendies from these insanely active users.   It turns out I was right, and GRND is set up for insane growth and $$ in the future.  Now I will make this shit short because you all have an attention span shorter than a cocaine crazed monkey. (If you want more information, here's a ton of info I collected about the company[ https://docs.google.com/document/d/14PLrTHYfY3Hz\_udhv2DrDCgGNqeAkdJk7HbvjLLTUh4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14PLrTHYfY3Hz_udhv2DrDCgGNqeAkdJk7HbvjLLTUh4/edit?usp=sharing)) \*WARNING, there are no crayon pictures -- so if you can't read don't click the link     **Thesis:**  * Americans are lonelier, hornier, and gayer than ever, and who will benefit from that? Grindr! * GRND has a large and growing monetizable user base * Solid fundamentals with rapidly increasing Revenue and EBITDA * Low IV and Beta * 94.8% of shares are not publicly traded  For those of you who wanna actually “invest” (or atleast buy Leaps), I’ll give you the long-term play first. For the rest of you who just wanna YOLO on Weeklies, the short-term play is further below.   **Long-Term:**  Loneliness rates in America are rising at a rapid pace, with each subsequent generation more lonely than the last  https://preview.redd.it/g13xnibdh67b1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=4509902f369114f252a1169c5dc24d551ce5e337  This is set to continue as technology makes us more disconnected. This sounds sad, but guess what we can do from this? GET FUCKING RICH!  Because of this, online dating apps are increasing insanely fast. A lot of lonely people (especially redditors), will pay insane amounts of money for the chance to date or have sex.  In addition to this, younger generations are MUCH more likely to identify as LGBT+  https://preview.redd.it/3v1rg9wdh67b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d241bb36f92bb59658785f376280b164228002cb  This sets up GRND in a PERFECT position. Growing loneliness and growing gayness. And they have capitalized on this, with now over 13 million monthly active users  And luckily for Grindr, 90% of their revenue comes from subscriptions. This means any potential economic slowdown won't impact them nearly as much as their competitors who rely more on ads.  In addition to this, the fundamentals are solid  1. The company has positive FCF and rapidly growing EBITDA meaning GRND likely won’t need to raise more capital 2. EBITDA is growing MUCH faster than revenue - meaning this company will be a cash flow machine! 3. Revenue is still growing fast and is projected to continue like that for some time 4. Their Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) is almost 2x as high as their competitors such as Bumble and 1.5x higher than Match Group 5. Their Cost of Revenue is decreasing over time while their Gross Profit is growing at 35%+ 6. Their assets are growing faster than their liabilities  These numbers are crazy good, especially considering these are Y/Y numbers that were likely inflated by COVID and lonely people in lockdown with a ton of $$ and time to spend.  Now I spent 10 hours digging deeper into the filings and found a fuck ton of good numbers - but that is kinda boring so if u have questions and wanna see info just comment or go to the google doc pasted above.  For those with gambling addictions, here is the short term play     **Short Term:**  GRND’s public float is ONLY 5.2% of outstanding shares, with the rest being held by insiders and institutions.  https://preview.redd.it/ygz92g2fh67b1.png?width=407&format=png&auto=webp&s=d64003a6c8cb125939fd1059995efc6fcaccc4f9  What this means is any buying pressure has a MASSIVE impact on share prices. Like I am talking about a bigger impact than when your wife’s boyfriend pounds her.  In addition, 72.5% of the shares CAN’T even be sold!  https://preview.redd.it/j3f2pdmfh67b1.png?width=1437&format=png&auto=webp&s=54e0c58190d2e6020206c5a90c6c09625753ec67  What makes this play EVEN better is the fact that GRND has a Beta of 0.13 (basically 9x less volatile than the s&p). You might be thinking “BORING”, but you are wrong. Options are now incredibly cheap!  This is essentially the best time in history to buy call options cause of the low IV. Basically with any positive news or catalyst, this stock is set to EXPLODE.

I can't think of a person leaving a company and just decimating the competition on the way out while blessing his former employer with the highest praise.  He's saying there is no chance in hell for others to catch up and not anytime soon.  I don't know if this is news but it should be. He's effectively saying AMD, Intel and whoever the hell else is thinking about their own chips just forget about it.  Here is why I believe the same thing. Claude Opus which is almost comparable to GPT 4 allows you to have 40 messages a day. That is just dire and completely inadequate for any real workload. And the responses come back in moments compared to GPT.  GPT5 is almost here and I don't think the world is ready for what that is going to be. Sora is already insanely ridiculous with Google's AI Chief, Demis Hassabis, and I quote, "" it could be difficult for Google to draw level with OpenAI's Sora."" And that's ALL GPU's folks.

My dad buys terrible companies regularly, and gets it wrong about the Mag 7. If you are betting against Netflix stock, your funds are not SAFU.   On another note, Evercore ISI has also released a pessimistic outlook on Netflix being unable to exceed investor expectations for core subscriber count.

AI is the internet plus the ability to reason and analyze anything you give it in fractions of a second. A new unequivocal boomstick to whomever wants to use it.  The true winners will be those startups in fields such as robotics, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, space-aeronautics, aviation, protein synthesis, new materials and so, so much more who will use AI in new and exciting ways.  Boston dynamics, set to boom. Self-driving robotaxis, set to boom. Flying taxis, set to boom. Job replacement/automation for legacy industry jobs white collar, set to boom. Personal AI agents for your individual workloads, booming. Healthcare change as we know it (doctors won't like this but too bad), set to boom.  The amount of industry that is set to shift and mutate and emerge from AI in the next 3 - 5 years will be astonishing.  I can tell you, standing on principal, that OpenAI's next release will be so game changing that nobody will deny where AI is heading. There is not a rock you can hide under to be so oblivious as to not see where this is going.  The reason why I bring up the next iteration of ChatGPT, GPT5, is because they are initiators of this phenomenon. Other, such as Google (and others) are furiously trying to catch up but as of today the 'MOAT' may be upon us.  The reason to believe that one may catch up (or try like hell to) is from the amount of compute power from GPU's it takes to train an ungodly amount of data. Trillions of data points. Billions (soon to be Trillions) of parameters all simulating that of the synaptic neuron connections in which the human brain functions that in turn gives us the spark of life and consciousness. Make no mistake, these guys are living out a present day Manhattan project.  These people are trying to build consciousness agency with the all the world's information as a reference document at it's finger tips. Today.  And guess what. The only way these guys can build that thing - That AGI/ASI/GAI reality - Is through Nvidia.  These guys believe and have tested that if you throw MORE compute at the problem it actually GAINS function. More compute equals more consciousness. That's what these people believe and they're attempting it.  Here, let me show you what I mean. What the graph below shows is that over time the amount of data and parameters that are being used to train an AI model. I implore you to watch this video as it is a great easy to understand educational video into what the hell is going on with all of this AI stuff. It's a little technical but very informative and there are varying opinions. I pulled out the very best part in relation to Nvidia here. [AI: Grappling with a New Kind of Intelligence](https://youtu.be/EGDG3hgPNp8?si=L71CUbmqho3jhKEh&t=3768)  https://preview.redd.it/vk5twc041hic1.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3d2bdf42cf25e1c04e940b2f61d0219871f2334  It's SO RIDICULOUS that you wouldn't be able to continue to see the beginning so they have to use a log plot chart. And as you see we are heading into Trillions of parameters. For reference GPT-4 was trained on roughly 200 billion parameters.  https://preview.redd.it/6cq17n5i1hic1.png?width=1327&format=png&auto=webp&s=830334aa7cdaddfa10d7f6512d10025f136076ed  It is estimated GPT-5 will be trained with 2-5 trillion parameters.  Sam Altman was dead ass serious when he is inquiring about obtaining $7 trillion for chip development. They believe that with enough compute they can create GOD.  So what's the response from Google, Meta and others. Well, they're forming ""AI """"Alliances"""""". Along with that they are going to and buying from the largest AI arms dealer on earth: Nvidia.  Nvidia is a common day AI Industrial Complex War machine.  **Sovereign AI with AI Foundries**  It's not just companies that are looking to compete it's also entire Nation States. Remember, when Italy banned GPT. Well, it turns out, countries don't want the United States building and implementing their AI into other country's culture and way of life.  So as of today, you have a battle of not just corporate America but entire countries looking to buy the bullets, tanks and missiles needed for this AI fight. Nvidia sells the absolute best bullets, the best guns, the best ammo one needs to attempt to create their own AI epicenters.  And it's so important that it is a national security risk to not just us the United States but to be a nation and not have the capability of AI.  Remember the leak about Q\* and a certain encryption being undone. You don't think heads of State where listening to that. Whether it was true or not it is now an imperative that you get with AI or get left behind. That goes just as much for a nation as it does for you as an individual.  When asked about the risk of losing out sales to China on Nvidia's last earnings call Jensen Huang clearly stated he was not worried about it because literally nations are coming online to build AI foundries.  **Nvidia's Numbers and The Power Of Compounding**  The power of compounding and why I think there share price is where it is today and has so much more room to grow. Let me ask you a question but first let me say that AWS's annual revenues are at \~$80/Y Billion. How long do you think with Nvidia's revenues of \~$18/Q Billion to reach or eclipse AWS at a 250% growth rate?  15 years? 10 Years? 5 years? Answer: 1.19 years. Ok let's not be ridiculous perhaps it's 200% instead.  5 years? Nope. 1.35 years.  Let's say they have a bad quarter and Italy doesn't pay up. 150%  5 years right? Nope. 1.62 years.  Come on they can't keep this up. 100%.  has to be 5 years this time. Nope. 2.15 years.  100% growth/2.15 years to 250% growth/1.19 years to reach 80 billion in annual revenues.  They're growth last year was 281%.  So wait, I wasn't being fair. I used $80 billion for AWS while their revenues last year where $88 Billion and Nvidia's last years 4 quarters where \~$33 Billion.  Here are those growth numbers it would take Nvidia to reach $88 billion.  At 279% =  0.73 years  At 250% = 0.78 years  At 200% = 0.89 years  at 100% = 1.41 years  Folks. That's JUST the data center. They are poised to surpass AWS, Azure and Google Cloud in about .73 to 1.5 years. Yes, you heard that right, your daddy's cloud company is about to be overtaken by your son's gaming GPU company.

"Intel DD - Underbought and Oversold: Why You Should Be Investing In The AI Revolution's Cheapest Stock";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c2ff3r/intel_dd_underbought_and_oversold_why_you_should/";"It's 2024 and Intel has not exactly performed admirably. While its competitors - AMD and NVIDA - have hit the moon and then some, Intel is still struggling along at around the price that it was prior to anyone knowing what ChatGPT was. If anyone had the massive foresight to invest in a chipmaker on the eve of the explosion in AI hype, they'd have been wrong to choose Intel. Problematic!  There are reasons for this, of course. Intel has not come out with a cutting-edge product - Nvidia's H100 has blown anything Intel's been able to offer out of the water. Intel has a notoriously dysfunctional corporate structure. Intel has been, since way before this subreddit existed, known for being a limp stock that trading sideways. China has been making noises about phasing out foreign chips. All these factors have prevented Intel from achieving the sort of green candlesticks that AMD and Nvidia sprouted as the implications of AI - and the vital role GPUs would play in powering it - became clear.  In spite of all this, I think Intel is a strong buy right now. Why?  For one, it's at a price we haven't seen in nearly a year. There's been a string of bad - but not structurally undermining - news coming out about the company recently, similar in form to the Gemini debacle that brought Google down to 133 a month ago. Google is now at 160, because AI is a hell of a thing to have in your column. The same dynamic is going to push Intel's price up. If you want that in technical analytic terms - RSI is below 30. Buy.  Intel is also catching up. [It's releasing a chip](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intels-artificial-intelligence-ai-chip-085500073.html) that can beat the H100! That's not the whole story, of course - there's rumors that NVDA's latest Blackwell offering will be better than Intel's when they release it later this year. But demand for AI and the chips that power it is only spiking. We're even starting to see LLMs that can operate locally at the consumer level, which requires a lot of hardware. Nvidia's already selling out for years in advance - people aren't going to be able to get their hands on the most cutting-edge chips for a long, long time. And so Intel is going to end up with a shitload of demand in its lap.   There's also the national security angle. Intel is the only major domestic chipmaker, and America has a considerable interest in ensuring that its domestic chipmaking capabilities are at least on par with other countries. Congress has already passed billions of dollars to domestic chipmaking efforts, and Intel will be a major beneficiary as it continues to dispense cash.   Their earnings call is on 4/25, and so [here's my 4/26 call spread](https://imgur.com/a/kNWdyfT). I expect these to pick up a lot of IV as we get closer to 4/25.

Allegedly   But for real. Reddit is the 3rd most visited website in the United States. It's market cap is only at $7 billion. CAVA, a company that sells albeit, pretty good mediterranean food bowls, has a market cap of $8 billion.     Why is Reddit worth so little, when similar companies like Pinterest and Twitter are worth 5X that?   Because they haven't historically advertised as well or as much, and don't have other successful cash generating products like premium accounts and marketplace platforms.     How much of the traffic is bots?   Let's gamble and find out.     What's the upside?  1. There's so little downside to taking the risk. The company's not going to drop that much below it's current market cap.  2. The company is easily one of the most influential platforms for the foreseeable future. The opportunity to build cash generating products on top of it are endless.  3. Google search engine recently updated it's algorithm to promote user generated counted, increasing Reddit's traffic exponentially.      What's the downside?  The only thing I don't like is that Reddit's Executive Team owns a large majority of shares. I think this will be a barrier for allowing Reddit to innovate and monetize.

"Snowflake isn't worth $50 Billion Dollars";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cirikp/snowflake_isnt_worth_50_billion_dollars/";"THESIS: The issue with snowflake is that they’re a distributed data warehouse, not a distributed compute framework.   However, distributed compute frameworks are more useful for complex “data science” tasks because most data needs to be ‘engineered’ before interesting analysis/machine learning can occur.  This post explores the idea that Snowflake is intentionally misleading investors by obfuscating the concrete services that they offer:  - Snowflake DOES NOT offer a general purpose ‘distributed computing framework’ or ‘distributed compute runtime’. - Snowflake SHOULD NOT be compared to ‘spark’ in benchmarks - Snowflake DOES NOT (physically) store your data     - subtext: storing data in cloud object store is trivial      THE EVIDENCE/ANALYSIS I PROVIDE IS BASED OFF OF:  - ~~- Carnegie Professor Andy Pavlo’s Snowflake lectures from his Advanced DB series~~   - My opinions about misrepresented features that have limited real world utility - Misleading promotional information for investors - My (limited) experience using the product - Lack of substantive online discourse(Reddit, Youtube)  DISCLOSURE:   - I’ve held a long short position(<$8k) since ~December which I rolled over into a different long short position after the CEO resigned. Imo, the CEO resigning in February is worse in the long run for my position because it was a good business move.  - FWIW, I don’t hold individual stocks: my entire portfolio is just VTI and this small amount of Snowflake puts.  - I am a Software Engineer and I used Snowflake for a short period at work.  MY CLAIMS:   - Snowflake's differentiated utility is confusing to the lay investor, industry, and their own customers - Snowflake’s valuation should be closer to Vercel’s, in $5 - $10 billion range.

The 3 variables I was most interested in measuring were:  * The correlation between any two stocks * The slope of the regression line between the stock ratio (Stock 1 / Stock 2) v.s. the amount of elapse time * The current ratio between two stocks versus their average ratio over a given time frame (I called this Relative to Avg)  Using Apps script, I wrote a simple program that repeatedly plugs in various stock tickers into the ""Stock 2"" box and takes each of the three variables mentioned above. Below I have attached a separate sheet that is the result of a test between $SPY and each of the 503 companies in the S&P 500 over a 180 day time frame.  Results from $SPY 180 day test: [SPY Correlation Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cYyDCTUb8KKtBdxcrRAkAIY0vvE3m2kIVnszvcg3Rlg/edit#gid=1003617349)  You might have to make a copy of the Google Sheet, but once you do that, you should be able to use the ""Filter"" table on the right to look for companies that meet a specific correlation, slope, or Relative to Avg threshold.  I don't want to share the link to the actual Google Sheet I use to do all of this because it took quite a bit of time and effort, but if anyone has a specific company and time frame they want me to run the program for, I'd be happy to do that and share something similar to the [SPY Correlation Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cYyDCTUb8KKtBdxcrRAkAIY0vvE3m2kIVnszvcg3Rlg/edit#gid=1003617349) sheet that I linked above.

[In 2000, Google bought 6.6~~6~~% of ADT](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/03/google-to-invest-450-million-to-acquire-a-6point6percent-stake-in-adt.html) and then [immediately and quietly discontinued Nest Secure](https://www.techradar.com/news/google-discontinues-nest-secure-here-are-the-best-security-system-alternatives) only 2 months later. Google offered $200 or a crappppppy current ADT setup/service valued at $465. Reddit and everywhere online, including Nest's own user troubleshooting website, is full of people that are MAD.  [Then someone at Verge found this in October 2023](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23915644/adt-google-security-system-nest-secure-leak), which is basically Nest's system rebranded as ADT. End of January 2024, more fuel added to the fire when [they found some youtube videos of the new system](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24048187/adt-smart-home-security-system-google-nest-launch).  Today, I got a notification [that they're going ex-dividend shortly.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adt-inc-nyse-adt-stock-115149765.html)  With the Nest Secure end of support/operation being April 8th, it's safe to say that sometime between March 13th and April 8th Google and/or ADT are going to announce their rebranded Nest hardware is being sold by ADT, and if you buy ADT stock on or before March 12th, you'll get the dividend of supporting them (which is likely gonna be Google's return on that 6% investment).  Supposedly the break between 2020 and 2024 is because they made a deal with another security company to resell services, so they had to support any new installs for a minimum of 3 years. Now that all of those contracts are completed, Google and ADT will likely try to dominate the market again with another product they'll abandon in 2-3 years. Eff you Google for discontinuing Stadia.  I have zero money in this stock sadly, all of the monies are tied up in -stock-not-allowed-to-mention-here- and my new house. Regard~~less~~, this stock was something that I haven't seen on here yet, so I wanted to share.";"0";"2024-03-08T17:32:21"

"If you missed the NVDA train, buy ARM";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1b8499a/if_you_missed_the_nvda_train_buy_arm/";"Summary: I fully expect Nvidia and Jensen Huang to go after ARM and acquire a (rather large) stake at any moment, possibly as soon as lockup expires next week. If Trump wins election and FTC changes leadership, Nvidia will likely try to acquire ARM outright.   Background: In late September 2020, [Nvidia announced plans to acquire ARM from Softbank](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-for-40-billion-creating-worlds-premier-computing-company-for-the-age-of-ai) for $40 billion. At that time, NVDA was \~ $400 billion company, 10x the value of ARM. In December 2021, the [FTC sues to block the merger](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-sues-block-40-billion-semiconductor-chip-merger) citing anti-competitive advantages the combined firm would do in the AI race. On February 2022, Nvidia and Softbank announce [the termination of Nvidia acquitition of ARM Holdings](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-softbank-group-announce-termination-of-nvidias-acquisition-of-arm-limited) and Softbank immediately announced plans to IPO ARM. ARM would IPO in September of 2023.   All the major tech companies in the world (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom, AMD, META, Tesla, and many many others) are working to design their own chips, most are based on [ARM architecture](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/11/09/how-arm-gained-chip-dominance-with-apple-nvidia-amazon-and-qualcomm.html) and Jensen Huang sees the writing on the wall. Jensen also knows that his main competitors, including some of the big boys, are also champing at the bit to either get their own stake or prevent Nvidia from cornering the entire market outright. It's a race against the inevitable.   If Nvidia was successful in acquiring ARM back in 2021, those $40 billion NVDA shares would be worth $220 billion to Softbank today if we go by the 10x valuation metric that both Nvidia and Softbank likely agreed upon back in 2020.   TL:DR: Missed NVDA run, buy ARM shares or leaps. Not investment advice!  &#x200B:";"1194";"2024-03-06T17:37:49"

"When are the benefits of AI coming to life to consumers?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18exhpj/when_are_the_benefits_of_ai_coming_to_life_to/";"With the pace with which AI is accelerating and the whole of S&P being pumped for the entire 2023, what actual monetization value did AI provide to companies up until now?  Sure you have models with billions of parameters. But how are companies going to monetize it? Who will be the end user for these AI models? I feel like 99% of the population doesn't care about any of this and is very hesitant to change any of their habits. Example being iphone vs Android - maybe android has lots of new shiny features which the iphone doesn't but who cares. Majority of ppl are not ready to adopt android as the daily phones. Another example being Google vs chatgpt - yes chatgpt might be the new shiny thing which can answer your questions but since the popularity of internet google has been the go to tool for ppl. I think apple is playing this smartly by not heavily investing in something which isn't proven to significantly increase their revenue.  Question is, if the end consumer is not ready to change their habits how will the new AI tech which is being touted as the next big thing be transformative? Is this all hype and how can we justify so much pump for these companies if their profit margins don't increase?";"10";"2023-12-10T07:37:56"

I'm 87 and immobile in a wheelchair and don't know anything about semiconductors or anything else technology related. I cannot Google or text, and I currently have someone who lives in my home 24/7 and wipes my ass for me. However, I'm a damn intuitive savant when it comes to tricking gullible kids.  I did grow up in the biggest bull market in human history with some Boomers printing money like Chuck E. Cheese bucks.. and everyone is a genius in a bull market.. Well almost everyone. I didn't invest so now I just scam Millennials and Zoomers.  Anyway, I like talking stocks with my grandson because it’s something we could connect on, and I have a ton of experience selling worthless advice to idiots. So in 2018 we were talking about the market, and I casually brought up Nvidia. He thought I didn't guide him to that at all. He bought Nvidia in 2017 so he was familiar with it although he bought his shares at 18 yrs old with $2k he had saved up. Nothing insane although he kept 90% to this day. I said I saw NVIDIA in a newspaper article with someone recommending it for elderly’s retirement accounts. So I told my grandson I was an OGangster, called my broker and bought 1,000 shares on the spot because in my words: “I don’t buy a stock if I can’t afford 1,000 shares”. Something only the Zoomers dumb enough to buy meme stocks would fall for.   He was dumbstruck because here he thought he was doing great with his savings over the years, and I just humbled his ass with a completely made up sentence. Add in the 4:1 stock split, and now he thinks I'm sitting on 4,000 shares. (I ""confirmed"" it to him when he brought it up in the last month). I haven't sold a dime and don't even know what the price is doing day to day because I don't own any shares.  I'm just chilling in my wheelchair and letting him try to get a bigger share of the inheritance. He called and celebrated with me the other day because he transparently wants to get in my will. He thinks I'm already wealthy and dumb enough to drop 6 figures on a stock I know little about.  He hopes to inherit my wealth someday, but he’s also a scammy, golddigging SOB and he knows it! Told me “haha you're a genius investor and luck has nothing to do with”. Thought id share here because I’m not sharing this IRL, but I find it pretty ironic my dumb ass grandson is outwiping 95% of this sub. Wendy's boys included.";"21839";"2024-02-21T22:56:15"

Nvidia Tesla Meta Microsoft Amazon Apple Google  And we can we can see these companies don't all things in common, but they have a few things.  Platform monopolies: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon. These companies all have monopolies and no one cares and can continue to die wherever they want to print money  Risks:  Google lost their app store monopoly lawsuit   Amazon loses money to run an unprofitable retail business to get a monopoly. Everyone else has comparable offerings to AWS.  Meta and Google: these are social media plays. The easiest way to destroy America or influence it's politics is via Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube. Foreign governments and local politicians all dump money into these platforms to cause civil unrest and pollute minds.  Risks: Eventually America might actually fall and social media won't be useful anymore. Alternatively, America will topple the governments of the countries doing this, such as Russia and China. Low risk of either outcome.  Nvidia and Tesla. Enron style financial scams. These companies play financial shell games and provide lines of credit to shell companies and broke customers so they can buy their products on paper and manipulate their product prices upwards. Thankfully, Enron ran for almost a decade before it blew up and these companies have only a few years of shady finances, 5 at most for Telsa and less for Nvidia. They may blow up, but not today and not tomorrow.  Risks: the super profitable Enron schemes blow up sooner for Nvidia and Tesla than they did for Enron and we enter the second dotcom burst.  As we can see, all of the magnificent 7 are going to print money for the foreseeable future, at least another 5-10 years until a radical wins office and does major overalls of the systems that allow these companies to be super profitable.";"0";"2023-12-19T03:59:42"

Only Two Surgical Robots approved by the FDA. Intuitive Surgical / $ISRG enjoyed a literal monopoly for over two decades and just two years before pandemic worldwide pause, a second ever contender was FDA approved. Now it's post pandemic and it's on like Donkey Kong.  Intuitive and another one that is super low market cap, wsb bot won't let me post name without deleting my post, due to it's market cap. But it's interesting to note, that despite it's small market cap, it is completely DEBT FREE, and has powerful investors / board seat members, like Andrea Biffi, from SOFAR, an Italian pharma heavy weight, now MA'd(Merger Aquisitioned) by an even larger Pharma: Alfasigma, THE LARGEST Pharmaceutical company in Italy. So I wont name it. But I believe this small Market Cap contender will eventually cause ISRG to tumble and thus making ISRG a juicy short within the next year. It's close to 300 bucks right now. So I'm buying puts on ISRG.  Intuitive has super crappy technology vs recently FDA approved competitor. Competitor of Intuitive is less expensive. And has Re usable tools. Haptic Feedback for Surgeon. Eyetracking Camera. Google Cloud Healthcare AI and Nvidia partnership.  1. More on Google Health Care AI Cloud Colab, Competitor has had a formal collab since February of this year: Note what Ashima Gupta Global Director of Healthcare For Google AI Cloud said back then:  https://preview.redd.it/dipy098l2atb1.png?width=1582&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ceb8cc19072ffb131bdf3dc9bdbb578598fb2b2  2. Note what Director Said in Today's (10-9-23) Press Release to CNBC :  “These are the workflows that the physicians and nurses live by day in and day out. You can’t be adding friction to it,” Gupta told CNBC in an interview. “We are very cautious of that — that we are respecting the surface they use, that the workflow doesn’t change, but yet they get the power of this technology.” Link to today's press release: where quote is from:  [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/09/google-announces-new-generative-ai-search-capabilities-for-doctors-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/09/google-announces-new-generative-ai-search-capabilities-for-doctors-.html)  Other press release links that have GOOGL up today:  [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hackensack-meridian-healths-cloud-and-data-modernization-with-google-cloud-enhances-patient-care-and-drives-innovation-301950222.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hackensack-meridian-healths-cloud-and-data-modernization-with-google-cloud-enhances-patient-care-and-drives-innovation-301950222.html)  [https://www.infoworld.com/article/3708295/google-vertex-ai-search-updated-with-healthcare-and-life-sciences-capabilities.html](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3708295/google-vertex-ai-search-updated-with-healthcare-and-life-sciences-capabilities.html)  NOTE: The Hospitals that are part of Googles First Release for beta release ARE THE SAME HOSPITALS WITH SENHANCES Surgical Robots. Mayo Clinic and Hackensak. Please note that the Competitor is working to UPLOAD live video and picures and all kinds of DATASETS for AI and AI search for HEALTHCARE FIELD. Competitor has Senhances worldwide with over 10,000 procedures and like Tesla's record driver data and add it to Nueralink, the same happens with each Senhance that EACH SURGEON DRIVES, and Google / NVIDIA / Competitor are getting all Surgical Dataset gold. Very likely Google will pay Senhance creators a royalty to Competitor of ISRG. The fact is ISRG is flatfooted and will get rocked by this collab. When you see videos, links below, you will see Hackensack. And you will also see pic of Mayo Clinic Pediatrics anouncement a little over two weeks ago. See below for pics and links for further info/research/dd.  Intuitive Surgical / $ISRG eye gauges the poor hospitals and surgeons by requiring them to buy new tools every 5th, 10th, 12th, or MAX: 18th surgical procedure-depending on the tool robotic tip.  Yes you read that correct. EVERY 18th SURGICAL PROCEDURE. The bulk of their revenues comes from this obvious and  unsustainable eye gauging. Vs Competitor, whose tools are able to be re used indefinitely for life of tool. One Surgical Robot Surgeon mentioned they had been using the same tools from the Competitor for over 3 years!!Please google-I have links below-but you can google for yourselves also if you like:  Carlos Mendoza Herrera Master Surgeon from Cedar Sinai in Chicago. Also google = Amit Travedi , Hackensack Medical Hospital, Carlos Mendoza Herrera / Sinai Chicago, links below.  Notice picture=Also notice the open cockpit design of Competitor vs ISRG. ISRG surgical Robot Da  Vinci kills your peripheral view and forces you to hunch over, and you lose your clear line of sight of operating table and staff. Your head needs to go inside a hole in the machine.  Then you need to stare through two more holes. While on Senhance from Competitor, you keep a clear line of sight, sit comfortably upright and maintain a clear line of sight on operating table and staff. And stare a beautiful screen that's in front of you.  Competitor to ISRG currently has a formal Google Healthcare Cloud Agreement since February. And another formal agreement with juggernaut Nvidia, anounced much more recently-see pics below.  Mayo Clinic recently added the Competitors Surgical robot over Da Vinci becuase of all the aformentioned PLUS ISRG DOES NOT HAVE 3mm ports. In other words, 3mm is the literal size the robotic arms can cut to enter the thoracic cavity in order to operate. And so after surgical procedure, you don't have a foot long gaping wound stitched from which to heal from, but literally a 3mm cut. maybe like three 3mm cuts from which to heal from. An Inch is 25mm. To give you an idea of how small that is and how fast post operative healing can be especially for tiny infants that are a month old that can't handle 8mm or 12mm cuts the smallest ISRG has.  ISRG will take years to get FDA approval for a complete refresh to compete with an open cockpit design where the surgeon is upright looking at a screen. Also ISRG will take years to get 3mm approved and field pre clinically tested. Things the competitor ALREADY HAS FDA APPROVED AND IN THE MARKET AS THE MAYO CLINIC RECENTLY SHOWED. ISRG in their monopolistic comfort rested on it's laurels technology never bothered or cared to refresh their tech and upgrade, because they were the only game in town and never had to for over two decades so hospitals and doctors had to deal with what they ( $ISRG) gave them. Now they're caught flat footed.  \*A little deviation on what is Laparoscopy -and why Robotic Surgery is an evolution to that:  So the question I keep asking myself is WHY hasn't ISRG come up with 3mm port and a better open cockpit design in 23 years of their monopoly? Because they've never really needed to improve their lower tier tech, because there literally was NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE THAN THEM. This led to massive abuse on their part, more on that below, lawsuits and unhappy Hospitals and medical centers.  All robotic surgery crux is a minimally invasive surgery from smaller wounds you can heal from. so your up and running faster, with less pain, and can return to work, family, your routine in a much shorter time span than from an open surgery that leaves a massive wound maybe a foot long, that cuts through muscle, tendons, perhaps bones. Please see video links below for more explanation on this. They are short videos, like 2-5 minutes long. Laparoscopy was the MANUAL way of minimally invasive surgery, meaning an endoscopic camera gets placed inside your body, through a small incision and two tiny arms that are controlled manually, obviously this is a challenging form of surgery, but under skilled surgeons, extremely successful. With robotic surgery you have the steady hand, tremor free, you're able to sit down through out the process, and lessen the fatigue of hours long surgeries, ergo more successful, and safer surgeries, perhaps one after the other. Plus Software like no fly zones where the robot arm cannot extend and injure or maim a certain organ accidentally-something not avail with manual Laparascopy. Something ISRG does NOT have but Senhance does. See Lawsuits link below. Also measuring distances between organs, etc, can be done with software. VS inserting a phsyical sterilized ruler which was the way it was done before manually without the robotics-but still done with ISRG. Also articulated instruments inside the abdomen, add more dexterity with robotic surgical systems.  These are the advantages of Robotic Surgeriy over manual minimally invasive Laparoscopic surgeries. So robotic surgery is a level above manual laparascopy. Manaual Laparascopy was a level up from traditional open surgery.\*  &#x200B:  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/g1imbfz7u9tb1.jpg?width=2254&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e5bd9cdb7b6baa35464216d31b101a3ffa99126  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/xci95rxfu9tb1.jpg?width=2527&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4464f9f8789bc2122e3761c24946b6b14f21ff9d  https://preview.redd.it/6nnbxodau9tb1.png?width=497&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7e8e43a9e14ecaf2407a6c9a17162446e22cdef  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/kpx4m6aju9tb1.jpg?width=2205&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e273bb0eb0b38ab8bb3c360ad9b7f0bcb77adc6  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/9goamytpu9tb1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2a885341ead73d490af5307a68b79d86011d7b1a  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/ll0j2zfsu9tb1.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&s=7652bc0b1541771be87a2020bef95d65eb68dda7  &#x200B:  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/nuhxkrj85atb1.jpg?width=1044&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4be72bc25d696747823e2aa8708942b7666dd202  ISRG tries to scrub their lawsuits on the internet but no die.

Based on Latest Cantor Fitzgerald Healthcare Expo, about a week ago, COO mentioned they had a clear 510 clearance for LUNA. The 2.0 iteration to Senhance.  Please note: Competitor has an excellent track record in getting FDA approvals. 3mm port. Pediatrics. JnJ, Stryker, Titan Medical, GE, have all tried with their massive market caps, and resources, to get their robots FDA approved to compete in this juicy market and only one has been able to do it.  So this competitor with a lower Market Cap, is a strong contender with strong alliances, that make it a massive sledge hammer for ISRG.

And letting you guys know about it. It's a big thick juicy short, over 200 hundred bucks, close to 300 bucks a share. And short puts are relatively inexpensive right now. Not too inexpensive but still inexpensive in my book, very manageable price. My view is it took Tesla 17 years to become profitable in a multi competitor arena, there were several cars people could choose from. Here? there's ONLY TWO in the ENTIRE VAST MARKET of Surgeries, which all will be moving in some way shape or form to digitized, robotics. So either ISRG stops resting on it's monopolistic laurels or gets taken to the barn out back and shot, like Ford, GM, Chrysler/Stellantis has, by Tesla. Another fun fact: Toyota: It took them 26 years to become profitable. My point, This is LITERALLY a two man market. Competitor and ISRG. And one is lagging with tech and customer satisfaction and treatment, while the other is excelling.  I'll be editing the post as time goes by, with any further news or updates.

"Shareholder Vote to Remove Sundar Pichai from Alphabet?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ct7o59/shareholder_vote_to_remove_sundar_pichai_from/";"Full disclosure, this is all hypothetical, and my meager holdings of Alphabet are below double digits.  However, Alphabet has been going down a bad path, and the management is hollowing out the value of this tech giant for short term profit. I understand Alphabet needed to reorganize and slim down. Yet, there are strategic reductions, and then there is peacocking to investors for short term gain.  I think a lot of Google’s problems have stemmed from Sundar mismanagement of the company. The company has only iterated on existing products, and [it has failed to innovate at all](https://notes.willrobbins.org/p/google-has-50b-doesnt-innovate). It is inevitable to some degree, but it shouldn’t have happened so quickly. Alphabet had years of a head start and the best talent in the market.  In sum, I think the recent reductions and policies are really trading short term gains for the long term viability of the company. These are opinions to an extent, but it is hard to defend the management given any recent headline.";"4";"2024-05-16T09:53:38"
"Apple - Regardless of this Quarter: Now is the time";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ce31se/apple_regardless_of_this_quarter_now_is_the_time/";"Based on recent market activity I think this is a good entry point for Apple off the lows.  Here are all the reasons why not to like Apple right now  * Fall in phone sales especially in China * They have been absolutely sideways for the past 12 months and down \~9% for the year. * Things are going to look bad for this quarter that's a given. * Apple Vision is not selling well (give that thing a controller and games my god) * Regulators are breathing down their neck (I do feel some of it is justified regardless of what Cramer says) * It's been absent in this AI bonanza - probably their worst offense  However, with all of that said there is one thing that Apple has in its perpetual back pocket.  Install Base & Great Product recognition  Before I get into 2 companies that Apple will absolutely trounce, I want to talk about a prediction that is coming for their upcoming June developer conference.  Apple will 1000% announce their AI strategy. It is a foregone conclusion they will do this and in a meaningful way. If they don't do this it would be corporate malfeasance and Tim Cook should resign immediately. But why?  AI is something that YOU MUST get out the door and have people using it. It's not web search where you can make a deal with Google to use their AI offering. And BTW if you think that deal is going to happen with Google it 1000% is not. Apple would insane to do that. You have get your models up, trained and running. If you don't they can never improve. They can't get more training data. And, Apple is already reporting that they have models that are performing well.  ~~To pay Google or anyone for Models when Meta is just releasing models for free right now is a non-starter. Apple will make their own AI models.~~  Apparently not. Apple is now talking to OpenAI too. So Apple using Microsoft. lol hmmm. Interesting.  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true)  The fact that Apple isn't even look to compete with their own models is just wild to me.   As much as I wish Microsoft and or OpenAI would do a hardware device (regarding AI), Apple has the install base to do something meaningful and in a big way with consumers. Literally, this can be another vertical for Apple.  Other hardware, such as ""The PIN"" and ""the Rabbit"" are horrible devices. The Rabbit is OK but it is beyond obvious that your phone is going to be able to do what those devices do shortly. Literally, all Apple has to do is look at anything worthwhile on those devices, what's not worthwhile on them and come out with a future Iphone that does all that and more. It will be like taking candy from a baby.  Edge AI, in my opinion is going to be a great game changer and very practical use case for what profitable AI will look like. Whether it's a Robot or your HER / hand-held device edge AI is where this all goes.  Samsung has already begun AI on the phone and I don't really use it because of 1 reason. It's not a great foundational model like OpenAI's ChatGPT or anything good that is native on the phone. And this is the beautiful thing about Apple. If Apple can just be good enough with their AI models - They're opportunity is different than any other player in the mobile space. They can put a model that they make directly on the phone. True Edge AI. Nobody else has the opportunity to do that in the way Apple does. This will make the AI faster, more responsive, great computer vision, audio capabilities will all be native on the phone.  All for $20 / $30 a month that Apple sheep will be happy to pay for.  Look for Apple to begin that story this June.  My position: Currently I have 1 share but I think now is the time.";"51";"2024-04-27T04:00:49"
"Blackrock BTC ETF does not insure against theft/hacking, and on the Coinbase custodian side, only $100 million is insured?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/199pjym/blackrock_btc_etf_does_not_insure_against/";"So I was reading the [prospectus for the Blackrock BTC ETF](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/333011/ishares-bitcoin-trust). And I noticed the following excerpts.   From page 82, it seems the maximum amount that Blackrock can recover from Coinbase in a case of hacking/theft of BTC is only $100 million:  > the Bitcoin Custodian’s aggregate liability in respect of each cold storage address shall not exceed $100 million;  From page 81, it seems that Coinbase has a maximum insurance of $320 million among all its customers (I assume not just ETF customers, but also regular people who have opened a Coinbase account):  >Coinbase Global maintains a commercial crime insurance policy of up to $320 million ... ... The insurance maintained by Coinbase Global is shared among all of Coinbase’s customers,  And on page 33, it seems that even if an internal Blackrock employee went rogue and stole all the Bitcoins, Blackrock won't insure against that either:  >Although the Trust’s transfers of bitcoin will regularly be made to or from the Trust’s account at the Bitcoin Custodian, it is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, the Trust’s bitcoin could be transferred from the Trust’s account at the Bitcoin Custodian in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties, or to uncontrolled accounts ... ... To the extent that the Trust is unable to seek a corrective transaction with such third-party or is incapable of identifying the third-party which has received the Trust’s bitcoins through error or theft, the Trust will be unable to revert or otherwise recover incorrectly transferred bitcoins. The Trust will also be unable to convert or recover its bitcoins transferred to uncontrolled accounts. To the extent that the Trust is unable to seek redress for such error or theft, such loss could adversely affect the value of the Shares.  The general idea I get about the Blackrock BTC ETF prospectus is that there really isn't any insurance, and if there is any hacking/theft of Bitcoin and the ETF collapses, there is no protection against you losing everything. If this is the case, this is a shame, since I was hoping there was more protection mechanisms to hold a BTC ETF over holding BTC yourself (if I pass away and I hold a BTC ETF, at least my BTC ETF can be left for my family members through inheritance, but if I hold BTC and my family members don't know my private key, my BTC is lost forever).";"362";"2024-01-18T13:56:44"
