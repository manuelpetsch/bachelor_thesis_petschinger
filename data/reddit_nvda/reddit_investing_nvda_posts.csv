"Nvidia reminds me of Cisco during dotcom.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/193x11g/nvidia_reminds_me_of_cisco_during_dotcom/";"**Note**: This post is *descriptive* of my personal observations and is for discussion purposes only. It is neither *predictive* in what will happen next nor is it *prescriptive* in suggesting any course of investment actions.   I've only done [3 predictive posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/s/pAtSiWhCXo) on this sub and this won't be one of them.  For those who are too young to remember that time:  There was this new thing called ""the Internet"", and it was going to forever change the world (it eventually did), and every company that hypes up some sort of ""internet tech"" (could be simple landing page that sells stuff, i.e Pets.com) received sky high valuation.   And there was one company behind it that made it all possible: Cisco, the company that sells industrial routers and switches to telecom providers that power the backbone of the entire internet infrastructure, was *obviously* a company that was ""selling shovels during a gold rush"" and would take over the whole world.   Its share price went up 236% from Jan.1999 to March 2000, reached a valuation of $500B+ (record high for a company back then), P/E went through the roof but it didn't matter because the *Internet Revolution^TM* was *just beginning* (and it was), so naturally Cisco's share price could only go higher.  The cherry on the top was that back then the **top two** companies were *Microsoft* and *Cisco*, one would provide the software (**Internet Explorer baby!**) and the other would sell the hardware. Together they would rule the world!  Now if you replace ""Internet"" with ""AI"", and ""Cisco"" with ""Nvidia"", keep Microsoft as it is (but replace ""IE"" with ChatGPT""), and we have quite a mirror version of what's happening today.  Then we all know what happened. Cisco obviously survived the bubble burst and remains profitable and is still doing fine today, but $CSCO *never* recovered back to its dotcom bubble peak after crashing 80% during the dotcom bust, 23 years later.  Now will the same thing happen with $NVDA? Like I said I don't know and I'm not making any predictions. All I can say is that I see a lot of parallels *so far*.  **Edit**: For people replying to me arguing how you can't mine Bitcoins using network switches or how Cisco didn't do AI, *no kidding*, at no point did I claim the two companies are identical and sell the same things, that would be idiotic.  All I am saying is the *hype*, *expectation*, and *position* of these two companies in their respective backdrop, are *similar* to each other.";"404";"2024-01-11T09:39:35"
"NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock - Wait? or Sell?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b93ybd/nvidia_nvda_stock_wait_or_sell/";"I don't invest much. but bought NVDA 2 years ago ..and well, it grew from 200ish USD to 900ish USD.  In the last year, I've been mostly investing in ETFs like VOO just because I don't follow business/investing news too much and ETFs seem easy. Anyway, I'm wondering if I should just sell all my NVDA  (15 stocks) and purchase VOO or SMH. Or do people think that this upward trend with NVDA will continue?  I have a few other stocks like Apple, Microsoft, etc that I bought years ago and haven't touched since.  **Update**: Thank you all for sharing your views. I'm a beginner and this really helps my learning. I decided to hold for a longer time, since I don't really need the cash for anything now and I don't have plans for the $ that I have in NVDA.

"After the Bell: Nvidia clobbers earnings expectations as AI demand hits ‘tipping point’: stock up 6%";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awpej3/after_the_bell_nvidia_clobbers_earnings/";"I haven’t seen this posted yet. So excuse me if it becomes a duplicate. But I figured this would be of interest to people because Nvidia has been the poster child for whether or not this is an AI bubble.  I think everyone was taking wait-and-see on their earnings. And the naysayers would be able to point to missed expectations as a sign that this is a bubble.

The company is calling for $24.0 billion in revenue, up from $7.2 billion a year prior, while analysts were modeling $22.2 billion.  > Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,” Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a release. “Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.”  > Nvidia posted fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $12.3 billion, or $4.93 a share, compared with $1.4 billion, or 57 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $5.16 a share, while analysts were projecting $4.59 a share.  I own Nvidia, so I admit, I am biased. But I think anyway you slice those numbers, they’re pretty damn impressive. If it’s a bubble, it’s a bubble that people are buying into. And by people, I mean, giant, multinational companies. It’s amazing growth for a company so large.   I’m hoping this brings some calm back to the markets. We’ve been pivoting between irrational exuberance and panic.  **EDIT**: it is the next day, and the results are in. My personal account earned 27.9% TODAY. That is from 2 NVDA options and 1 SMCI option. My larger retirement account made 11.2% today based on NVDA stock SMCI stock NVDA option and lots of ETFs. Probably no one will see this edit. But as a normal investor, the reason I’m in this space is because of these returns. The reason a lot of people are here are because of these returns. And you can choose to ignore them if they are outside your risk and comfort level. That makes perfect sense. But there are compelling reasons to be here as well.";"959";"2024-02-21T23:25:44"
"Nvidia shares spike 26% on huge forecast beat driven by A.I. chip demand";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/13r52us/nvidia_shares_spike_26_on_huge_forecast_beat/";"https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/05/24/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2024.html  Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings for its fiscal 2024 on Wednesday, with a stronger-than-expected forecast that drove shares up 26% in extended trading.  Here's how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates for the quarter ended in April:  EPS: $1.09, adjusted, versus 92 cents expected Revenue: $7.19 billion, versus $6.52 billion expected Nvidia said it expected sales of about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%, in the current quarter, more than 50% higher than Wall Street estimates of $7.15 billion.  Prior to the after-hours move, Nvidia stock was up 109% so far in 2023, mostly driven by optimism stemming from the company's leading position in the market for artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company was seeing ""surging demand"" for its data center products.  Nvidia's data center group reported $4.28 billion in sales, versus expectations of $3.9 billion, a 14% annual increase. Nvidia said that performance was driven by demand for its GPU chips from cloud vendors as well as large consumer internet companies, which use Nvidia chips to train and deploy generative AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.  Nvidia's strong performance in data center shows that AI chips are becoming increasingly important for cloud providers and other companies that run large numbers of servers.  However, Nvidia's gaming division, which includes the company's graphics cards for PC sales, reported a 38% drop in revenue to $2.24 billion in sales versus expectations of $1.98 billion. Nvidia blamed the decline on a slower macroeconomic environment as well as the ramp up of the company's latest GPUs for gaming.  Nvidia's automotive division, including chips and software to develop self-driving cars, grew 114% year over year, but remains small at under $300 million in sales for the quarter.  Net income for the quarter was $2.04 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with $1.62 billion, or 64 cents, during the year-earlier period. Nvidia's overall sales fell 13% from $8.29 billion a year ago.  *Personal take*: I don’t even know what to say, this is simply astonishing. The AFH price puts NVDA at 20% above its previous ATH. This jump would have been insane even for 2021, let alone the tech market of 2023.  AI will be the main focus and the main buzzword for the entire tech industry for the next few years, and I expect many companies to pivot toward that one way or another (even if it’s just paying PR lip service) in order to catch the wind in the sail.";"1363";"2023-05-25T04:13:21"
"How far behind Nvidia is AMD?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/162qftl/how_far_behind_nvidia_is_amd/";"From what I’ve read, Nvidia’s only real competitors, for now, are AMD and Intel. Intel handles manufacturing, whereas AMD is fabless like Nvidia, so AMD is a much closer competitor in terms of business model and product offering.  Admittedly, I am pretty unfamiliar with the technical elements of semiconductors, but I understand demand for AMD chips is nowhere close to that of Nvidia’s, and market share in advanced chips will be skewed toward Nvidia for at least a few years.  Those of you with a better understanding of chip tech and the semiconductor industry: Is it likely just a matter of time before AMD catches up, or is there something fundamental missing from AMD’s products that puts Nvidia ahead for the foreseeable future?";"305";"2023-08-27T15:28:29"

This will affect Nvidia’s margins and the company’s ability to continue to grow at such a staggering rate.   > the competition is coming from an array of places [in addition to AMD who is predicting $4B for their new GPU] that include a number of Nvidia’s largest and most important customers. For example, Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS cloud has its AI chips for training and inference, Microsoft recently announced its Maia AI chip, and Alphabet Inc.’s Google continues to innovate on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Oracle Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also developing AI chips in house.   > not as much an indictment on Nvidia as they are a realization by these companies that overdependence on a single source for AI semiconductors is a risk  > In short, competition is real and it is coming to Nvidia in a meaningful way.

I lived through .com era and it was vastly different. If you said you were an online mall, you could get $1 billion the next day. Because people understood malls and this Internet thing was going to raise all roofs.   Pets.com? I know what a pet is..com makes it even better!  I remember the exact street I was driving on when the one trillionth radio advertisement for Amazon came on the radio. And I was like, what a stupid name for a bookstore. Amazon has nothing to do with books. And for years and years and years, Amazon, lost money. They only existed because that.com Bubble had lifted them so far they had Cash. Lotsa cash. But they were a joke for about a decade.  But the real big thing was almost none of those companies had a profit. They didn’t make any money whatsoever. None. No business. They were burning through cash with expensive offices, expensive staff, oh man, salaries for tech workers were astronomical.  The companies that did have a profit, we’re making pennies. Or there profit margins were incredibly slim. There were only handfuls of companies that were catapulted by the bubble that didn’t meet this criteria.  Cisco was in a similar situation to Nvidia. Cisco built the tools that would enable this tremendous new technology. but their net profit margin was like 17%. Vastly less than nvidias. Nvidia forward p/e is 54. Ciscos was 150.

Now up ~175% YTD, in a market that has rallied strongly since the start of the year, with AI being the hot new thing, there is talks of Nvidia (and AI in general) being a bubble. That Nvidia is overvalued.  But I want to point this out: despite the 25% jump in price this week, NVDA shares actually got **cheaper** on a forward P/E basis.  https://i.imgur.com/xPQR2OF.png  Prior to the report, it was traded at ~60x forward earnings. After the report, it trades at ~50x. And that 50x is only ~1 standard deviation away from it's 5 year average range.  This relative valuation holds for pretty much every metric  https://i.imgur.com/iMejuuf.png  Relative to it's peers, Nvidia, despite the massive single day jump, doesn't trade much more than above it's historical average.  https://i.imgur.com/4nP2u9w.png  Why is this? Because in hindsight, analyst expectations were somehow *too low*.  One year forward revenue grew from ~$30B to ~$40B, a 33% jump  Two year forward revenue went from ~$37B to ~$50B, a 35% jump  One year forward EPS went from ~$4.55 to ~$7, a 55% jump  Two year forward EPS went from ~$6.50 to ~$9.60, a 46% jump  2025 operating profit expectations a week ago were $16.6B. After reporting, now $27B  Forward gross margins went from 67.5% to 70.5%  Forward free cash flow went from $11.4B to $20.4B  I know it sounds like beating a dead horse here, but Nvidia just gave guidance that is them screaming that a transformational change is incoming.  Will the stock continue to keep going up every day? Of course not.

I don't think other big tech (Microsoft, OpenAI, and AWS) giants will order more GPUs because running a general-purpose GPU is very expensive: [Running ChatGPT is very expensive for the company. Each query costs roughly 4 cents, according to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/)   Google already has its own ASICs chips called TPU.    Apple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet, then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family.      Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run.  And want to diversify to other chip makers, like AMD, Intel, and specialized ARM makers.     Small businesses experiment and run their AI models using rented Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud capacities (mostly Google because of their TPU's low power-to-cost ratio).      The rest of the market is peanuts to make any dent.      **\[Conclusions\]:** Their a moderate-low probability Q4 revenues will reach a plateau of around 15-20 billion.  A moderate probability that they will be below 15 billion. A low probability of exceeding 20 billion.  &#x200B:  ***Let's sidestep to AI marker TAM topic,***        [*Meanwhile, looking forward to 2027, the server market's value is estimated at a staggering $195.6 billion.*](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-ai-and-hpc-gpu-sales-reportedly-approached-half-a-million-units-in-q3-thanks-to-meta-facebook)   However, this estimated revenue will be brought by those who rent AI processing capacities like AWS, GCP, and Azure cloud providers. And not ChatGPT clones. The market has not figured yet the TAM (total addressable market) of services like ChatGPT.       However, I try to speculate on [open numbers](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users), which have stagnated for the last 6 months.      100 million monthly active users \* 10$ per subscription produces 1 billion in revenue.    [The average cost of 1 query from a used is 4 cents](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/).     A single user runs 2,000 queries per month on average. The query is a single text message you send to the chatbot.      2000 \* 0.04 = 80 $ to service 1 user per month.    Until the OpenAI level of efficiency improves they will be losing 70$ to service 1 user per month.    No wonder OpenAI has closed its ChatGPT Plus subscription.  It doesn't seem sustainable.     Last note,  the majority of data centers upgrade their equipment every 4-5 years. So, if AI expectations won't burst, and chip efficiency improves 10-fold, and other chip makers won't catch up, don't expect big tech to re-stock their chips earlier than the end of 2027.      &#x200B:";"1";"2024-01-21T23:17:52"

Their FPE moved significantly down from 58 -- there is an argument at $500/sh next 12mos FPE could be under 30 (EPS of $18/sh), but we can wait for the analysts numbers for a more accurate calculation.  Either way, explosive growth like this seems unprecedented in modern times.  I described the company's management, execution, about their strategy, and argued in the above link and how Nvidia has little in the way of competition.    They seemingly own Infrastructure for the next generation of computing, AI, and they are delivering on the promise.  70%GMs, a clear runway littered with fat margin dollars waiting to be scooped up, and no one giving any kind of meaningful challenge.

"Gene Munster - Dan Nathan - Other Bear Nvidia Analysts Get This One Thing Wrong. There will be NO Glut Or Epic Fall - Nvidia is Now a Cloud Provider of Accelerated Compute";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1axqdrd/gene_munster_dan_nathan_other_bear_nvidia/";"Gene was giving a great analysis of Nvidia potential headwinds into the future of this AI Super Cycle.      <video here>      The problem is I don't think these analyst are getting how Nvidia works which is weird because they literally have direct access to Jensen.      I think the word ""Data Center"" is confusing. I think they believe that data center means something that is not cloud like but rather a super computer that is shipped to someone who then uses it in the cloud. And that's it they ship the hardware and Nvidia never sees them again.      That's not what is going on here.      First, Nvidia can direct sell you cloud like access to all their hardware and software services all by themselves.      NVIDIA DGX Cloud is a serverless, AI-training-as-a-service platform for enterprises that depend on AI.      With integrated best-in-class software, direct access to NVIDIA AI experts, and near-limitless access to high-performance compute, DGX Cloud delivers industry-leading utilization efficiency with scale and productive work capacity for developers—at the lowest TCO compared with traditional infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) approaches.      Dan Nathan just seems either confused or just willfully attempting to rally a short position. I lean to the latter because I can't believe he is actually believing what he is saying but I could be wrong.      Maybe Dan is just confused.      Second, You can then access Nvidia with all of it's software and services FROM effectively a third party such as Azure or AWS. Why would someone go this route? The reason is many times companies have contracts in place to get discounted compute from 1 or 2 cloud providers. So, they sort of go all in with Microsoft Azure as an example. The legal and contract agreements are in place for the entire IT department to use ""whatever"" is in Azure. Well, if Nvidia cloud can be accessed in Azure that's great because all of the engineers and DS's can have access without going through and getting agreements in place for Nvidia directly.      There is obviously the chance of more cost but for the lack of headache it is probably negligible. But, every situation is different. Point is, that is money that is going directly to Nvidia (and probably the serving cloud provider at some portion) because at that point Microsoft or AWS or Google is only a passthrough. This is very much the same for other provider as well such as MongoDB and Redis Labs.      Now, on the other side Microsoft, X and AWS have every right to purchase, store and assemble their own solutions with purchased hardware from Nvidia and others and also provide and direct sale their own option.      See that's the difference of HARDWARE sales and CLOUD INCOME. I haven't heard this on the conference calls and would be great if someone talked about it because it would become so much more clear. You must understand the distinction to understand Nvidia's current business model right now.      Back to Gene. So the the mistake that everyone keeps making is that they're saying the BUST or the apocalypse MUST come for nvidia because once they sale all of the hardware then nobody is going to buy anymore. Thus the ""GLUT"".      That's not how this is working. You have to get your mind out of the Crypto/NFT ponzi scheme to understand this.      Crypto had a bunch of GPU's going up against a supply / demand model of increasing BitCoin price. When the bitcoin price crashed. Everyone holding a warehouse of GPU's costing millions in electricity suddenly didn't want to be a bitcoin miner anymore. Hence, a bunch of GPU's that nobody wanted. The ""GLUT"". This was probably max of Bitcoin falling to \~12000. It's also why ETH and others wanted to go to ASICS and get off the Bitcoin hype cycle.      Nobody talks about AWS or Azure or Google's ""GLUT"" concern with bought servers and hardware. Nobody. AWS and Azure update their cloud server options all of the time. It's a natural cycle that is smooth and calculated.      Why is it not conceivable that this will be similar for Nvidia?      Everyone is trying to predict the day Nvidia falls instead of trying to think ""hmm"" maybe, just maybe, Nvidia is growing as a cloud offering with software, hardware and service. Sound like IaaS? Because it is.      It's the same concept as general compute but with accelerated compute. The software stack is why you would go for Nvidia as opposed to using a different cloud provider native abstraction.      MongoDB in Azure Cosmos is not as good as MongoDB direct to Mongo IN Azure. Or at least that might be a consideration for you.      Speaking of Data storage companies one could make an analogy here.      Data gets stored and then you access said data.      LLM's get trained and then you access said LLM.      The only difference is that the LLM needs compute to run it. Less than training compute but still accelerated compute.      The training doesn't happen one time and that's it. You could train a model and it suck and then you have to retrain it. Or you need to update it so you have to retrain it.      The money it cost to train is in the million's. multiple millions of dollars for foundational LLM's.      There will be no more glut here than there is in any other cloud providers for general compute.      There will not be a ""BUST"" this time. So don't worry Dan, you can come out of the shorts and join the rest of us into the future.";"9";"2024-02-23T04:23:52"

People will completely seriously say that you can get a 1000% return investing in Nvidia because it's returned that much so far in a year. (not actual figures, just making a point. I don't remember how much Nvidia has gained).   How do these people see something (not just Nvidia, could be any company) gain so much in a short time and not feel even a little uneasy? It's a bit sad and concerning. Especially when you've seen some of them lose a lot of money in the stock market, then try and tell you it's a scam!   Edit: by the way, I'm not referring to outright scammers who say things like, invest in this and get these returns. I mean normal people who maybe got lucky or saw others getting lucky and genuinely believe what they're saying. Or they might also say something like, ""don't invest in s&p500, it's too safe.

Back then the bubble popped because companies didn't produce revenue to match the hype.  Today this seems different because some companies are making money hand over fist. However, the companies making money are those producing the infrastructure for AI, we have yet to see much revenue generated from AI itself. The similarity is that we are expecting AI itself to generate revenue similar to the startups of the first tech bubble.   Whether or not AI can generate revenue is a different topic. I'll simply say that the current expectations of AI don't match reality. Feel free to list the companies and products that leverage AI that are also generating significant revenue directly from that AI.  Nvidia makes chips, Microsoft and others use these chips to provide AI infrastructure, the bubble is in everyone trying to use this infrastructure to create products that derive revenue. If that revenue doesn't materialize, demand will drop for infrastructure and correspondingly for chips.  Nvidia, Microsoft, and others making money hand over fist is great for them, but it is not an indicator of the actual success of AI, only the attempt at success. Can anyone say Aeron chair?

A bet that the published results are accurate, unambiguous, and won't drastically change in the future, that the quality and motivation of the management will remain unchanged over a year, two, or five, etc.  Purchasing growth stocks is, by nature, a gamble.  Buffett's advice to speculators is undoubtedly wise: Remember who is really making money from your gambling—the House.  However, the simplicity and accessibility of market operations, which dismay the Maestro, have radically cheapened them. In his younger days, commissions were so high it's debatable when the House earned more, especially in relative terms.

I’ve been reading a lot more noise from the financial press about overheated values. So I tend to peruse the articles that give multiple sides or data supporting their claims.  There are lots of Nvidia mentions, of course. But pretty much any pan market analysis is going to mention Nvidia.  From Barron’s:  https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-rally-hottest-decades-1ca7bcf5  > The S&P 500 has had an extraordinary few months, any way you slice it. The index is up more than 25% from its October lows, and as Deutsche Bank Macro Strategist Henry Allen writes, “The current rally is almost unprecedented.”  > The index is now up 15 out of the past 17 weeks, a feat that’s only happened one other time in the past half-century, in 1989. If it notches yet another gain this week, for 16 out of 18, it would be the first time that’s happened since 1971.  > Such a massive rally—largely resting on enthusiasm about artificial intelligence and a few big tech stocks —has led to concerns that we might be in a tech stock bubble  > Nvidia revenue and profits are quite real and they are growing at an astonishing rate. It results last week, the latest in a series of blowout quarters, is “Unprecedented. And it speaks to the power and durability of this A.I. craze,” notes Rosenberg Research President Dave Rosenberg. “Nvidia’s stellar results and positive guidance hammered home the point of how generative AI is proving to be transformative in every respect  > And while Nvidia’s valuation may be easy to justify, the S&P 500 as a whole looks pricey: It is now trading at almost 22 times forward earnings. As Essaye points out, a price-to-earnings ratio around that level was “previously only reserved for periods of quantitative easing and 0% rates, not quantitative tightening and 5.37% fed funds.”  > Of course, skeptics haven’t been right yet. The average year-end price target for the S&P 500 as tracked by FactSet, of 5,556, implies more than 9% upside left for the year. RBC Capital Markets has also argued that the index looks capable of supporting a valuation of 23.55 times. There is also the possibility for a near-term pullback before gains continue. [**really? Is that possible??? /sarcasm**]  The numbers of the S&P are pretty startling to me. Kind of like when someone goes out in the basketball game and scores 60 points with 15 blocked shots.  But one problem with all these algorithms, and back testing, is the past is the past. While human behavior tends to return in cycles, buying and selling of companies and technology, that hadn’t existed before is hard to be cyclical.  Like I just read an article that the gardening nursery that had operated for 90 years in my home city was shutting down. It occupies 15 acres of unbelievably prime real estate, and they were using it to sell poinsettias and shrubs and trees to locals. This is to say: areas change, and businesses change and just because something operated, profitably, for 90 years doesn’t mean it’s going to operate for 100. We’ve seen the same with newspapers and magazines and comic books, and we’ve seen entire industries spring out of nothingness and become vast. Mobile games can rake in hundreds of millions of dollars. Popping virtual bubbles on a portable telephone he’s not a business model that existed when I was a kid. I doubt anyone even dreamed of it.  Sooo, the S&P setting records can be alarming. Alarming if things that happened in the financial markets past need to happen or are likely to happen now.  But sometimes things change sufficiently that the rules get thrown out. For all the talk of the past.com bubble, the boosters in 1999 were dead right in that the Internet changed everything. They were simply ahead by maybe five years, and things didn’t change so much that you could forgo earnings.   ";"0";"2024-02-27T21:53:53"

"Is it easy to “beat the market” now?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1burmr0/is_it_easy_to_beat_the_market_now/";"Short question, if you invest in the top tech companies, is it easy to beat the marketing meaning the S&P?  We’ve all heard the mantra “you’ll never beat the market” but is that really true any more or does the phrase need some sort of updating?  I’ve been investing for 15 years now and I think I be beat the market or at least the overall S&P500 every single year.  There might have been a year that I nominally missed but if you add up all my investments and look at the gains, it’s significantly higher than if I just invested in a boring S&P ETF.  My Fidelity account does this for me automatically and I’ve always been higher…for over a decade now.   So hear me out, I’ve made some dumb mistakes and lost $$$ along the way but my winners have always offset that. My game plan is pretty simple: always invest in large cap stocks.    With a diverse portfolio made up of Microsoft, Nvidia, Facebook (now meta), Amazon, Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, Amd, and a few others, I’ve found this sector completely destroys the overall “market.” Sure I have a few outliers like Home Depot and OLIN but when I look at my pie chart, it’s very aggressive and very heavily in tech.    The difference in the S&P vs the NASDAQ confirms this over the last 20 years or more and you could argue I’ve built my own sort of NASDAQ mutual fund in a ways, but I’m still beating the NASDAQ too.    The contrarian’s argument is that given enough time, my large cap tech picks will eventually falter and I will begin losing but at the amount I’m up right now, for over a decade, that correction would have to be astronomical and I don’t see how the whole world economy wouldn’t fall if these tech picks crash down 50% at once.    I’m not trying to brag or troll this group or anything like that.  I’m just genuinely interested to know if tech has made it relatively easy to now beat the overall market, and if so, what consequences does that have on the stability of the whole market if more investors start doing what I’m doing?    Is there a point where the “market” is all tech now?  It sure feels like the S&P is so heavily weighted by tech now that maybe that’s the real underlying answer to my question.

"1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/";"I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio.  As a recap, I bought several ‘pandemic stocks’ following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1\_year\_followup\_on\_buying\_the\_dip\_on\_pandemic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)  I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold.  Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss.  **Summary**  There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I’ve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3:  * Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% * Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% * Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% * Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% * Peloton (PTON): -71.51% * Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99%  All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD).  I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.  Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme).  **How I reinvested the proceeds**  The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA).  This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at \~$110/share in October 2022 (I don’t know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023.  Most analysts said it was overpriced and it’d have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation.  However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/). So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I passed on the [Arm IPO](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/14/technology/arm-ipo-stock-market.html), now down about 20% from its IPO peak.  I tentatively plan to give the 2-year update in another 6 months, plus or minus. For reference, the 1-year update from earlier this year is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1\_year\_followup\_on\_buying\_the\_dip\_on\_pandemic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)  **EDIT:** Corrected a typo to change 2021 to 2022.

When you see the numbers...      * Berkshire Hathaway is the 7th largest market capitalization, behind Nvidia, with a valuation of $790 billion. (In comparison, BlackRock, well-known to the general public, has a market capitalization of $105 billion.) * Berkshire Hathaway achieved $302 billion in revenue in 2022, a 9.37% increase from 2021. * BH has over $73 billion in cash reserves. * It holds stakes in companies like Coca Cola, Bank of America, and notably Apple, of which they own over 5%. It is basically an ETF (without dividends)     Warren Buffett is one of the world's best fund managers. He has some basic principles that we should all use:  * Invest only in businesses you understand, with favorable long-term prospects, led by competent management, and at reasonable prices. * Look for a long-term competitive advantage in a stable industry. * Seek exceptional companies at reasonable prices, not mediocre companies at bargain prices.        The Risks I see:     * The company's past performance has been incredible, but its current size will inevitably slow down its performance.  * Warren Buffet is 93 years old. What is going to happen to BH when he die ? Even that seems ok: It's known that Howard Buffet will be the future Chairman and Greg Abel the future CEO when Warren is no longer around. Greg Abel shares the same basic principles of management and investment as Warren Buffett. * Lastly, Warren Buffet is not exposed to Green and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) topics.

Apologies if this has already been posted in this community.   I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ.  https://archive.is/20231009181337/https://www.wsj.com/articles/picking-a-stock-for-the-year-2048-66d90e  The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.  So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold.   So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049.   Here is my list so far.   1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 ) 2. Costco 3. Johnson and Johnson 4. Waste Management 5. CVS 6. Home Depot 7. Boeing 8. Caterpillar 9. GE Aerospace 10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia 11. Walmart/Target 12. Starbucks / McDonalds 13. UPS 14. JP Morgan / Bank of America 15. Berkshire / Markel 16. Disney 17. Tesla / GM 18. Hershey 19. Dollar General 20. Lockheed Martin  Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate.   Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.  Edit: Some really good points in the comments.   1. Most of my regular investing goes to VOO. Think of this as a fun little experiment  2.

Point 1: So, first of all, there are two ways a person can make money off a stock: Either through dividends, or having the stock appreciate in value, and then selling it. Am I right to say that?  Let’s look at stocks without dividends.   Point 2: A stock’s price is ultimately moved only by supply and demand. It doesn’t matter how successful a company is. At the end of the day, a stock’s price will only go up if there is demand for the stock. Am I right to say that?  Point 3: People buy stocks in hopes of the stock price increasing, but a stock’s price only increases when people buy the stock.   With point 3 in mind, it leads to my final question, what drives the demand for stock in the first place?

Seems like Zoomers are breaking up with online dating, preferring the old-school charm of meeting in person.     *YTD Share Performance of Major Dating Apps:*   \- Grindr: +25%   \- Match Group: -28%   \- Bumble: -32%   \- Spark Networks: -98%     **Take-Aways:** I’m no expert on the dating apps (I’ve been with my wife since I was a pimple-faced school boy) but think there is a broader theme that investors need to be cautious of: that things trendy with the twentysomethings can evaporate quite quickly.     *Performance Since IPO of Select 'Trendy Stocks':*   \- Snapchat: -58%   \- Robinhood: -77%   \- GoPro: -91%   \- Allbirds: -97%   \- Blue Apron: -99%     Companies like GoPro and Snapchat were all extremely popular at one time but things change - and often quickly. A key term for investors is that of a ‘moat’: characteristics ingrained in your business model that makes it hard for competitors or copy-cats to come along and steal your market share. While things like a company’s ‘brand’ can be an example of a moat, ‘popularity’ isn’t the same thing. Brands are built over years from their connection to things like quality (Volvo), trustworthiness (Wall Street Journal) or coolness (Hermes).     *Examples of Economic Moats:*     * **Low-Cost Producers:** Provide a low cost that is usually based on significant economies of scale. Examples include Walmart, Southwest, FedEx. * **High Switching Costs:** Material expense (money, time, effort) required in order to move to competitor. Examples include Salesforce, Oracle, Microsoft. * **Network Effect:** Value to customer increases with the number of people on the platform. Examples include Ebay, Uber, Reddit. * **Intangible Assets:** Brand names, intellectual property, trade secrets, government approvals. Examples include Pfizer, Nvidia, Coca-Cola.     Moreover, often these companies that achieve near overnight success do so because their business doesn’t require significant time, expense or technological sophistication in order to reach such a scale. Looking at the companies I've mentioned, in nearly every case some smart folks with a laptop can replicate their business model: improve on it: and steal their customers. In essence, the things that can be built quickly, are often built on sand.   ";"312";"2023-11-13T18:46:24"

"China Urges EV Makers to Buy Local Chips as US Clash Deepens";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1bffne0/china_urges_ev_makers_to_buy_local_chips_as_us/";"What implications do you think will this have for US and EU semiconductor manufacturers? Any insights how much substitution Chinese chipmakers can actually realistically achieve? (I was under the impression they wouldn't be able to but perhaps things have changed).  **China Urges EV Makers to Buy Local Chips as US Clash Deepens**  - *Directive could hurt Nvidia, NXP and other EV chip suppliers* - *Order is a response to US efforts to curb Chinese chip tech*  The Chinese government has quietly asked electric-vehicle makers from BYD Co. to Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. to sharply increase their purchases from local auto chipmakers, part of a campaign to reduce reliance on Western imports and boost China’s domestic semiconductor industry.  The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology asked carmakers this year to expand their buying of homegrown components to accelerate the adoption of Chinese chips, according to people familiar with the matter. The country’s tech overseer previously set an informal target for automakers to source a fifth their chips locally by 2025, but has grown dissatisfied with the pace of progress, the people said.  The ministry is now directly instructing firms to avoid foreign semiconductors if at all possible, said the people, who asked to remain anonymous discussing sensitive information. That means overseas chip firms effectively have to manufacture their silicon through a local foundry such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. or Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd., one of the people said. During a recent tender conducted by a major domestic brand, one foreign bidder failed to secure a contract despite offering a price they estimated was 30% lower than the eventual winner, another person said.  The developments reflect Beijing’s stepped-up efforts to galvanize its own tech sector, a response to US attempts to curtail Chinese chip development via sanctions and restrictions on the sale of advanced technology. The Chinese directive on cars casts uncertainty over the business of companies from Nvidia Corp. and NXP Semiconductor NV to Renesas Electronics Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc., which compete with local firms to supply the world’s largest EV market.  Shares in European chipmakers that supply Chinese EV firms fell in early European trading. Infineon Technologies AG slid as much as 4.8%, while STMicroelectronics NV slid 2.2%.  Many local brands buy a hodge-podge of other components from power management chips to microcontrollers and display ICs. Some carmakers from leader BYD to upstarts like Nio Inc. rely on Nvidia processors for instance to coordinate functions in their hyper-connected cars.  The MIIT didn’t respond to a faxed request for comment. BYD, Nio and Geely representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment.  Beijing is increasingly intent on supporting a domestic chip industry it knows is lagging well behind foreign rivals, but critical to supporting the economy and maintaining a geopolitical advantage. The directive is in line with pledges this year to mobilize all means at its disposal to wrest technological supremacy from the US and other nations.  The central government may also be bracing for curbs in the auto sector specifically.  Washington is probing potential data and cyber-security risks posed by internet-connected cars from China, including EVs. US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has expressed concern that data collected by the cars could wind up in Beijing’s hands, and is overseeing an investigation that could result in restrictions on the sale of those cars in the US — measures that would go beyond a potential increase in tariffs.  A mandate in favor of Chinese chips also raises the prospect of further retaliation as Washington ramps up its containment campaign.  At the Two Sessions meeting of lawmakers this month, Beijing hammered home a longstanding goal to break an American stranglehold on key spheres. Under Xi Jinping’s watch, China has expanded state control of strategically critical areas from semiconductor manufacturing to quantum computing.  Against that backdrop, Beijing has endorsed the efforts of local champions such as Huawei Technologies Co. through subsidies and targeted policies. It’s now establishing a $27 billion-plus fund to drive chip investments and hiking spending on nationwide research to more than $51 billion.  China’s biggest auto chip and software providers include Huawei, Loongson Technology Corp., GigaDevice Semiconductor Inc. and Wingtech Technology Co. Many, like Novosense Microelectronics Co. and StarPower Semiconductor Ltd., have built significant capacity in so-called mature or lower-end nodes. The MIIT’s policy may soak up some of that capacity — at the expense of their foreign rivals.  The US and its European allies, meanwhile, have grown alarmed by China’s rush into older-generation chips. The Biden administration is mulling tariffs on those components in addition to other trade tools, but has said it is not considering restricting them using export controls.  While US rules introduced in 2022 slowed China’s development of advanced chipmaking capabilities, they left largely untouched the country’s ability to use techniques older than 14-nanometers. That has led Chinese firms to construct new plants faster than anywhere else in the world. They are forecast to build 26 fabs through 2026 that use 200-millimeter and 300-mm wafers, according to data from the trade group SEMI as of 2023. That compares with 16 fabs for the Americas.  **Source:** https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-15/china-urges-byd-ev-makers-to-buy-chinese-chips-as-tensions-with-us-escalate";"60";"2024-03-15T15:46:40"

Currently, I own 50 shares of NVDA valued at around $30,000, purchased back in 2017 at $34 per share, with a cost basis of $1,700. This stock has seen unbelievable growth since then of over 1600% and now constitutes 45% of my non-taxable investment account and roughly 20% of all my investment accounts, excluding my home.  Last year, I sold about $5000 worth of NVDA to diversify, but I'm torn about what to do next. On one hand, the stock has been on a tear, and their future looks extremely promising with AI advancements and the huge demand for chips going forward. However, I'm aware of the need to diversify, as well as the risk of the stock taking a massive downturn and significantly hurting my net worth. There are also tax considerations if I sell, since I'll be on the hook for some significant capital gains tax.   For some context, I'm a married man with two kids, a house with $200k in equity and a $200k mortgage. I have around $80k in IRA accounts and $65k in taxable brokerage accounts amd some cash on hand for emergency fund etc. Little debt otherwise.   Any advice on whether to sell and diversify, ways to mitigate risks, or hedging strategies would be greatly appreciated. How should I navigate this situation, considering the potential tax bill, its outsized share of my portfolio and the promising future for NVDA?

"In my humble opinion, Generative A.I. is the most idiotic bubble I’ve seen so far.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1axfxsm/in_my_humble_opinion_generative_ai_is_the_most/";"There was the generalized Internet bubble of the 1990s, in which any company that added a .com to its name would see its shares skyrocket. Then came the Web 2.0 / social media bubble of the 2000s, and cloud in the 2010s.   Compared to recent “new technological paradigms,” Generative A.I. seems to have the narrowest use cases, is prone to errors/hallucinations, and is not even a novel concept. Benzinga has been publishing A.I.-generated articles regarding stock price movements, analyst estimates, earnings results, etc. for years before the marketing buzzword “generative A.I.“ became mainstream. You can tell they’re A.I.-generated because they follow a cookie-cutter template and provide few novel insights. I’ve been thoroughly unimpressed with the essays generated by ChatGPT & the like: not only do they contain occasional errors (hallucinations), they’re far from the quality of papers written by competent humans. ChatGPT might be useful for below-average university students to get by, but I don’t see how its use cases are a $10 trillion+ market. For now, seemingly every Fortune 500 company has jumped on the A.I. bandwagon, as simply mentioning A.I. on investor calls automatically leads to increased valuations.  Big Tech is extremely skilled at selling hype & FOMO through a new buzz word every few years. I’m just wondering how long this mania might last before it deflates, as previous manias always do. I imagine first, the non-tech companies paying NVIDIA & the like billions of dollars for A.I. chips & data centers would realize the economic/profit gain from Generative A.I. is not as large as forecasted. Then eventually, it hits the tech companies selling the shovels. But this could take years to play out.

I'm curious about the investment strategy of buying high when it's a good company.  For examples, look at Microsoft, Amazon, Eli Lilly, and Nvidia.  All at very high points.  Hitting new all time highs even.  In theory, my heart says if you truly believe in the company and that the stock will go up, then buying high isn't a problem.  But my brain is just like, NO, it'll clearly go down.  You never buy high lol.  So what do YOU all do?  Do you have a favorite stock that you buy more of no matter how high it gets? Or do you just enjoy the ride with what you have and look for something else to invest in?  I do have some small positions in those four companies, which is why I'm familiar with them. Clearly I'm comfortable enough with them to hold the shares I have. But my brain is just so wired to not buy high at peaks.  I've read a decent amount of different strategies and things to look for, but I've never really seen anything about a successful company and buying high.  I know it could be a little subjective too. Depends on your age and risk tolerance and things like that and what you are looking for, but I guess I'm just trying to go for a more General approach in this question. But in an effort to help if people want, I'm mid 30s, married, kids on the way. Have a good job and not worry about retirement. My personal investing is to try to Simply make money for me and the family for stuff like trips and fixing the house and things like that, so risk tolerance is fairly high.

Just trying to familiarize myself with some of the most talked about investment opportunities in the market right now as well as potential stock picks for each. Feel free to correct any info here or add on more. Just looking to start a discussion on the different hot topics lately and the following stock picks that go along with them! I know there are several other big opportunities like weed,crypto,etc just didn’t wanna go overboard  **Lithium ( MALRY, LAC)**The booming EV market, along awith the growing demand for renewable energy storage, positions lithium as a key investment opportunity. Major automaker's substantial investments in EVs drive the need for lithium-ion batteries, while the increasing focus on sustainable energy ensures a sustained demand for lithium. Despite global lithium deposits, the challenge of securing a stable and cost-effective supply persists, presenting investment potential in companies involved in lithium exploration, mining, and battery production.  **GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, INTL )**Demand for GPUs comes from AI and machine learning for handling big data in areas like healthcare and finance. Data centers need GPUs for cloud computing as businesses shift operations online. In the gaming industry, GPUs are crucial for high-quality graphics in video games. Cryptocurrency mining, particularly for coins like Ethereum, relies on GPUs for their processing power. Overall, the demand is driven by the growing need for high-performance GPUs in AI, data centers, gaming, and cryptocurrency mining.  **Uranium (BHP, NXE )**The demand for uranium primarily stems from its crucial role in fueling nuclear power generation. As global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources intensify, the demand for nuclear energy has been on the rise, particularly in emerging economies like China and India. This growing demand, coupled with supply constraints and geopolitical factors affecting uranium production, creates a decent investment opportunity.

Now I am wondering: Should I switch the investment strategy on my ""regular"" account from passive ETF investments to swing-trading individual stocks as well?

"Just how big are the Magnificent Seven?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19az17m/just_how_big_are_the_magnificent_seven/";"This is a big quote from MarketWatch. I’ve seen the numbers before, but this really gave me pause.   > These captains of the SS S&P 500 are Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. They've been described as the magnificent seven by many news organizations. Fortunately for me, there's a common thread among this group. They are the only U.S. companies that have ever been valued at a trillion dollars by the public markets. To say these companies are dominating the S&P 500 is a giant understatement. Last year, their collective valuation gained more than $5 trillion. Compare that to the S&P 500's valuation gain of less than $8 trillion. That means the trillionaires were responsible for roughly 65% of the Index's market cap gain last year, despite comprising just 1.4% of its components. But doesn't this go against the main reason behind investing in S&P 500 index funds? Wouldn't the entire index be susceptible to a massive drop if just one of these seven companies failed?  > Phil Van Dorn: Well, I like index funds because they spread out your risk over many stocks and because the expenses are so low. In the mutual fund industry, traditionally, you might be looking at expenses of 1% of assets under management per year, and that can really pile up over time. But with an S&P 500 Index Fund, your expenses get close to zero. But as you have mentioned when you called the group of expensive stocks the Trillionaires' Club, a small group of companies now make up between 27 and 30% of the S&P 500 depending on which day you look at it.  > Jeremy Owens: Right, so that's seven out of 500 companies accounting for more than a quarter or less than a third of the entire market cap of the S&P 500 and really swaying the underlying metrics. What should an investor kind of take from this and how should we look at the S&P 500 moving forward, knowing how much these companies matter?  > Phil Van Dorn: One can say that there's a heck of a lot of risk in the seven companies that make up only 1% of the S&P 500, but make up close to a third of its value. However, the S&P 500 is self-correcting. It rewards success.";"27";"2024-01-20T01:51:08"
"Wheel Strategy Idea: Super itm";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/16l067x/wheel_strategy_idea_super_itm/";"So, I've been doing some thinking/analysis about the wheel strategy. Some appeals to it are the guaranteed premiums it brings in, the relatively small risk it has, and the ability to be flexible in most markets (assuming you're wheeling a good stock).   Usually, you try to sell your initial put otm for a chance at more later and to not get assigned at an ""upcharge."" Some people are able to make this their full time job. Here's what I've been thinking: What if you were to sell the put way itm? With enough collateral (I played around with the numbers) you could take a year's salary in the form of one premium on a single, week-long put. You would obviously be assigned, but you'd have an entire year to make up the difference by selling cc's, the stock going up, and dividends. Selling super safe calls (staying way itm) every week should in theory be enough to cover the ""salary"" as well as churn a profit for most of the stocks I analyzed (Nvidia, Apple, even VOO). And to me, it seems even safer than buying and holding, due to the ""salary"" being instant.   Is this the GOAT of trading? Or does this belong in r/wallstreetbets?";"0";"2023-09-17T15:04:48"

"Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1apur6l/looking_at_historical_data_does_it_show_that_this/";"Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market? I say that by looking at the data. For example. Amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. That is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself, but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. Also I have another example. Nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. The margins are high but obviously companies like Meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent GPU solutions to control costs, and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. The same is looking at arm. Arm which trades at like 150 x earnings, or something crazy, literally grows at like 28 percent. That means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity.  Then, if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004, Apple, it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth, a tiny market cap, better leadership. This compared to the 2000's investing environment or earlier is terrible, yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want.     It goes on and on. Looking at Palantir which trades at a crazy multiple, or basically any software company, yes it's possible to buy Palantir or any stock and it triple, but trying to get earnings at a good multiple in other words, Real INVESTING seems to be literally impossible right now.     Even the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like Alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline.      And there are questions like how is this possible and is this partly due to extremely irresponsible Fed reserve activity mainly due to QE pushing valuations to their highest levels ever. Also do the people here think that this is the worst investing environment ever when compared to historical pe ratios?";"0";"2024-02-13T15:28:31"

Assume this scenario:   \- Mid 30’s.   \- Saving \~100k per year.   \- Current portfolio is several hundred thousand. 2/3 in cash 1/3 in VFV.   \- Wanting to “retire” in 6-8 years with \~$3,500/month in dividend income.  The thing I care about most is monthly cashflow. I’m not hugely concerned with overall capital appreciation as long as my monthly income is enough to cover living expenses. For instance, if I can have a \~8% yield on cost on $750,000 I’m fine with that, rather than spending time building to 1.5M yielding 4%.  I want a simple ETF system I can continuously plug excess cash into to keep growing monthly income.Rather than investing purely in more growth oriented ETFs, I’m thinking of focusing mostly on Canadian and USA dividend aristocrat tracking ETFs with decent dividend growth rates, and just building that up with DRIP and new contributions over the next several years.Attached are some images that represent my estimated numbers.  I would be interested to hear your opinions on this strategy, rather than investing for capital growth, focus more on dividend growth over a medium time horizon.  My portfolio would hold ETFs like CDZ, HYLD, VEQT, XEI, and perhaps some VFV. If you look at the rough math, even the capital appreciation works out similar to a growth focus when you factor in DRIP. On top of that, if stocks go down, then DRIP just buys more for the money, increasing overall income.  Is there anything I’m missing or not considering?

They own about 8% at the moment (down from 35% in the past)  **MOAT**  After a thorough analysis, I concluded that Inmode has a **narrow MOAT** meaning they have a competitive advantage in **manufacturing** (by outsourcing it which makes their business capital-light compared to competitors). Their only other competitive advantage is **distribution**. They sell to 92 countries at the moment. Each country has its own regulations (FDA) and hoops to jump through before being able to sell.  **Capital allocation strategy**  Inmode boasts a **very high historical return on invested capital** (200%) and incremental invested capital. They have earned well above their cost of capital. They are piling up cash and have an employee incentive program that is dilutive. In 2022, for the first time, they **bought back shares** to offset this dilution. They claim to actively look for acquisition, but it will be difficult when looking at how high their margins are.  **Industry**  This is a **competitive** industry with a lot of players. When comparing profitability in the industry, Inmode is the most profitable company in the space. Overall, the industry is barely creating value.   **Impact of the current conflict**  Inmode HQ and manufacturing suppliers are located in the north of Israel where it is calmer. They claim to have about 3 quarters of supplies in stock in case of a supply problem.  **Investment thesis**  ***The good***  * At the current price, the market is expecting a **no-growth scenario** (based on an inverse DCF model) * I consider this to be an **overreaction** * Their business model (sales of platforms) is **strengthening** by an increase of the sales in consumables * I think there is an **asymmetry** here based on the recent price drop  ***The bad***  * They haven't been shareholder-friendly in the past * Significant reduction in insider ownership  **Possible catalysts**  * Future **share buybacks** or acquisitions * The use of Ozempic leads to loose skin leads to Inmode's solution * **Growth** in other areas: women's wellness and ocular treatment  I've tried to summarize my 30-page deep dive. I'm looking for feedback that breaks this thesis.  Thank you.  &#x200B:";"4";"2023-10-20T15:29:43"

"Industries with Blue Chip Growth stocks that aren't tech ?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/16ve56l/industries_with_blue_chip_growth_stocks_that/";"My personal portfolio is heavily weighted on Tech. I have been risk averse, so most of it is in Blue Chip Tech companies who are well positioned to take advantage of the upcoming technological revolutions but also have solid revenue making product moats. (MSFT, AAPL). I also have a HUGE unvested position in the AI revolution. So no more money in AI for me.  As I look towards diversifying my portfolio, I am struggling to find any industry that also meets the following demands:  * Solid products that will make money today and 50 years from now * Sane P/E ratios (Keep it under 50 at least) * Poised to take advantage of one of the upcoming technological revolutions (ie. can expand their market) * Hard to beat Moat  The other industries that seem to have strong potential are the kind that have been losing money through the likes of Cathy Woods different ARK ETFs. All of Genomics, Drug Development, Space, 3D printing etc. are bleeding money by double digit percentages every year. Manufacturing companies are slowly revolutionizing, but I don't see their market expanding in a fashion that lets their stocks explode. Many others like mining & energy seem to be so heavily regulated, that your investment is more a reflection of trust in the political class than the actual industry.   The compute hardware industry makes sense to me, but I am already invested in non-Nvidia players and it is too close to Tech anyway. Novo Nordisk satisfied all those requirements, and I was planning on investing in it in January. Dragged my feet with it, and the train has passed.  I can take risks. I am already maxing out my 401ks with safe index funds and I am 30 with my responsibilities paid off. But, don't say Crypto or weed-stocks. I have already been burned on both. I still maintain some crypto, but I am not changing my position on that. Either it all sinks or goes somewhere. Not an extra dollar in or out. Also, no Elon Musk companies please. Meme stocks aren't investments, it's gambling.  To me, genomics, drones (military) and surveillance are going to explode 10x at least in the next 10 years. I know founders in each of them, and have a strong intuition for the base technology. Not approaching it from a 'shiny new thing' perspective. But they are all so regulated and intertwined with Govts, that it is impossible to know who to put money on.";"17";"2023-09-29T17:07:21"
"What are your thoughts on Qualcomm?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/13vwlb5/what_are_your_thoughts_on_qualcomm/";"All,  Have been following and holding Qualcomm for about 2 years now. I know that smartphones is a cyclical industry and is currently in a slump. Qualcomm still has high inventory issues and have guided another quarter of falling revenues and earnings.  Having said that, **Qualcomm's intrinsic value based on DCF is around $156** https://valueinvesting.io/QCOM/valuation/dcf-growth-exit-5y  It is diversifying beyond smartphones and is aggressively pursuing automotive and IoT markets.  It also released a new chip that brings AI to smartphones. While the applications are limited to battery monitoring and camera improvements (hardware based) right now, they can easily move to other areas of enhancements.   Regarding loss of revenues from Apple, it will still take Apple 3-4 years to phase out existing devices that use Qualcomm chips. The 5 billion revenue Qualcomm gets from Apple will be covered by IoT + automotive by then.  Lastly, people can only delay buying a smartphone, not avoid it completely, especially buying high end phones. Which means once the slump is over, Qualcomm will make a very strong comeback.  Any thoughts? I want to buy more but would love to hear some critical arguments in the mean time.  Edit: Qualcomm's also making PC chips. Remains to be seen if they can eat Intel's lunch like AMD.  https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/qualcomm-claims-laptops-destroy-intel-chips-in-ai/";"12";"2023-05-30T19:33:52"

My wife (28F) and I (35M) are going to be diversifying from apple and would love your opinions. I will give a brief background about us and also our financial situation.   My wife is finishing her masters program in the spring of 24 and will be making about 100k a year. She will have about 70k in student debt. I am in tech and earn about 175-250k with zero debt. We have 1 daughter who is 3 years old. We live in a HCOL area in Northern California and fortunately have a paid off residence.   The allocations below are held in a trust which took a 90k loss last year and gives us the opportunity to reduce allocation % in apple. Essentially we will be selling 90,000 in capital gains (roughly 690+ shares) and diversifying.   (Trust) Apple shares - 3,250 ($572,975) Shwab CD - $125,000 (4.1% & expiring in October 2023)  Cash - 14.5k  Personal brokerage  Apple shares - 620 ($109,306) Nvidia shares - 15 ($6,720 Tesla - 10 ($2,670) 529 account - ($4,000) VTI - $22,420 (Roth ira) 401k - $101,000 (VTSAX) Cash - 35k  Our Schwab advisor is pushing for a self directed index through Schwab. The Schwab advisor  wants us to harvest losses in the future so we can diversify apple to even out the allocations. Minimum investment amount is 100k into this self directed index fund. Our longLong term goal is wanting to have a 10-15% allocation in apple.   My question to the group is, what should my next step be? I’m a little skeptical about a self directed index fund because it’s a Schwab robo advisor with .4% fees. Should i just sell 75% of the entire trust and VTI or VOO it? We are very fortunate to be in this situation but are losing sleep at night with everything in 1 stock.   Thank you in advance!";"0";"2023-09-18T22:52:56"
"Do Quants Rule the Markets?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/13wi8xf/do_quants_rule_the_markets/";"While most were bracing for a correction due to bank failures and commercial real estate issues, quant funds went against the grain, buying up stocks rather than selling or shorting. As a result, instead of economic unrest, we saw consistent market indices.  Deutsche Bank [reports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-are-markets-so-calm-its-revenge-of-the-quant-funds-26a93425?mod=rss_markets_main) that quant funds' net share of US assets reached their highest levels since December 2021. Coupled with active corporate stock buybacks, the S&P 500 has swayed less than 1% in either direction for 36 out of the last 46 sessions.  So, what's the mechanism here?  As volatility subsides, quants press 'Buy.' This happened when regulators intervened to prevent a banking crisis, and the Fed indicated an end to rate hikes.  Here you might be asking yourself, “but when the **VIX** surges, shouldn’t funds counterintuitively reduce their positions?”  Theoretically, yes. Practically, however, no.  Take the May 2019 market crash, when the S&P 500 dropped by around 7% amid panic over the US-China trade war. McElligott estimates quants jettisoned $35 billion worth of stocks within a month.  Of course, you probably noticed that the VIX crossed 20 twice in May. So…why no crash?  First, we don't fully understand quant fund algorithms.  Second, retail investor backing has grown.  Additionally, last week's favorable Nvidia report played its role. The total market cap of AI-related firms swelled by nearly $100 billion in a day.  If all of this is true, then when will the long-awaited correction occur?  Corrections often come when market confidence is high and a 'bullish trend' appears all but irreversible. Once investors start buying every dip, convinced that a surge is imminent...that's usually when the rug gets pulled out from under them—not when everyone is on high alert, shorting left and right, but when they aren’t.";"1";"2023-05-31T12:22:07"

It’s more than just the ‘Magnificent Seven.’ This euphoria seems to be lifting up all of the sectors and a majority of the industries and stocks.”  > The rally may have been sparked by Nvidia's blowout earnings on Wednesday, but it spread well beyond the AI behemoth. Three sectors hit new highs this past week—tech, healthcare, and industrials. Financials and materials are less than 5% away from their peaks. Costco Wholesale, which sells more corn chips than microchips, is at a record too.   **S&P 500 Sector	Gain during week ended Feb. 23**  * Consumer Staples	2.1%  * Information Technology	2%  * Materials	1.9%  * Industrials	1.8%  * Financials	1.6%  * Consumer Discretionary	1.54%  * Health Care	1.51%  * Communication Services	1.49%  * Utilities	1.2%  * Real Estate	0.9%  * Energy	0.4%  > Most of the market’s 25% gain since late October was premised on the idea that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates starting in March—or May at the very latest. Recent comments from members of the Fed, along with signs of persistent inflation, suggest that the first cut could come in June or even later. Hopes for as many as seven rate cuts this year have faded away. **At some point, rate cuts will matter again.**  > The percentage of S&P 500 constituents trading above their 50-day moving average climbed to more than 67% on Friday, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

"1 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/";"Last year there was a post asking what folks were doing to profit from the current/upcoming recession on Hacker News: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33040211](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33040211)  I replied ([https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33041751](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33041751)) that I purchased some pandemic stocks, which I started doing in April 2022. Most of my purchasing was through summer 2022, but I've bought others more recently, like Carvana on the dip in December (which luckily popped since it became a meme stock), as well as Meta, Amazon and Google on the dips in October. The most recent was Allbirds on the dip in March since I had just purchased the shoes and they quickly became my favorite.  Overall, I'm up 36%, but as you can imagine a few winners (which I luckily have larger stakes in) make up for the losers. My target timeline is \~3 years, and we could still see a deeper recession from a hard landing, so I plan to post more annual updates.  There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I've summarized each with the overall unrealized gain/loss so far as of this morning:  * Affirm: -11.33% * Amazon: +25.25% * Allbirds: +9.43% * Coinbase: -34.32% * Carvana: +306.5% * Google: +29.35% * Meta: +170.89% * Cloudflare: +14.35% * Netflix: +97.08% * Peloton: -54.61% * Roblox: +25.14% * Shopify: +39.26% * Snapchat: +3.21% * Snowflake: +11.14% * Unity: +8.91%  **Some commentary**  It's hard to convey how much of a roller coaster the the last 12 months have been, with some pretty large negative swings that I just had to watch and not react to. There are likely more to come, especially since it seems a lot of the potential good news is already priced in.  Interestingly, in that post I mentioned Peloton was one I regretted almost instantly, and is now my worst performer by far. Unfortunately, greed got the best of me and I caught that falling knife buying a few times as the stock dropped further. I was hoping they would get rid of the excess inventory, improve distribution and double down on subscriptions to turn things around, but that hasn't materialized. Maybe it still will, or they get acquired.  Despite the strong gains, I still feel Shopify (improved focus, strong brand), Netflix (new ad tier, other new streaming services struggling and likely to go back to content), and Meta (improved targeting post privacy changes + AI opportunities) still have good upside potential.  I also really like Microsoft due to their enterprise moat and opportunities with AI, but their stock never had the correction the other stocks did and that was the scent I was chasing at the time (right or wrong). But long-term, I also wonder if AI will negate the need for human productivity software since the AI can just do it and review/edit mode requires less bloat (e.g. video with Final Cut Pro vs. TikTok, or images with Photoshop vs. Instagram). I wouldn't doubt if we see an AI-native productivity suite that doesn't just integrate AI, but predicated on simplfy reviewing AI generated content.  I'm disappointed to have missed Nvidia (up 3X since October) since I used to own it and have been watching it since the crypto bust created excess inventory and a predictable dip, then the AI trend led to the recovery. The valuation feels rich, but could easily grow into it given the trajectory of AI, unless the hyperscalers make their own chips.  Perhaps counterintuitively, it seems it's more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts than financial analysts/stock pickers since, at the end of the day, you need to make your own decisions about the fundamentals and prospects of the business. Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but by definition backward looking while valuation is forward looking.  I'm curious to see how these perform if the US enters a broader recession in the next 18 months. I don't plan to sell unless something catastrophic happens and I see a better opportunity to shift to.  **Update \~6mo later here:** https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15\_year\_followup\_on\_buying\_the\_dip\_on\_pandemic/";"173";"2023-06-12T21:18:14"

But I do have maybe 10-15% in single stocks, just to satisfy the inner (wannabe) Buffett.  So we've all heard the advice that diversification is important when building a portfolio. Correct me if wrong, but this can mean across different stocks, or by diversifying across assets, like stocks and real estate.   I was looking for some online calculator that could find the correlation between two stocks and found this:  https://www.buyupside.com/calculators/stockcorrelationinput.php  It lets you put two stocks and the time period to calculate the correlation between.   Could something like this be used just as a rudimentary tool. Either to see how whether you're actually as diversified as you think or to see you're not over concentrating in one area. Like investing in 5 different popular tech giants, which seems to be a thing some people do.   However, some results I found were a bit strange so not sure if that means using figures like these are not so useful? Eg, apple and Goldman Sachs had a correction of 0.8585 over the past 5 years and 0.9058 over the last 10 years. Or Nvidia and PepsiCo also having a correlation just over 0.85.   Are these figures just because stocks have generally all gone up over these time periods so the end result would be that mathematically they are correlated? Even though they are completely different industries/business models?  So can mathemical concepts/figures like these be useful, or do they not mean much since they are backwards looking, and it's better to diversify by knowledge of the different businesses. Such as, we might say intuitively that Apple and PepsiCo should be uncorrelated, no matter what price history suggests?  A final thought I'd like to hear opinions on, would be choosing from different industries based on the most diversification available.   Eg, you pick Microsoft and apple in the tech sector (not in your portfolio, just as two options available) and PG and PEP in, not sure the exact industry name, but say consumer products? You've done whatever prior research you saw fit to arrive at these businesses and now want to narrow things down for whatever reason.   And then have a 2*2 matrix with the different correlations between pairs. If there is a pair that might have significantly lower correlation than the other three, maybe you could pick that? Or is this still not very useful?";"1";"2024-01-07T22:43:24"
"What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awi9lb/whats_the_role_and_future_of_intel_in_taiwans/";"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys.  From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business.  From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm.  If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in *a lot* more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel.  Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes.  [I'm reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/165c0mq/they_would_not_listen_to_us_inside_arizonas/) that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended.  But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive.  Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's *a lot* I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.";"2";"2024-02-21T18:44:41"
"Risks of investing in ETP (Exchange Traded Products) compared to CFDs and futures?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b5cq85/risks_of_investing_in_etp_exchange_traded/";"Update: After reading some articles and examples Daily ETP have Stop-Loss in them unfortunately... This means that long ETP would trigger a SL if the underlying stock drops \~16.6% in a single day. So that's how the ETP originators earn money.    Hello Everyone,  Why are retail traders not completely ignoring CFD trades and going all in on low priced leveraged ETPs (pennies)?  Example is GraniteShares 3x Long AMD Daily ETC (3LAM.L) currently just 2.74$  We all know that chances are AMD will be more valuable in a year compared to now, as the AI hype wouldn't die in a year. There is too much market share to be taken away from Nvidia and the market doesn't even have too - the demand is currently way higher than the supply, so it's only a plus! The issue with futures and CFDs are that you pay fees, have stop loss and need to know very precisely how much and in which direction the market will move between the opening and closing of your position. With ETP you don't care, as you don't have daily fees or stop loss and inflation is your friend, as generally more money will be put into the profitable stocks sooner or later due to rising expenses and thus prices.  This ETP has made 20.1% in a day while AMD 5.25%  The NVDA equivalent has made from 6$ to 150$ in just a year. Using x5 leverage maybe could provide that return, but at a MASSIVE risk. How likely was it to lose money from NVDA 1 year ago by buying this ETP at just 6$? Similar ETPs for the other tech companies are already trading at far higher ranges than just 2-3$.  For some reason this Google ETP 3LAL hasn't reach it's ATH although currently GOOG is trading around ATH. I guess it has to do with when the ETP starts trading on the market or maybe it doesn't monitor stock splits/dillutions.  I am wondering who is on the other sides of those ETP trades? You cannot convince me that people are shorting 3LAM while it's at a silly 2.74$ (was around 0.3$ when AMD was 80$) and AMD just recently started it's AI hyped bull run. Sure it already made around 300% in a year, but so did NVDA and AMD started from way lower market cap! I was actually shorting NVDA around 500-600$ range, as I didn't do any due diligence on it's main product behind everything :( - the Tensor A100 and how many orders were for it etc.  Please try to give me arguments why 3LAM would be a bad investment to buy and hold for 1 year if AMD - besides AMD getting priced less than 202$ per share? The fees is around 0.3% per trade without any daily fees from what I could tell.  Another example is 3LVW if you think Volkswagen will recover (I do) :). It has massive debt, but pays 8% in dividends.  Disclaimer - I put have put my money where my mouth is, but I stay open to corrections about my understandings, as I have been proven very wrong recently about AMZN and why it's valued this high.  Why is math not working in some cases? Microstrategy did around x10 increase in a single year. The ETP did around 10 000 times increase?!  3LMI went from 0.01$ to 337.71$ - it seems like the starting price is the biggest factor, as this is not just x30 times increase (due to the x3 leverage), but an insane 3 377 000% - good luck for any crypto to beat that!  I couldn't find a single ETP in GraniteShares portfolio of products that achieved the opposite - starting from 1-10$ range and going down to 0.00001$ etc.";"0";"2024-03-03T09:57:06"
"Once a Hot Stock-Market Trend Has a Name, Its Best Days Are Likely too late";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b3zmhb/once_a_hot_stockmarket_trend_has_a_name_its_best/";"Once a Hot Stock-Market Trend Has a Name, Its Best Days Are Likely Past -- Journal Report   March 1, 2024 (Dow Jones)   By Derek Horstmeyer   Once a stock-market trend has been identified and named -- think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven -- the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.   To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Marín Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.   The final list of named trends we researched was:   \-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.   \-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.   \-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.   \-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestlé, L'Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.   \-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.   \-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.   \-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.   \-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce   Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.   From first mention   Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.   For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S&P 500.   The first interesting finding: When we look at the average of all these eight named trends, we see considerable price run-up before the trade being named. For the 24 months before the zero-date, we see the average named trend deliver 36% in excess returns. This means that if you magically knew about a new named trend before it happened, you could earn 36 percentage points above the S&P 500 for the two years before it was named.   Worth the ride, until...   But even if you don't have this magical foresight, it still doesn't hurt to ride a trend once it has been coined. On average, once the trend has been named and looking ahead 12 months, an investor can still earn about 13 percentage points in excess returns.   Yet 12 months following the naming is about the best you can do as returns peak at this point on average and decrease a bit subsequently. From the 12-month mark to the 24-month mark after a trend has been named, the average named trend lags behind the S&P 500 by about 2 percentage points.   When we look at the individual named trends, it might surprise people that the two best trades from the zero-date to the 24-month mark in our sample were the BAT and Cloud trends -- both earning more than 60% in excess return over the two-year period once they were coined by the press.   On the other end, the MT SAAS trade did the worst, dropping more than 95% in excess returns over the two-year period after being named.   All in all, this means your best option is to jump on a named trend as soon as you first hear about it -- provided you haven't been too late to the party -- and ride the initial momentum, if it happens. But if you get in past the 12-month mark, the returns might not be so magnificent.

"2024 According to 5 Major Financial Institutions";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/190f2yq/2024_according_to_5_major_financial_institutions/";"LINKS to outlooks:   * [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/whitepaper/bii-global-outlook-2024.pdf) * [JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/outlook/market-outlook) * [Citi](https://www.privatebank.citibank.com/doc/investments/outlook/Citi_Wealth-Outlook-2024.pdf.coredownload.inline.pdf) * [Mastercard](https://www.mastercardservices.com/en/advisors/economics/insights/economic-outlook-2024) * [Charles Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/2024-global-outlook-big-picture)  I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes.  # Themes  **💡Inflation and interest rates will fall**  The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates.  Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter.  It’s important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year.  **💡CapEx returns**  Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending.  With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back.  More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices.  **💡US election year**  Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election.  Less policy volatility is good for markets.  Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though.  **💡First half angst, second half gains**  Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don’t see a recession happening.  BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a “U-shaped” fashion.  Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end.  **💡Everyone is bullish on AI**  The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC).  In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments:  * Mag 7 (mega cap tech) * Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) * Robotics * Drug discovery * Cybersecurity  **💡International: Japan, China, and India**  For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe.  The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks.  Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance:  >Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets.  # Risks  **💡Economic risks**  Interest rates and inflation are top of mind.  The general worry is that we haven’t felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022’s large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there’s a high chance we’re entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment.  **💡Geopolitical Risks**  Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks.  My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down.  The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now.  Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before.  # Summary  With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of “economic normalization to growth” for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic:  * 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy * 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening * 2024-2025: normalization to growth  We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.";"98";"2024-01-07T01:41:18"
"What allocation approach is implied by Toby Nangle's new FT article on narrow markets driving equity returns?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15lgfgb/what_allocation_approach_is_implied_by_toby/";"What I take from the article below is not to rely too much on a macro-driven asset allocation strategy.  But what asset allocation strategy makes sense in this environment then?    &#x200B:  &#x200B:   www.ft.com /content/c5d7ee71-92a2-4840-9344-2f62e9642e61  # Narrow markets should humble macro forecasters  5-6 minutes   2023-08-08   Toby Nangle    The writer is a former global head of asset allocation at a fund manager   This year has been marked by strong equity markets, and what looks to be an astonishingly narrow rally. Of the 16.9 per cent returned by the S&P 500 index in the first half of this year, 12.9 per cent derived from the performance of only 10 companies.   With such a high proportion of a market’s value created by so few groups, it feels fair to question the tool kits of asset allocators and, more broadly, the product line-up of fund management firms.   Narrow stock market returns are, after all, the norm. Research by Arizona State University professor Hendrik Bessembinder shows that more than half of the $55.1tn in net wealth generated by the US equity market between 1926 and 2022 came from the performance of fewer than 0.3 per cent of the market’s stocks, with the other half of this net wealth coming from the next best 3.1 per cent of stocks.   Moreover, almost three-fifths of stocks actually destroyed wealth over the period. In quant-speak, the distribution of compound stock returns has been very positively skewed.   In addition, the skewness of equity returns turns out not to be a particularly North American phenomenon. Indeed, in the three decades ending in December 2020 the proportion of net wealth contributed by the best 1 per cent of emerging market stocks was more than 80 per cent.   Looking at the entire global stock universe outside the US, the proportion rises still further to more than 90 per cent. Winners have won big. Most individual stocks over the past 30 years have failed to outperform dollars stored under the mattress, let alone a local currency interest-bearing cash deposits — even after taking into account dividends.   Bessembinder’s work has typically been surveyed in terms of what it means for active stockpickers — with some seeing it as a rationalisation for chasing moonshots and others for pursuing passive index-investing. Less examined has been what it means for asset allocators.   Developed market stock index returns have been dominated by global companies — even if they each carry a domestic tilt. As such, connecting local macroeconomic developments to the performance of a region’s equity index can be something of a dark art.   Single large stocks with an economic fate that has little to do with their listing jurisdiction have dominated national index returns. For example, the photolithography machine-maker ASML accounts for more than a fifth of the total net wealth created by Dutch stocks in the 30 years up to 2020. Global fast-fashion retailer Inditex accounts for more than a sixth of Spanish stock returns. Global luxury brands LVMH and L’Oréal collectively account for almost a quarter of the returns from French stocks. These are not outliers. One cannot explain long-term returns without reference to such companies in pretty much any region.   If it becomes hard to explain equity index returns without reference to specific superstar groups, it stands to reason that it must be even harder to forecast equity index returns without taking a view on some individual companies. It’s easy today to focus on whether the Magnificent Seven that have powered the S&P 500 rally — Apple, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta — might stumble. With more than a quarter of the US market’s valuation riding on them, the question is not at all trivial. But 30 years ago, five of these seven had not even listed. It’s hard to take a view on companies that don’t yet exist.   I’ve been as guilty as the next asset allocator in explaining my preference for US over European stocks or vice versa with reference to some domestic macroeconomic outlook. Given that financials, utilities and property groups will carry a strong domestic flavour, this is still forgivable.   But when constructing a long-term strategic asset allocation, it is becoming increasingly untenable to justify regional preferences with reference to local macroeconomic forecasts. This may explain why long-term return forecasts for equity markets — or Capital Market Assumptions, as they are known — have such a lousy record.   The biggest single investment decision any institutional or individual investor is likely to make in their portfolio is their choice of strategic asset allocation. To create a strategic asset allocation one must make reasonable guesses about future market returns. Bessembinder’s research shows quite how invariably such reasonable guesses will be blindsided by the fate of single stocks.";"1";"2023-08-08T14:11:15"
