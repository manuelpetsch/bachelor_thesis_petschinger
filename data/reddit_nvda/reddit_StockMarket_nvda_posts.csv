Do you think this still has a bullish future or has it become grossly overvalued? Even a month back there were stark predictions of price drop, yet here we are.   I’ve definitely found that there are widespread, legit reasons to believe Nvidia will continue to grow in value over the coming months and even years, but one obviously can’t help but hesitate at the price now, even for what it was at the start of September 2023.  Truthfully I sold what I had at that time, thinking that was really gonna be it. But it’s been so exciting to see the climb as it’s been so torturous knowing I could have benefitted.

"NVIDIA ETFs to Watch before Earnings ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1cy01hu/nvidia_etfs_to_watch_before_earnings/";"With NVIDIA reporting earnings today, ETFs with the biggest allocations to the company may be a good play. Here's a quick list:   * Grizzle Growth ETF (DARP),  * Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF (SHOC),  * VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH),  * Invesco PHLX Semicoductor ETF (SOXQ) * TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF (LRNZ)  Here's a link to a Yahoo Finance article about it: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-etfs-buy-ahead-q1-161500070.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-etfs-buy-ahead-q1-161500070.html)  I've been looking these ETFs ex. DARP - NVIDIA is their top position at 19.4% of assets. They also have exposure to the underlying commodities that are in the chips, following the ""Energy Transition"" growth theme we've seen companies move to over the past couple of years.   NVIDIA's earnings today are going to be important to the market, I think a lot of people will decide to buy in and believe the macro cycle for AI will continue if they beat earnings. If not there will probably be a pullback on the tech side but I think NVIDIA will beat, based on their rapid buildout of infrastructure so far. Ex. As data center demand continues to rise, their revenue generation q-o-q will continue to grow.   https://preview.redd.it/w5ld8b6u8z1d1.png?width=931&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcdacebfab87e3c19b0915acc9e7cb8b55da69dd  ";"16";"2024-05-22T15:18:55"
"Nvidia, AMD stocks fall on report of new AI chip bans from Biden administration";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/14kto1m/nvidia_amd_stocks_fall_on_report_of_new_ai_chip/";"Shares of Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. slumped in the extended session Tuesday following a report that the Biden administration is considering a new ban on sales of AI chips to China.  Nvidia shares NVDA,A fell 3% after hours, following a 3.1% gain to close at $418.76, while AMD shares AMD, also fell 3%, after a 2.7% gain in the regular session to close at $110.39.  Late Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported the Commerce Department could further block sales of AI chips to China unless U.S. companies first obtain a special license.  The ban would follow upon similar actions last year that threatened $400 million in Nvidia sales, but the company found a workaround in supplying a version of products that avoided the ban.  Both Nvidia and AMD have launched new AI chips this year: Nvidia in March and AMD earlier in the month. Last year’s release of Open AI’s ChatGPT generative AI — with billions of dollars invested by Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.82% — resulted in an explosion of interest in artificial-intelligence technology, prompting luminaries to herald the technology as the biggest thing in tech since … you name it.";"128";"2023-06-28T01:50:53"
"Nvidia beat earnings, Top expectations";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/13qwyp4/nvidia_beat_earnings_top_expectations/";"Nvidia reported its fiscal first quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom line on the strength of its data center business. The company also said it expects Q2 revenue to come in at about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was expecting $7.2 billion.  Nvidia is at the center of the AI explosion thanks to its high-powered graphics cards and server products, and its stock price is soaring. Over the last year, shares of Nvidia have jumped 77%, while rival AMD has jumped 12%. Intel shares are down 30% in the same timeframe.

"Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA)?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1bbk1cg/technical_analysis_lesson_reversal_day_in_nvidia/";" Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls.  These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do.  Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern.  Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal.  But sometimes the trend changes just in one day...  These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA).  The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’.  It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed.  The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does.  On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close.  But then the tide turned…  Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower.  Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing.   Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day.  That could be the case here.  https://preview.redd.it/du7ft3trfknc1.png?width=1546&format=png&auto=webp&s=30a678b2315583da01802eb3b9451aa073d8471b";"0";"2024-03-10T21:23:08"

I've been using this strategy for the last 5 years and most of my trades were successful, allowing me to make a couple of thousands on the side. It really isn't complicated when you understand the logic behind. Quarterly earnings reports are profitable catalysts.  The most important lesson I've learned is that it's more important to manage your loss than chasing gains. To build wealth in the long run, it's the only thing that really matters. It may sound easy, but emotional decisions driven by greed can empty your portfolio before you know it.

"Nvidia reports earnings, Fed gathers in Jackson Hole: What about this week:";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/15x52j3/nvidia_reports_earnings_fed_gathers_in_jackson/";"In the final week of August, investors will be focused on two major events: Nvidia's earnings and the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole. The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium will kick off on Thursday, with Fed Chair Jay Powell's address serving as the major event. Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week.   August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021.  Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the ""job is done,"" lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%. On the corporate front, all eyes will be on Nvidia, which predicted that artificial intelligence demand will increase its current quarter sales projection from $7 billion to $11 billion. Nvidia stock is up about 200% year to date, but its gains have slowed along with the market since mid-July. Nvidia's earnings release in late May signaled a shift in overall market mood for the year, with Wall Street strategists becoming more overtly bullish on stock market performance in 2023.

"China’s Export Curbs Pose Grave Threat to Nvidia’s $1 Trillion Market Cap, Sending Shockwaves Through the Global Tech Industry";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/14puhvn/chinas_export_curbs_pose_grave_threat_to_nvidias/";"China is the world’s leading producer of gallium and germanium, making any reduction in its output a significant concern for the global tech industry. The limited availability of these metals is likely to slow down production or result in increased prices for manufacturers and their clients in the technology, telecommunications, energy, and automotive sectors. As gallium and germanium are alternatives to traditional silicon wafers in specialized applications, their scarcity could disrupt the supply chain, impacting the production capabilities of companies reliant on these materials.  Gallium and germanium are among dozens of minerals classified by the US government as critical to economic and national security. The US state department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  According to officials and experts in China, Beijing is expected to introduce further retaliatory measures in response to the expansion of US-led controls on technology exports.  “There will be more retaliatory measures against the snowballing semiconductor export controls from western countries,” said one senior official close to the Chinese commerce ministry.  Considering Nvidia is expected to hit 11B+ in revenue for the next quarter, going from 7billion to 11billion considering their already complicated supply chain issues and this is only going to worsen the issue and make it harder for them to meet that expectation.   Nvidia is now “priced for perfection.” The bears can point to pretty much any risk and have a valid point. as a dominant player in the semiconductor industry, Nvidia is far from immune to the potential consequences of China’s export curbs. The company’s market cap of $1 trillion is largely based on its leadership in AI Chips. Nvidia could face significant challenges in maintaining its market dominance and growth trajectory.  The restrictions could impede the company’s access to critical components and hinder its ability to supply AI chips to the Chinese market, which is a major consumer of these technologies. Such restrictions would not only impact Nvidia’s revenue but also create an opportunity for competitors to gain market share in China and beyond.  Kim Yang-paeng, a researcher at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade, said the restrictions were “worrisome” for South Korean chipmakers.  “Korean companies can find alternative sources, but it will take some time . . . if you lack some materials, no matter how important they are, this could hit chip production,” he said.  Based on historical precedents, supply chain disruptions and export curbs have often resulted in market volatility and reduced investor confidence. If Nvidia faces difficulties in sourcing essential materials and encounters restrictions on selling AI chips to China, it could face a decline in market capitalization. The loss of Chinese customers alone, given their significant demand for AI chips, could have a substantial impact on Nvidia’s revenue and market value. Additionally, heightened geopolitical tensions may deter investors and hinder Nvidia’s expansion plans, further eroding its market cap.  China’s export curbs on gallium and germanium, along with the potential limitations on AI chip exports, pose a serious threat to Nvidia’s ability to maintain its $1 trillion market cap. The disruption to the global supply chain, which was just starting to recover. The tech sector in particular, and the uncertainty surrounding future market dynamics could undermine Nvidia’s growth and market dominance.  The recent move by China to impose export restrictions on gallium and germanium, essential metals used in chipmaking and communications equipment, has intensified the geopolitical tensions between China and the United States. These measures, aimed at safeguarding national security and interests, signify a retaliatory response to the semiconductor restrictions imposed by the US. While China’s actions may have short-term implications for Chinese manufacturers, the long-term consequences will undermine Nvidia’s ability to maintain its $1 trillion market cap.

Founded in 1968, Intel’s contributions have been pivotal in the evolution of computing technologies. The company specializes in manufacturing microprocessors, chipsets, embedded processors, and network interface controllers, among others.  ### Intel’s Strategic Pivot Amidst Market Flux  Recent times have been a mix of challenges and opportunities for Intel. The company, once the undisputed leader in semiconductor technology, faces fierce competition from rivals like AMD and NVIDIA, who have made significant inroads into Intel’s market share. The rise of ARM-based processors and the increasing demand for specialized chips for AI and data centers add to the competitive pressure.  Intel’s response to these challenges has been multi-pronged. The company has accelerated its innovation cycle, focusing on next-generation chip technologies. Under the leadership of CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel announced a significant investment in expanding its manufacturing capabilities, aiming to not only meet its own chip demands but also offer foundry services to other chipmakers.  Moreover, Intel is actively diversifying its product portfolio. Its recent advancements in AI, edge computing, and autonomous driving technologies signify a strategic shift.   Leading AI models, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, predominantly utilize Nvidia GPUs hosted in cloud environments. This reliance has contributed to Nvidia’s stock soaring by approximately 230% since the beginning of the year, in stark contrast to Intel’s 68% increase. This trend underlines why competitors like AMD and Intel are now introducing their own chips, aiming to challenge Nvidia’s strong market presence.  Although specifics were sparse, Intel’s Gaudi3 is set to rival Nvidia’s H100, a popular choice for entities constructing extensive chip networks for AI operations, and AMD’s upcoming MI300X. The Gaudi3 is expected to begin distribution to clients in 2024.  However, these strategic decisions come with their own set of risks. The high cost of chip manufacturing and R&D, coupled with the uncertain global economic landscape, poses significant challenges. The company’s ability to execute its ambitious plans while maintaining financial stability is a key factor to watch in the coming years.  ### Recent Financials:  Intel Corporation’s recent financial performance reflects the challenges and resilience of a tech giant in a volatile market. In Q3 2023, the company reported a total revenue of $14.2 billion, a decrease of 8% from the same quarter in the previous year. This decline was primarily due to decreases in revenue across its major segments: the Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue decreased by 3%, the Data Center and AI Group (DCAI) by 10%, and the Network and Edge Group (NEX) by a significant 32%.  The company’s financial strategy also reflects a commitment to operational efficiency and cost management. By streamlining processes and optimizing resources, Intel aims to improve its profitability and shareholder value in the long term. This approach is crucial as the company faces intense competition from other tech giants and emerging players in the semiconductor industry.  In conclusion, Intel’s recent financial performance, though marked by challenges, showcases the company’s strategic efforts to remain a dominant player in the tech industry. The company’s focus on innovation, operational efficiency, and market adaptability will be key to its future success and financial stability.  #### Financial Bullet Points:  * **Revenue (Q3 2023):** $14.2 billion, **down** 8% YoY. * **Client Computing Group Revenue:** **Decreased** by 3%. * **Data Center and AI Group Revenue:** **Decreased** by 10%. * **Network and Edge Group Revenue:** **Decreased** by 32%. * **Gross Margin (Q3 2023):** 42.5%, **slightly down** from 42.6% YoY. * **Net Income (Q3 2023):** $297 million, a **substantial decline** from $1.019 billion YoY. * **Earnings Per Share (Q3 2023):** $0.07, with non-GAAP EPS at $0.41.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/0yxuan2fgg6c1.png?width=1194&format=png&auto=webp&s=528256a735b6b1088b9076cf8053d01466334e11  ### Business Model & Competitors Analysis:  Intel’s business model revolves around its dominance in CPUs, with expansion into data center solutions, IoT, and AI. The company’s shift towards providing foundry services marks a strategic expansion of its business scope.  Competitors like AMD, NVIDIA, and ARM pose significant challenges. AMD’s gains in the CPU market and NVIDIA’s dominance in GPUs and AI chips have encroached on Intel’s turf. ARM’s energy-efficient architecture is increasingly favored for mobile devices and is making inroads into servers, a traditional Intel stronghold.  Intel’s response lies in its comprehensive product range, manufacturing capabilities, and R&D investments. The company’s ability to innovate and adapt to market trends will be crucial in maintaining its competitive edge.  ### SWOT Analysis:  * **Strengths**: Strong brand, diverse product portfolio, manufacturing capabilities. * **Weaknesses**: Margin pressures, high competition, execution risks on strategic shifts. * **Opportunities**: Growth in AI, autonomous tech, and data centers. * **Threats**: Rapid technological changes, competitive market dynamics, global economic uncertainties.  ### Investment Outlook:  Intel’s future performance hinges on its ability to innovate and adapt to market trends. The company’s investment in AI and IoT, along with its strategic focus on foundry services, positions it well for future growth.  After conducting a comprehensive 10-year forecast, our analysis indicates that Intel’s current valuation appears to be justifiable, taking into account a range of scenarios. These scenarios are grounded in conservative (low), moderate (mid), and optimistic (high) financial assumptions, providing a robust framework for evaluating the company’s long-term potential.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/squ40h8ggg6c1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f6f2904b5930e27085da77b8147e50c4b9335c0  #### Concluding Remarks:  In conclusion, Intel Corporation stands at a pivotal point. Its strategic pivots, financial resilience, and commitment to innovation are commendable. Yet, the road ahead is fraught with challenges and competition. Intel’s journey will be a testament to its adaptability and resilience in an ever-evolving tech landscape. For investors, keeping a keen eye on Intel’s execution of its ambitious plans will be crucial in assessing its long-term potential in the dynamic semiconductor industry.";"19";"2023-12-15T13:50:05"

"Ark Invest's Cathie Wood is betting big on AI with these 4 stocks—including one that could skyrocket 750%.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1487t4i/ark_invests_cathie_wood_is_betting_big_on_ai_with/";"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood is known for investing in disruptive innovation. The super investor has placed big bets on artificial intelligence (AI), which is widely regarded as one of the most disruptive and transformative technologies today.  Speaking of AI stocks, it’s hard to ignore what **Nvidia Corp.** ($NVDA) has been doing. Shares of the chipmaking giant have surged 165% so far this year, and the company crossed $1 trillion in valuation at one point.  Ark Invest’s flagship fund **Ark Innovation ETF** ($ARKK) exited its position in Nvidia in January, but some of its other exchange-traded funds (ETFs) still have positions in the chipmaker.  In a recent interview with Bloomberg Television, Wood said that Nvidia “will do well over time.” But she sees a new group of stocks that will “benefit from the foundation that Nvidia has laid.”  The keyword is software.  “In our view, for every dollar of hardware that Nvidia sells, software providers, SaaS \[software as a service\] providers will generate $8 in revenue,” she said. “So we are looking to the software providers who are actually right now where Nvidia was when we first bought it.”  The super investor then named three software companies she believes will thrive because of AI. Here’s a look at the trio and another company she calls “the biggest artificial intelligence play.”  ## UiPath Inc. ($PATH)  UiPath is a robotic process automation software company that provides automation solutions for businesses. Its AI-powered UiPath Business Automation Platform is capable of understanding, automating and operating end-to-end processes.  In the first quarter of 2023, the company’s revenue grew 18% year over year to $289.6 million. Notably, its dollar-based net retention rate was 122%.  The stock has surged 47% year to date, but it hasn’t always been a hot commodity: In 2022, UiPath shares plunged 70%.  Wood’s Ark Innovation ETF owns 28,865,375 shares of UiPath. With the position valued at $517.28 million, UiPath is the fourth-largest holding at Ark.  ## Twilio Inc. ($TWLO)  Twilio’s cloud communications platform allows businesses to develop and integrate various communication channels into their applications. Its application programming interfaces enable developers to incorporate voice, messaging and video seamlessly, helping companies enhance customer engagement.  In the first quarter, Twilio surpassed 300,000 active customer accounts. Meanwhile, revenue rose 15% year over year to $1.01 billion.  In its latest earnings conference call, Twilio Co-Founder and CEO Jeff Lawson said he believes that artificial intelligence “will be a material accelerant over time for Twilio’s business.”  Ark Innovation ETF holds 4,680,705 shares of Twilio, a stake with a market value of $303.54 million.  ## Teladoc Health Inc. ($TDOC)  Wood’s flagship fund also owns $301.07 million worth of telemedicine company Teladoc Health.  The company’s platform connects patients with healthcare professionals through video, phone and messaging.  At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, when in-person nonemergency medical care was temporarily halted, the demand for telehealth services skyrocketed.  In 2020, Teladoc attracted a lot of investor attention as its revenue shot up 98%.  While the pandemic is largely in the rearview mirror, the company continues to expand its business. Teladoc’s first-quarter revenue showed an 11% increase year over year.  The stock, however, wasn’t able to maintain the upward momentum. Trading at $24.30 per share, Teladoc is down more than 90% from its all-time high reached in February 2021.

"Investment plan for about 85 000$ USD over the coming year";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1521zl5/investment_plan_for_about_85_000_usd_over_the/";"So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years.  I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030.  However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now.  I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices.  The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (**European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ** \- I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of **Norwegian dividend stocks** (Done)-Buy shares in **AMD** for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in **Alphabet** ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin **Tesla Corp** TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in **TSMC** TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to **bank account** I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time)  Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco **S&P 500 UCITS ETF** Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE **China UCITS ETF** FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE **India UCITS ETF** FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering **Apple** APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering **Microsoft** MSF, **Meta** FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering **Amazon** (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-**Berkshire Hathaway Class B** BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering **Palantir** PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered **Nvidia** (FOMO)-Considered **IBM** and **Intel** as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)  So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?  Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)";"0";"2023-07-17T15:28:09"

"If AI is the next big thing, is Palantir the thing?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/17o72gm/if_ai_is_the_next_big_thing_is_palantir_the_thing/";" Hello,  Recent [report](https://www.palantir.com/2023-ai-ds-ml-market-study/download/) from Dresden have ranked Palantir as the No. 1 Vendor in AI, marking its emergence as a significant player in the industry.  In addition, Palantir is now [eligible](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/palantir-stock-forecast-pltr-price-surges-21-after-q3-earnings-beat-on-top-and-bottom-202311021434) for inclusion in the S&P 500, signifying its growing importance in the financial market.  The company's [third-quarter earnings](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-movers-0fab2fba) report indicates a notable shift towards the commercial market, reducing its reliance on government contracts (55% actually). Furthermore, Palantir has achieved profitability for the fourth consecutive quarter. It's worth noting that the company is debt-free and holds $3.3 billion in cash and short-term equivalents.  From a technical perspective, it's important to be cautious as there isn't a clear long-term support level for the stock. Currently, the stock is trading at over 15 times its projected 2023 revenue, with earnings expected to grow at a rate exceeding 80% per year (PE ratio reduction can be due to earning increase or value reduction).  However, Palantir still needs to focus on increasing its profit margin, which stood at 1%, 2%, and 7% in the last three quarters, respectively.  Is Palantir destined to become the next major tech company, or is it simply generating hype without substantial substance?  Thank you";"69";"2023-11-05T08:52:58"
"Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/19esa5z/why_am_i_bullish_on_sfy_instead_of_spy/";"A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings:  https://preview.redd.it/evtbd2dnkgec1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=47c5c6d9f58e6997aad5330dba32ff543e2c8541  Data Sources:  * SPY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/spy/holdings/)​​, [Schwab](https://www.schwab.wallst.com/schwab/Prospect/research/etfs/schwabETF/index.asp?type=holdings&symbol=SPY)​​, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/?guccounter=1)​​. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST)​ * SFY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/sfy/holdings/)​​, [Zacks.com](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/SFY/holding)​​, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SFY/holdings/)​​. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST)  **Key Observations:**  * Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. * Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. * Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting.  It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation.  I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors:  1. **Expense Ratio**: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. 2. **Stock Selection Methodology**: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. 3. **Performance Trends**: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. 4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. 5. **Market Positioning**: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. 6. **Innovative Approach of SoFi**: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.  It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.  **What are your thoughts?**";"0";"2024-01-24T22:46:21"
"ATH | Leverage | Index Funds and more";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/17p3k55/ath_leverage_index_funds_and_more/";"I got a few questions as a newbie  &#x200B:  1. Some of the companies I want to invest long-term are either at their ATH or close to ATH, like Microsoft  or Nvidia. I'm wondering whether I should wait for it to drop, because most of the stock market is green this year, so I have a feeling it may drop since it grew so much, what do you think? Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy 2. Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? 3. Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow?  4. Stock Math  - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back? Logically the first answer, but something doesn't give me a peace of mind here, so I prefer to ask 5. Eli Lilly - what do you think about this stock? Growed massive amount lately, and pharmaceutical industry will definitely be there in 5 or 10 years.";"0";"2023-11-06T15:10:12"
"Which Stock: Intel or AMD?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/18sy7p1/which_stock_intel_or_amd/";"Hi there! I’m a new investor in their early 20s trying to set myself up for financial freedom and wealth in the future. I’m more of a passive investor, not trying to time the market, more so trying to buy good stocks that I can feel good about holding onto in the next 5 or 10 years.  As much as I can try to research on my own with news, analyzing graphs (although I did not study finance and self-educating takes a while), and listening to others, I wanted to start a discussion to hear about this community’s thoughts on both stocks. They’re both in the same market striving for similar things, and both of them are trying to catch up to NVIDIA (which has taken off to the point where that stock is more or less inaccessible to someone like me).  I bought into both Intel and AMD among my other holdings, but I want to sell one and put all of my money into the other. Which one has better potential do you think? Obviously Intel is cheaper, but will it have as much upside as AMD? Let me know your thoughts.";"9";"2023-12-28T17:40:35"

I think NVIDIA currently serves as a de facto investment vehicle for those bullish on AI, an effective proxy for AI growth, acting in essence as an AI ETF.   Which brings the question, why are new AI companies so shy on going public? In contrast with other ""bubbles"" (e.g dot-com) we are not seeing a lot of action.

However, with this exciting opportunity comes the challenge of deciding where to allocate my funds and which investment strategy to pursue. Currently, l've evenly split my investments between an investment account and a high-yield savings account, both of which have grown to close to $20k. However, I can't help but feel that I might be missing out on potential returns by keeping too much in the high yield savings account and lacking a clear investment strategy for stocks. When I first started investing at 18, I focused on stocks that seemed promising and affordable. However, i've come to realize that this may not be the most effective strategy. Now that I'm taking investing Investing more seriously, I'm eager to explore new strategies. Recently, l've been experimenting with purchasing VOO, but aside from that, I'm feeling a bit lost on where to go next.

"What could actually destabilize the stock market right now?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1aoqfgz/what_could_actually_destabilize_the_stock_market/";"I'll start. I want to read others opinions and ideas.      The general consensus right now is we're going through great weather in the stock market, smooth sailing. Maybe even a lot of confidence to be surfing the big waves. There are some things I see on the horizon.     1. The AI transition, although has the potential to do great things, is not being adopted so fast and in the pertient areas for actual economic growth. Because of this, AI as a tool for economic growth will plateu for a couple of years. Even though it's great, it has serious limitations right now and can't help whomever do something beyond their own capabilities to a degree that makes them as competent as an expert human being. Coding wise I can tell that much is certain. So I anticipate a disilusion coming from the AI expectations that are out there soon to bring the market down. Specially Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, etc. 2. There is a serious disconnect between low income and high income people. Low income being the vast majority. This is causing insecurity to rise and creep into areas where that wasn't a problem before. As a consequence... low income people will save instead of spend, and high income people will keep spending, creating an unrealistic measurement of how the economy is doing. This will keep inflation and the prices of goods from coming down, preventing economic growth to come from both low, medium and high income populations. Making the FED reconsider lowering rates as inflation numbers are updated. 3. Slowly but surely companies will let go of staff and the unemployment number will go up. Adding weight to the idea that raising rates is a no go for now. High unemployment levels can lead to decreased consumer spending, further slowing economic growth and complicating efforts to combat inflation. 4. Group monopolization: Tech companies and a relatively small group of companies are taking most of the pie. This imbalance will have an effect on the quality of goods being produced. Only a handful of options will be left to choose from and the will of entreprenours will be eroded from not being able to compete with companies who can keep financing the production of their products regardless of their bad quality. So a general lack of doing business motivation will permeate the air and consumers could attempt to simply stop purchasing and going the DIY route. 5. Europe in general seems to be in a hole. Swiss banks will have some turbulence in the near, medium term future: the debt of countries like Greece, Italy, Spain, etc will just start adding up and making the Euro currency to continue to lose value against other currencies. 6. Geopolitical tensions could escalate in different fronts and cause bottlenecks in production, transportation, travel, etc. You have the US-China relationship disputing technology and intellectual property rights and creating a competition with other countries for where goods are produced to be imported to the US. Escalation in tensions could bring about tariffs, sanctions, or retaliatory measures. There's also the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel-Gaza situation, Iran and Western countries over nuclear programs, other oil producing nations and the oil pricing situation. 7. US elections coming soon.     Considering this and the list below of what has triggered the US stock market to go down at least 20%, what do you see creeping up, potentially, as a catalyst for the market to flip to bear territory?     1. **1973-1974 Stock Market Crash**: Triggered by the oil crisis following the Yom Kippur War, when OAPEC (Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries) proclaimed an oil embargo. This, coupled with high inflation, stagnating economic growth (stagflation), and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, led to a severe bear market. 2. **Early 1980s Recession**: High inflation rates, exacerbated by oil price shocks and aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker to combat inflation, led to a severe recession and a significant market downturn in the early 1980s. 3. **Black Monday, 1987**: On October 19, 1987, stock markets around the world crashed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropping by 22% in a single day. Factors included trade deficits, rising interest rates, and overvaluation, but the crash was exacerbated by the widespread use of portfolio insurance and automated trading systems. 4. **Dot-com Bubble Burst, 2000-2002**: After years of speculative investment in internet-based companies, the bubble burst in 2000, leading to a significant market correction. Many tech companies saw their stock values plummet, leading to a broader market downturn and a mild recession. 5. **Global Financial Crisis, 2007-2009**: Triggered by the collapse of the housing bubble in the United States, leading to a crisis in subprime mortgages and a severe liquidity crunch. This crisis quickly spread globally, leading to significant declines in stock markets worldwide, bank failures, and a deep global recession. 6. **COVID-19 Pandemic, 2020**: The global outbreak of COVID-19 led to unprecedented economic disruption, as governments around the world imposed lockdowns and travel restrictions to combat the pandemic. The uncertainty and sudden stop in economic activity led to a sharp, but relatively short-lived, market downturn in March 2020.";"230";"2024-02-12T04:31:16"

This early stage innovation will trickle down  into public markets sooner that expected.

I respect it could challenge the ATH and get pretty aggressive, so I chose a credit spread as opposed to opening any kind of debit with a Stop Loss.

"Worse case scenario: the perfect Bear cocktail";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1aq1g2o/worse_case_scenario_the_perfect_bear_cocktail/";"After reading all the comments from my last post and doing some more thinking. I decided to entertain the idea of what would be the perfect Bear cocktail that could trigger a Stock Market destabilization. I'm not taking into account any type of positive news. I'm simply going the negative route, in a slow and systematic manner, without any huge trigger events.  What am I missing and at what dates that's important and could also add to this?  If you notice in the prior post list, three out of six times... rising interest rates were part of the cause that brought the market down at least 20%. Oil price shocks two out of 6. Then there´s speculative investments at the dotcom bubble. Covid, overvaluation, trade tensions... Stagflation. So these have to be in the mix one way or another:     Cocktail Potential Ingredients:   1. Rising interest rates.   2. Oil price shocks.   3. Speculative tech investments.   4. Overvaluation.   5. Trade tensions.   6. Stagflation.   7. New round of Covid-19.   8. Housing or Commercial Real Estate Bubble.     So this is the speculative worse case scenario we could have without going as far as having a WWIII:     February 13, 2024: CPI report comes in hot. S&P500 comes down 1.5%, some buy the tiny dip.   February 15, 2024: Jobless claims rise. Doesn't alter the market but adds to the cocktail mix.  February 16, 2024: A higher-than-expected PPI indicates increasing costs at the producer level, which can signal rising inflationary pressures. Producers might pass these higher costs onto consumers, leading to an increase in consumer prices and overall inflation. The Fed to consider tightening monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to combat inflation. This could include raising interest rates or adjusting the pace of tapering asset purchases.  Financial markets don't react negatively to a higher-than-expected PPI, as it they priced it in from the CPI report.   February 21, 2024: Nvidia posts earnings, they actually do fine but investors realize that´s gonna be the ceiling for now so the stock falls 15%. Other tech stocks get stained by the fear, bringing the S&P500 2.5% lower. AI investment sentiments leans towards potentially speculative for now.  March 12, 2024: February´s CPI report comes in hot again, causing Algorithmic trades to sell and bring down the S&P500 another 2%.  March 19-20, 2024: FOMC Meeting gives subtext of potentially not bringing interest rates down yet. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterates emphasis on the central bank's commitment to combating inflation, even if it requires keeping interest rates high for an extended period. This brings down the market sentiment down and numbers another 1%.   April 5, 2024:  In a CNBC YouTube video report, experts delve into the complexities of the current commercial real estate (CRE) market. The rise of remote work led to a decreased demand for office spaces, the pandemic trained people to make purchases online, commercial real estate bubble starts to show symptoms of cracking up.   April 10, 2024: CPI report is on ambiguous. Not up, not down. Anything could happen at this point. Aprils report will define what the FED will do and the next 6 months of stock market activity. Market loses .5%  April 17, 2024: Tom Lee's bullish perspective has been challenged by the prior events and during an interview he mentions that this was the turmoil he had been expecting but sees the S&P500 going back to 5,200 points by the end of the year. Currently at 4,600... 7.5% below all time highs.  May 1, 2024: FOMC Meeting leaves a bad taste in mouth. Jerome shifts narrative towards not lowering interests rates yet. Market falls another 2.5% on the bad sentiment.  May 15, 2024:  Situations in the Middle East, such as tensions in Gaza or Iran, could impact global oil supplies by affecting regional stability and energy infrastructure. Saudi Arabia, a key OPEC member, might alter its oil production strategy in response to shifts in global politics, economic pressures, or changes in energy demand. Actions perceived as irrational could stem from strategic decisions to protect national interests, influence oil prices, or respond to international events. S&P500 falls 0.5%.  July 8, 2024: A new wave of Covid-19 actually breaks through the collective deceit of it being over because death rates rise significantly and word spreads out again from hospital staff that's it's getting real bad. Stock market reacts in a mixed manner. Amazon and tech companies go up a little, small caps enter another bad rout. S&P500 falls 1%.  July 20, 2024: Numbers start to confirm a Stagflation situation actually taking place. A significant slowdown in economic growth, rising unemployment rates, declining consumer spending, and a contraction in manufacturing. Inflation pressures, coupled with tightening monetary policies aimed at controlling price levels, contribute to decreased economic activity. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions serve as catalysts, further straining global markets. The interconnectedness of these factors in precipitate a recessionary environment. S&P500 falls .7%.  July 23, 2024: Nvidia reports and disappoints, falls another 8% in tandem with other tech companies.  July 25, 2024: Commercial Real Estate bubble pops and hits the news hard. S&P500 falls 1.4% At 13.6% the all time highs from January 2024. Currently at 4,400 points.  August 14, 2024: After all the earnings reports it becomes increasingly clear: the FED won't lower rates and will keep them there for longer than expected: consumer spending is declining, companies keep firing people, the Bear narrative takes over. The S&P500 falls to 4,010 points. 23.5% below all time highs. It stays around here for the next 6 months, falls further and gets better by the end of 2025.   ";"10";"2024-02-13T20:00:48"

In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions.  &#x200B:  It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post.  &#x200B:  The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%.  &#x200B:  The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%.  &#x200B:  Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%.  &#x200B:  Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said.  &#x200B:  That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote.  &#x200B:  Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found.  &#x200B:  Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July.  &#x200B:  The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said.  &#x200B:  The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering.  &#x200B:  SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown.  &#x200B:  Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78%  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%,  [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. AMZN, 0.16%,  Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%,  Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%,  Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%,  and Meta Platforms Inc.  META, 0.56%.  &#x200B:  See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024?  &#x200B:  Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind.  &#x200B:  The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.  &#x200B:  In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high:  &#x200B:  The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted.  &#x200B:  Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.";"9";"2023-12-27T16:52:27"

Meanwhile, the UK PPI printed at -1.5% MoM – a material downside surprise compared to expectations.   https://preview.redd.it/t1r9333pxf7b1.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=43ce5d03fe45bf3f09461a0f9ec581a2483d842a";"1";"2023-06-21T23:40:48"
"The Rise of Data Centers: An Alternative to NVDA’s Dominance in the AI Market.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1525xgb/the_rise_of_data_centers_an_alternative_to_nvdas/";"Wall Street Awakens to New Opportunities Amidst Overvaluation Concerns and NVDA’s Vulnerabilities  In recent times, the technology landscape has been dominated by the impressive growth and innovation of companies like Nvidia (NVDA), which have become synonymous with artificial intelligence (AI) advancements. However, a new contender has emerged, challenging the notion that NVDA is the sole option for investors seeking exposure to the AI market. Data centers, once considered a supporting player, are now positioning themselves as formidable alternatives with the potential to not only rival but surpass the computing power of NVDA. This article explores the rise of data centers and the vulnerabilities of NVDA, shedding light on the implications they pose for investors amidst concerns of NVDA’s overvaluation on Wall Street.  The Alternative Powerhouses: Data centers have traditionally served as the backbone of cloud computing, storing vast amounts of information and providing processing capabilities to various industries. However, with the exponential growth of AI applications, data centers have evolved into powerhouses capable of supporting complex computational tasks and training neural networks. Unlike NVDA, which primarily focuses on semiconductors, data centers possess the infrastructure, scalability, and dedicated resources required to handle the intensive computing demands of AI algorithms. They are now ready to challenge NVDA’s dominance in terms of computing power and offer a more diverse investment opportunity in the semiconductor market.  Overvaluation Concerns and Market Perception: The buzz surrounding NVDA’s achievements has led to concerns of overvaluation as investors rush to invest in what was once considered the primary AI play. The stock’s valuation has skyrocketed, raising questions about its sustainability. However, market perceptions are shifting, driven by the emergence of data centers as a compelling alternative. Savvy investors are recognizing the potential benefits of diversifying their portfolios and exploring opportunities beyond NVDA, which could protect them from the risks associated with an overvalued stock.  The Shift in Market Dynamics: The financial landscape is dynamic and ever-evolving, with market sentiment and trends constantly shifting. The growing recognition of data centers as a powerful alternative to NVDA signals a potential turning point in the AI market. As the market becomes saturated with NVDA investments, the demand for alternative investment opportunities is expected to surge.  Blackstone’s Strategic Focus: Notably, Blackstone, a prominent player in the investment landscape, has already made a decisive move in favor of data centers. Recognizing the changing and highly competitive nature of the semiconductor sector, Blackstone has chosen to prioritize investments in data centers. This strategic shift underscores their confidence and foresight, as they find valuations more favorable and growth more prominent in the data center market.  Investing in Data Centers: A Viable Strategy? Given the increasing competitiveness of data centers, investors seeking exposure to the AI market may find it wise to explore this emerging sector. Data centers provide a robust and diversified approach, offering access to a range of companies harnessing AI capabilities. By investing in data centers, individuals can capitalize on the growing demand for AI-driven computing power while mitigating the risks associated with NVDA’s vulnerabilities and potential overvaluation.  Conclusion: The dominance of NVDA in the AI market is no longer assured, as data centers rise to prominence and challenge its position. While NVDA has undoubtedly been at the forefront of AI advancements, the emergence of data centers as a formidable alternative cannot be ignored. Investors are increasingly recognizing the value of diversifying their portfolios and exploring alternative opportunities beyond NVDA’s potential overvaluation. Wall Street is awakening to the vulnerabilities of NVDA and the immense potential of data centers, which are poised to reshape the investment landscape and provide a broader array of opportunities in the AI market. Blackstone’s strategic focus on data centers further solidifies their importance in the shifting technological landscape.";"3";"2023-07-17T17:59:44"
"Best way to minimise our losses as a retail trader …";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/152vhl5/best_way_to_minimise_our_losses_as_a_retail_trader/";"In this post i will try point out some of my experiences from the years of trading in the equity market, how we all retail traders can minimize our losses via just implementing 4 different ideas in your trading style so we can have the edge over others and how we can intellectually find some good trades.// please feel free to add your ideas , strategies how you trade, your principles of trading and give me suggestion in the comments if I wrote something wrong   1.ATTITUDE- First of all ,what's trading its prediction right ,in every trade don’t try to be expert don’t try to predict every hour , every day, every week in the market its nearly impossible to catch the obvious moves, because generally everybody knows it and it is already priced in the asset price. You should know what to stake and when to take a loss. Always think markets are supreme and never say I was right and market is wrong otherwise you will never learn. My golden rule in trading is ""following the momentum"" price is the first indicator which will tell you ,you are wrong instantly exit from your position with the small loss. Always remember this quote ""you have to loose many battles to win a war"" don't be emotionally connected to a trade    2. TECHNIQUE-You should know know your trading technique, way better than anyone else lets take the common example of option strategy if you think your bullish,exactly how much bullish you are and what strategy suits you either it is debit call spread to cut your cost for entry but never feel greedy or fearful about any trade because you have to leave your emotions at home when you are competing with the heavy hedge funds and high net worth traders which want to suck your money out of your veins and wanna try to bankrupt you ,it seems so obvious but i have seem shit tone of post people screaming about what to do next because they don't know about volatility crush,they didn't had any exit plan and they don't know what to do when your strategy backfire at you try to have a plan for example if you are playing earnings what I will do if volatility drops what i will do if the volatility increases because people don't know market don't price in 2 times on the same news. They usually see gains and they will feel euphoria because they are right and they usually don't close the position for the gains because now they are expecting more from the market which ultimately make them to loose ton of money (always trade with a stop loss)   3.UNDERSTANDING THE MARKET-the most important aspect of trading is to know what is the state of market or economy which will provide you a broad direction which is the backbone of any strategy you will imply. It is important to have a knowledge of the clear trend of the market, always keep on the eye on the upcoming events in the economy which can effect the markets major events like GDP releases , have a close look on fed decisions and it is gonna effect the markets you should be ahead of the most of the public because most of the people are too lazy to see the charts,data on time and there whole focus is to buy and selling securities without having the idea of the broad direction of the market. Always compare it with how other country's economy has affected them then you can get the idea. Other indicators such as Non-farm payrolls, inflation, dollar strength or weakness because it is gonna affect the exporting and importing companies sooner or later, the price of the crude oil can think how this gonna affect my trading companies for example cut of production in the OPEC results in the profit of the companies like ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, Pioneer Energy if you had an edge you could have reap the profit from this news.   4.FUNDAMENTALS-For me, its important to see the technical analysis of the stock price to see the future price is fine ,but having a strong grip on the fundamentals of the company always gives you an edge over the other traders who are just following the momentum for the profit or who are just buying calls or puts because they heard on CNBC that it has a huge upside and it will have a crazy earnings next quarter. If you had read the balance sheet ,income statement and cash flow right by seeing all the factors such as EPS, debt and hell lot of others. You can identify the patterns which other people cannot look upon because sometimes the business model is right company is profitable everything going good but share price is really down which will give you a advantage to make a trading decision.   But also lemme clear you one thing which is ""The shares are gonna come to its mean value which is for sure but when nobody knows many had tried to short the NVIDIA and TSLA and went bankrupt because they thought its too expensive but they forgot the rule no 1 about don't go against the momentum it will kill you ,if you are not sure about the trend do go against , yes you can make a lot of money to predict a trend reversal as many of you have seen 'The big short movie"" and want to become like burry so friend don't go against or at least wait until the trend turns because no one can predict the market too perfectly and it the trend is against you just square off your positions because you have already lost that trade   so guys i have gave enough meat here, I know i can be wrong so please give me your suggestion in your comment section and what to think about it  thanks.";"2";"2023-07-18T13:10:49"
