"When NVIDIA pops the entire market will get wrecked";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cx85p5/when_nvidia_pops_the_entire_market_will_get/";"Why is everyone so bullish on NVIDIA? They would need to be the biggest company in the world for their stock to hit these astronomical predictions. 99% of the value is based on hype and bullshit reminiscent of the days when the Cyber Truck was announced.   How many of these GPUs have they actually delivered? How many gpus do these big tech companies actually need? What makes NVIDIAs GPU immune to being copied by competitiors?   AFAIK their bread and butter is the software/drivers allowing the chip to do it's magic and there are rumors of people working on allowing it to run on other GPUs. It's only a matter of time before a competitor releases something for a fraction of the price.   Maybe I'm wrong but I can see the hype dying down when these Blackwell GPUs actually get delivered and the orders stop, anyone that actually works in a data center can attest they don't upgrade their servers every 6 months, they don't need to buy new hardware every year either.    If and when it does go down the entire market will be a blood bath, the magnificent 7 stocks are practically a meme at this point and the only thing holding the S&P together.";"2530";"2024-05-21T15:39:35"

"NVIDIA is now oversold ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ba22rc/nvidia_is_now_oversold/";"I'm an old school investor. I enjoy charts and dividends and reasonable sustainable growth over time. Today was a rough day for NVDA stock, but in the grand scheme of things, it was really just a Tuesday.   The reality is, NVDA was up 7% this week, Monday-Friday. It's massive run up to $974, while exciting, was not healthy or sustainable and a pull back from the intraday open of 5% was a good thing.   If you're measuring NVDA from it's daily high if 974 to it's close of $875: well, don't. It closed at $926 Thursday and was really just down 5% from that. The AH/Pre market etc on low volume artificially blew that open price up making today look much worse than it was....  So where does it go from here?  Here's the reality:  - AI is the future, we are at the starting line. There's are few precedents for this, so everyone saying it's over bought are missing a key element. The limit is unknown. NVDA very well could be the most valuable company on the planet. 4T market cap is not unreasonable, on continued growth as shown over the last several ERs. We've really just started to scratch the surface.  - NVDA competition is non -existent. They have at least 2 years of runway before anyone can even reasonably expect to be even close to in a position to compete. Even then, NVDA will have advanced and have the advantage.   - Everyone needs AI chips. They need them because customers are demanding AI, and thus more h100s need to be bought. The demand for AI hasnt slowed. It remains and is accelerating daily. NVDA will continue to make record profits for the foreseeable future as the only real game in time to provide the chips requires to build this new industry.  - Today's sell-off was orchestrated by the big boys (look at how quickly and how well timed it was,) but the big boys will be back in next week, taking advantage of the now cheaper stocks and using the 600% gains from the puts they bought before triggering the sell off to get back on the ride.   -NVDA is an easy candidate for a split. Whether it happens at $1000 or $850 is irrelevant. But it's coming, and retail will cheer it.  Tldr  BERS are fukt, NVDA gonna more sustainably climb next week another 7% ish next week to ~$922-$930. It will continue this way until $1000 likely between 3/22 and 3/27.  Stop worrying about AH and pre market movements on low volume. Start looking at the longer term growth..";"2632";"2024-03-08T23:59:58"

It has about 50 buildings world wide and outsourced it manufacturing. TSMC and the Chinese produce the physical chips.  Thing is, if something was to happen to a manufacturing plant, natural or terroristic because the supply chain and how little redundant manufacturing they have. Any hiccup would cause a catastrophic downward spiral. They don't need more cash and that's what an insurance payout would give.  They need a rock solid supply chain.  The real problem is to many institutions, 401k, and life savings are heavily propped up by nvidia. This makes it a national security threat.  A sell off of this magnitude or even correction is going to devastate our economy.  I personally believe they need to rethink and move their manufacturing to the USA. Their margins are high enough to cover the labor cost, and it is in the instrest of the USA for them to do so.   I personally sold my nvida positions and calling it a day.

Given that self driving cars are a really hot thing right now in the AI space, I think that there's a good chance that Huang will talk about it much more tomorrow and potentially have an impressive showing of progress. If he does, Tesla should go down, potentially erasing all of todays gains on the questionably bullish news. Regardless of how good Nvidia's earnings are, their presentation will likely be bad for Tesla since they will be talking about competing with Tesla. I think that in all cases, Tesla goes down after the Nvidia earnings presentation. The worst (best for puts) case scenario would be bad Nvidia earnings coupled with Huang doubling down on competing with Tesla on self driving and robots.   TLDR: The hottest part of the AI space right now is self driving and robotics. Jensen Huang loves to make grand presentations and will likely talk about Nvidia's ambitions and progress in both of these areas tomorrow.

"DD: I DD'd the nvidia run up last year ($250->$700) and was right. Now I have a new prediction";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1biqt1k/dd_i_ddd_the_nvidia_run_up_last_year_250700_and/";"Here's my nvidia DD from last year (NVDA was $250 and I predicted $700 within a year): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd\_nvda\_to\_700\_by\_this\_time\_next\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd_nvda_to_700_by_this_time_next_year/)  Last week I timed the exit on my BTC and QQQ holdings fairly well. **Now I'm setting my sights on a new horizon: AMD**  AMD is sort of like the nice ugly step sister of hot bae nvidia. Everyone ""likes"" her, but she doesn't get invited to parties and no one takes her seriously. Right now reminds me of Ryzen 1. When AMD was $12, I predicted AMD's stock price would triple in the next two years due to how well the architecture fit with datacenter needs. I posted my DD here and was right. It took most people by surprise because at the time Intel had 99% of the datacenter CPU market. Now we look at $180+ AMD price. I think we are once again going to be surprised by su bae and co.  I'll get to my evidence that AMD will exceed expectations yet again, but first I want to address some obvious points of skepticism.  1. **Firstly AMD's seemingly absurd P/E ratio of 364:** I'm going to show that not only is AMD's revenue going to go up by an absurd amount in the next year, but also its net income margin. Nvidia operates at around 50% income right now and AMD is operating at around 20% right now. That gap is going to close considerably in the next year. I'm estimating AMD will reach around 35-40% net income. On top of that AMD will grow revenue by 50% in the next year (wishful thinking would say as high as 70% more revenue) exclusively due to AI accelerators. This will all lead to considerably more realistic P/E ratio. 2. **Next Nvidia's control on the market:** The evidence points to this being a detriment to Nvidia. AI companies are looking to diversify from Nvidia because they don't want to be vendor-locked, Nvidia has a 1 year back order on its top AI accelerators, and Nvidia's massive profit margin makes it easy to undercut their price. Furthermore, CUDA dominance is highly exaggerated today. I use this stuff every day, and ROCm is absolutely production ready, especially for large companies who have the staff to optimize for it. The people who say ROCm sucks haven't used it in a while -- AMD is working on it at a break neck pace.  # Now on to my DD  The debate about AMD's price largely boils down to its newest AI accelerator's value (the MI300X) versus Nvidia's current AI accelerator (the H100). AI accelerators are now most of the accelerator market (including GPUs), and also have the highest profit margins by far, so they are basically 80% of the valuation on these companies' stock prices. Yes the H200 and the new GB200 are coming out soon for Nvidia, but the MI300X has a timing lead on them which enables it to get some foothold. So for the moment, its MI300X vs H100 for companies deciding what to buy.  **Accelerator Value:** Reviews for the MI300X are going to come out imminently (within a few weeks), and we will begin seeing hard evidence for its value proposition then. I have spent a lot of time on older AMD cards analyzing their performance versus big green. My findings are that generally AMD is capable of being as fast or faster than Nvidia, but most open source projects are optimized better for Nvidia so in the real world AMD has a performance disadvantage. However in the case of the MI300X, its raw performance is so large over an H100, it will likely produce slightly better real world performance. Also the MI300X is selling for around $25k per card (you can buy it right now [https://www.thinkmate.com/system/a+-server-8125gs-tnmr2](https://www.thinkmate.com/system/a+-server-8125gs-tnmr2)) where the H100 is around $40k, so companies will be looking at benchmarks in a couple weeks that point to the MI300X being slightly faster and considerably less expensive.  **Nvidia supply constraint:** Nvidia has a back order of around a year for their latest AI accelerators. This means if a company needs to immediately purchase accelerators for a new project, they simply can't from Nvidia at scale. AMD's order books are currently open, but probably filling fast for this reason.  **Announced customers:** Meta is going to be the largest customer for the MI300X. They have indirectly announced that they will purchase up to almost half of their 600k accelerators this year from AMD ([https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/meta\_ai\_chips/](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/meta_ai_chips/)). This customer alone will add 25% to AMD's revenue and improve their profit margin from 20% to roughly 28%. MS has already started deploying the MI300X on Azure and Oracle has announced they will launch VMs with them, but neither has announced numbers. Who won't be using AMD? OpenAI has a multi-year contract with nvidia, and Google uses their own proprietary TPU.  **AI accelerator headwind:** The AI accelerator market is expected to have a CAGR of over 20% for the next 5+ years. This means there will be continued supply constraints that incentivize diversifying hardware. New players inherently have an advantage because of this. It just happens that AMD is the next new player to be mature and scaled enough for widespread adoption. Yes Intel and startups will probably do fine also, but AMD is seeing ridiculous growth at this very moment that hasn't appeared on their earnings report yet (fulfillment for the MI300X did not ramp up until roughly January). There is such a ridiculous amount of demand in this ai accelerator market that everyone in it will grow.  # My price target: $450 AMD  After doing some napkin math on the market, I think it is reasonable for AMD to acquire 15-20% of the AI accelerator market by the end of the year, up from an inconsequential market share before. This includes speculation about AMD's product competitiveness, their ability to scale, the customers that will be interested in buying AMD, market growth, and new Nvidia product launches. Extrapolating that marketshare into net income by using a rough margin per card and using Nvidia's P/E ratio as a baseline model, translates to an AMD fair stock price of around $450 by the end of the year.  AMD's price will start to go up after the MI300X reviews come out and rumors of their customer acquisitions come in. The May earnings report will be where it starts to appear on their books, but they are still ramping up right now and Q2 is where we will see the largest earnings growth.  **My positions are: $190 6/21C and $200 10/18C**  That's all. See you later this year.";"3655";"2024-03-19T19:04:40"

"Nvidia has peaked, time for Warner Bros";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1b37byx/nvidia_has_peaked_time_for_warner_bros/";"üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ  Let‚Äôs analyze the S&P 500‚Äôs best performer, and their worst.   I truly think NVDA is as great of a company as they say. That‚Äôs why I invested at $150 a share when they were down off crypto (couldn‚Äôt hold it as it went down to $120 and I was full ported $6k in shares on margin, I do belong here I‚Äôm not the best at dip buying). I just think the other semiconductor companies like TSM haven‚Äôt yet enjoyed the catch up growth, and we‚Äôll soon find that NVIDIA‚Äôs moat is not as big they say it is.  In any case, WBD is now down ~90% due to the combo of the possible death of cable, theaters, the strikes, the (now reduced) debt etc and it‚Äôs had their investors depressed like those longing BlackBerry, but me entirely seeing dollar signs because they have the one streaming platform that can by itself face off against Netflix and Disney‚Äôs offerings (who have been doing great), a streaming platform which somehow beat Disney and Hulu to profitability this last quarter.  Not to mention, the release of Sora AI should drastically lower the cost of film production. I hear them say $30 million is a small budget for an animated film? Psssh‚Ä¶. uh, buddy, Dall E charges $0.04 a picture, that‚Äôs ~$4,500 for the number of frames in Toy Story. Where are you getting your frames.   Anyways Sora is developed by OpenAI, which recently worked out a deal with CNN, Warner Bros‚Äô subsidiary, for training data for GPT:  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-10/openai-in-talks-with-cnn-fox-and-time-to-license-content  Which by the way, should be telling of what‚Äôs to come. A sufficiently large library of training data is required for all AI to achieve performance. For LLM‚Äôs like GPT, that‚Äôs well written text. For image AI like Dall E, that‚Äôs well composed pictures and art. For video AI like Sora, I imagine it‚Äôll be well composed video content. Specifically, pre ai-tainted data, as we‚Äôve found AI in AI training data taints the batch: https://bdtechtalks.com/2023/07/17/llm-data-contamination/amp/  Where am I going with this? Well obviously as OpenAI is facing lawsuits due to using copyrighted data for training, they‚Äôre increasingly realizing they‚Äôll have to pay to license that valuable data, as they are with Warner Bros at CNN.  And who has the largest (pre-AI) library of owned,  well composed professional video content in one place? (Alongside evaluation ratings data for said video content)  Disney and Warner Bros.  I don‚Äôt know if they realize it, but those two likely have the highest potential for firm ownership or licensing for higher quality performance video AI models. I heard Zaslav though is a cable obsessed old head so he might need to be swayed by a more modern tech affiliated type to realize this.  This is why I also support the possible merger with Paramount, that sinking ship, even though it‚Äôll result in possible short term debt/chaos, as they say that‚Äôll include DreamWorks and a generally large enough media library to match Disney no question if they don‚Äôt have that already. Plus I think Zaszlav seems like he can handle debt. Owning the most pre-ai media content will soon be king.  Anyways, just my thoughts. Sora AI comes out this year and already exists so the paradigm shift is happening. If it can make even 50% of the movie frames pre-photoshop, it‚Äôll be wild. WBD moon üöÄüöÄ etc  EDIT: Sora transition shot video: https://youtu.be/TAflTfPckQs?si=tEFHP6y3VEFoeDYj  EDIT 2: Tech companies in particular are often valued for the quality of their data. The simple explanation is this: if I have superior data for instance of your internet traffic, I can make a trading AI that trades superior to the market and you. This is a real tactic employed I won‚Äôt say where. Superior data = superior AI performance. For these reasons, data is like Silicon Valley gold, in case you want to know why Google hates your privacy. Conveniently enough, I was an AI Specialist at one of the big tech companies you guys talk about here I won‚Äôt say which one. Recently laid off, which is why I lately have the time for this post.  In any case, if I had to pick one asset to own if I was a machine learning engineer tasked to develop a model to compete with Sora, I‚Äôd pick Warner Bros no contest with their 12,500+ well made films, labeled by production, and tens of thousands of tv shows, etc.  Disney could do well too, with their well stored 6,500,000+ art pieces for their media, however I know for a fact their video content and data skews family friendly. Which might mess up your AI generated concept broody Viking or War film for making it look too much like Frozen. For the more varied and diverse data all in one place, I‚Äôd definitely say Warner Bros wins no question.";"369";"2024-02-29T19:24:27"
"Everyone says NVIDIA is overrated";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ai8ixm/everyone_says_nvidia_is_overrated/";"  The thing is, why would one sell NVIDIA? The company is currently growing at an unprecedented rate and simply dominates the AI market. I believe NVIDIA has been a successful investment in the past because its stock has consistently risen. So, why shouldn't it continue? Every minor dip attracts buyers, and everyone thinks the stock will keep rising, given its historical performance. There's really no reason to sell the stock, either because you believe in the company‚ÄîI certainly do, given that they produce the world's best graphics cards and now lead in AI chips‚Äîor because you want to capitalize on the strong AI boom, which NVIDIA is benefiting from immensely.  Hence, it's challenging to argue that the stock is overvalued. NVIDIA has undergone five stock splits in the past due to consistently high prices, and history might repeat itself. There's no reason why it shouldn't reach the $1,000 mark or even surpass it. If the quarterly reports continue to be fantastic, I'm convinced the stock will hold its ground. The only thing that could weaken the market is if something world-changing happens, such as a chip shortage or political sanctions, whatever it may be.  Or can you tell me why there's constantly talk about the stock being overvalued? Granted, the current price has surged due to the AI boom, everyone is buying into NVIDIA according to various reports. But who says the price isn't justified? And even if it is, I don't expect a significant correction unless the earnings calls turn out poorly, which is not believed to be the case so far.";"185";"2024-02-03T23:48:34"

Nvidia is synonymous to Neural Network training at this point.   4) Most of the money they make, they re-invest in it research so they are ahead of competition by a wide margin.  5) If you used an ai model lately and you liked it, it was most likely trained on an nvidia gpu and inference also happened on an nvidia gpu.  6) Nvidia *really* understands how to do w·µÄx.   7) Why?

Generative AI is fundamentally rewriting our economy.  You need nvidia to make your AI model.   You need nvidia to run your AI model.  You need nvidia to run someone else‚Äôs AI model.   Literally any time you see a company mention generative AI, which is gonna be every single company, they‚Äôre basically announcing to the world they are giving nvidia money.   There is not a single nvidia AI chip available right now. They are all accounted for next two years.   This is based on current perception.  There‚Äôs something very important in AI that you need to remember and that is how when models get larger, they have demonstrated learning abilities that the developers did not specifically teach.  The potential for winner take all outcome is ENORMOUS with AI. FANG is fighting for their lives right now. It is not just google.  If you are concerned about china ban, know that china is only 20% of nvidia revenue, and there is no way China won‚Äôt try to smuggle this earth changing tech at higher prices. /s Those future chips are already sold.  If you are concerned about insider sales, remember that Moderna insiders also sold all the way up, many too early.

"Nvidia $25 billion buyback 'a head-scratcher' for some shareholders.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/160wml4/nvidia_25_billion_buyback_a_headscratcher_for/";"Nvidia's move to repurchase $25 billion in stock after the company's price more than tripled this year caught some investors off guard. Following the company's quarterly revenue projection, which was fuelled by an artificial-intelligence boom, shares reached a record high on Thursday. Nvidia stock rose more than 6% on Thursday, but then fell back to close the day barely changed. However, Nvidia's stock repurchase announcement, the fifth-largest among U.S.-based businesses this year, startled some investors.   Companies usually repurchase stock to return capital to owners, which can help a company's price by lowering supply and raising demand, as well as increase earnings per share. However, Nvidia's stock has increased by over 220% in 2023, leaving investors wondering what is driving the company's decision.   For some investors, a ""undervalued"" Nvidia may be a difficult statement to swallow. As of Wednesday, Nvidia shares were trading at 45 times ahead 12-month profit forecasts, compared to approximately 19 times for the S\&amp:P 500. Tom Plumb, CEO and lead portfolio manager at Plumb Funds, which has Nvidia as one of its major holdings, believes the company may be limited in how it can deploy its resources after its deal to buy chip designer Arm Holdings Ltd fell through last year owing to regulatory worries.   Last year, Nvidia spent roughly 27% of its revenue on research and development, in line with competing chip firms. A request for comment was not immediately returned by the corporation. Nvidia stated in its second-quarter results announcement that its board of directors approved $25 billion in additional share repurchases ""without expiration,"" and that the firm intends to continue repurchases this fiscal year.   Despite the astonishing monetary figure, Nvidia's buyback represented only 2.1% of its over $1.2 trillion market value as of Wednesday, or a buyback yield of 2.1%. Tech businesses prefer to use cash for buybacks rather than dividends since they may be obligated to pay a dividend every quarter, limiting their freedom to capitalize on growth possibilities.";"325";"2023-08-25T13:31:17"

"NVIDIA: No Bubble Yet";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bb8qhr/nvidia_no_bubble_yet/";"TL:DR: NVIDIA is selling the tools for the AI revolution, and every industry will gradually adopt AI, just as the software industry has. This would allow NVIDIA to not only maintain its current revenue growth rate, but even increase it.  *This is the author's opinion only, not financial advice, and is intended for entertainment purposes only. The author holds a beneficial long position in NVIDIA Corp.*  I recently came across a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1b4wlzs/the_spice_must_flow/) here comparing NVIDIA's chips to the *spice* in Frank Herbert's Dune. Quite a refreshing comparison, as the NVIDIA chips required for the new Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a geopolitical resource, with [Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates](https://www.ft.com/content/c93d2a76-16f3-4585-af61-86667c5090ba), for example, buying them at scale for strategic reasons. In Frank Herbert's novels, *spice* enables interstellar travel: in our world, NVIDIA's H100 chips enable artificial intelligence in all its applications. Although competitor AMD recently made progress with the release of its MI300 chips, NVIDIA is still ahead of the race. NVIDIA's H100 remains the gold standard - the *spice* \- for AI infrastructure and is still [superior to AMD's MI300](https://www.forbes.com/sites/karlfreund/2023/12/13/breaking-amd-is-not-the-fastest-gpu-heres-the-real-data/). As a result, NVIDIA maintains an economic moat that it can even widen through [massive investments in research and development](https://www.statista.com/statistics/988048/nvidia-research-and-development-expenses/).  Given the current hype around AI, it is understandable that investors are reminded of the dot-com bubble, but it may be far too early for that. According to George Soros, [stock market bubbles are much more complex](https://www.chaotropy.com/stock-market-why-you-might-not-see-an-ai-bubble-once-its-formed/) than simply inflated price-earnings ratios. After all, it was not a misjudgement of the future impact of the Internet in the late 1990s that led to a bubble, but rather a misjudgement of the time frame in which the Internet could actually increase the productivity and efficiency of our economies. However, the impact of generative AI on businesses and our economy may become measurable much more quickly. The most obvious area of early adoption of generative AI to date has been in computer programming and software development, where it is already happening at breathtaking speed. As early as July 2023, experts at McKinsey estimated that [AI could double the speed of production](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/unleashing-developer-productivity-with-generative-ai) in the software industry. [Thousands of companies](https://aibusiness.com/companies/one-year-on-github-copilot-adoption-soars) are already using Github Copilot, and more than a [million users](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-has-over-a-million-paying-github-copilot-users-ceo-nadella/) are paying for the service. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang [recently predicted](https://www.techradar.com/pro/nvidia-ceo-predicts-the-death-of-coding-jensen-huang-says-ai-will-do-the-work-so-kids-dont-need-to-learn) *""that the programming language is human, everybody in the world is now a programmer. This is the miracle of artificial intelligence""* \- coding is dead. AI will enable a whole new way of interacting with computers. But it's not just about assisting with coding: On March 5, for example, cybersecurity company Crowdstrike released its fiscal year 2024 results, reporting better than expected revenue and guidance. A key product is Charlotte AI, an artificial intelligence that democratizes cybersecurity management by enabling natural language interaction.  More exciting for NVIDIA's future, however, are the areas where generative AI has not yet been adopted at scale. For example, while there seems to be a [consensus on the potential of AI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01614-0), there has been little to no day-to-day application of AI in healthcare and medicine. We are still a long way from AI actually performing diagnostics, making diagnoses, interpreting medical imaging or histopathology slides, or even performing interventions on patients in the everyday world. AI could also soon revolutionize [research in the chemical industry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2023/10/24/how-gen-ai-empowers-human-innovation-in-the-chemical-industry/), simplify processes in old heavy industries, create all kinds of content for movies and video games or even turn government bureaucracies upside down. For example, the city of Heidelberg in southern Germany is already [experimenting with an AI chatbot](https://www.heidelberg.de/Digitale-Stadt/startseite/projekte/ki-buergerassistenz+lumi.html) (Lumi by Aleph Alpha) to help people deal with government agencies and answer questions about the complex German bureaucracy. In my opinion, it is foreseeable that sooner or later AI will find its way into every niche of our civilization.  NVIDIA is selling the basic tools for this revolution, and every industry will gradually adopt generative AI, just as the software industry has. As if that were not enough of a tailwind, the next bitcoin halving is approaching (likely in April 2024). Mining bitcoins will then become more computationally intensive, which should further increase demand for NVIDIA's energy-efficient GPU chips. All of this could allow NVIDIA to not only maintain its current revenue growth rate (recently reported revenue growth was 126% year-over-year), but even increase that rate. Of course, that's hard to imagine with NVIDIA's current market cap of more than $2 trillion, or as physicist Albert A. Bartlett once wrote: *""The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function.""* Remember what they say in the world of Dune? - *""The spice must flow.""*  This post can also be found [here](https://www.chaotropy.com/nvidia-no-bubble-yet/) or [here (Medium)](https://medium.com/@chaotropy/nvidia-no-bubble-yet-631ca3b887d2).";"18";"2024-03-10T13:00:21"

"NVIDIA will cross 2,000$";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1arrumb/nvidia_will_cross_2000/";"NVIDIA is going to cross 2,000$  Listen up regards, today lord Sam 7 trillion Altman of OpenAI released an AI model to send YouTube creators out of business. (Link : https://openai.com/sora) Ok, YouTubers will soon run out of Tendies, how does this mean NVIDIA will reach 2000$ you ask?   Well to see the connection you need to understand a bit of AI. There are 2 big models that currently exist: Transformers and Diffusion. The thing about transformers is that they operate on tokens. For language a bunch of letters together form a token. ‚Äúab‚Äù can be 1 token, ‚Äúcan‚Äù another token and so on. Basically they do not think in terms of single alphabets but actually think in terms of tokens. So OpenAI took 100 million Microsoft bucks, 1 billion+ NVIDIA GPU‚Äôs and created ChatGPT that started this AI bull run.   Then came the question how to apply this technique to images. Naively each image generates far more tokens than a thousand word essay and so understanding an image seems extremely inefficient. Transformers will not work, smooth brained critics said. Then Sam Altman pulled the infinite money Microsoft glitch and OpenAI trained a massively large transformer on an ungodly number of GPUs and showed we could perfectly understand images with GPT-4.   ‚ÄúWell ok maybe images work, but this will never work for videos, that would require an insane amount of compute‚Äù, smooth brained critics said. It turns out these critics just lacked imagination since Sam Altman proceeded to ask for 7 trillion dollars, more than the GDP of every country except US and China to throw more compute at AI. So when OpenAI says they will just brute force AI, throw trillions of compute at it and achieve AGI you better believe them. They have now come out with a transformer based Video Diffusion model. They never mentioned how big this model is, but it is probably bigger than GPT-4 . GPT-5 which is rumored to be able to understand and answer questions on video, is probably one order of magnitude bigger than GPT-4 and might cost 1 billion + to train. This means the market is still significantly underestimating the demand for NVIDIA chips and NVIDIAs price target should be 2000$ + in coming future.  TLDR: OpenAI‚Äôs foray into video using transformers shows there is far more compute they can use to generate even better AI‚Äôs. They will probably buy 10X the compute they already bought, from NVIDIA in the coming years in their quest to build AI. NVIDIA will skyrocket as a result.";"2";"2024-02-15T23:12:18"
"üöÄüöÄ GETY + NVIDIA = MOON! Why Getty Images is the Next Tendie Factory üöÄüöÄ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16vg5n7/gety_nvidia_moon_why_getty_images_is_the_next/";"What's up you degenerate apes? ü¶ç Listen up, because I've got a hot take that could be your ticket to Tendie Town. I'm talking about Getty Images (GETY), the company that's been hoarding every photo you've ever seen like a dragon sitting on a pile of gold. üêâüí∞  ### Why Getty?  1. **Monopoly Money**: These guys practically have a monopoly on stock photos. You need a pic of a sad businessman staring at a sandwich? Getty's got you. A happy family eating salad? Getty. They've got it all, and they're charging through the nose for it. 2. **Diversification**: They're not just about photos anymore. They've got videos, music, and even digital art. It's like they're building the Infinity Gauntlet of digital media. 3. **Subscription Model**: They've got a subscription service that's stickier than the floor at a movie theater. Once companies get in, they can't get out. Recurring revenue, baby! 4. **NVIDIA Partnership**: Hold onto your butts, because Getty just announced a partnership with NVIDIA to release a generative AI program. As we all know, NVIDIA is a WSB darling, and this partnership could send both stocks to the moon! üåï  ### The Numbers üìà  I can't give you real-time numbers because I'm not a wizard, but let's just say their revenue has been growing like a weed, and they're more profitable than a casino in Vegas.  ### The Play üé≤  * **Long Calls**: If you're a true WSB degenerate, you're already thinking about YOLOing some long calls. Just remember, options are risky, and you could lose it all. * **Stock**: If you're a boomer or just risk-averse, buying the stock outright isn't a bad play either. * **Short Puts**: If you're bullish but want to collect some premium, consider selling some puts. Just make sure you're ready to own the stock if it dips.  ### Risks üìâ  1. **Regulation**: If governments start cracking down on copyright laws or something, Getty could take a hit. 2. **Competition**: There's always a risk that some startup could come in and disrupt the market. But let's be real, Getty is the 800-pound gorilla in the room. 3. **Market Conditions**: We're in a volatile market, so anything could happen. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.  Alright, you smooth-brained animals, that's my DD. Do your own research, and let's ride this rocket to the moon! üöÄüöÄ  **Disclaimer**: This is not financial advice. I'm just a random internet person. Always do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.";"579";"2023-09-29T18:25:02"
"Nvidia stock breaks out, flashing bullish sign, with earnings due ‚Äî Is it a buy?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/15y0hmo/nvidia_stock_breaks_out_flashing_bullish_sign/";"Nvidia ($NVDA), a data center and gaming behemoth, remains hot. The chipmaker is often regarded as one of the greatest beneficiaries of the AI revolution. Is Nvidia stock a buy after breaking over a critical level on Monday, with earnings anticipated later this week?  Nvidia is scheduled to disclose its fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, following a quarter of stellar performance and outsized AI-driven guidance. Analysts at KeyBanc, HSBC, and Baird have boosted their price targets on Nvidia stock, joining over ten other Wall Street firms in doing so in the last week. Wall Street is looking to Nvidia's guidance for 2023 and 2024 to determine the underlying demand and growth direction of AI spending. Nvidia revealed its next-generation AI super processor, the GH200, in August, with the goal of targeting the expanding generative AI sector.  https://preview.redd.it/29fls97fqmjb1.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=65dbb63bb7176bbd921f465bb6bed48b1708cd41  Despite the stock market's ""in correction"" position, Nvidia has outperformed growth equities in general. On August 21, the relative strength line reached a new high, and Nvidia joined the renowned IBD Leaderboard in February due to an earnings gap-up. Nvidia stock has risen more than 221% year to far, reaching a 52-week high on July 14. Nvidia receives an IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of a maximum of 99, putting it in the top 4% of all companies in terms of technical and fundamental indicators. Investors should prioritize stocks with Comp Ratings of 90 or above.  Nvidia, situated in Santa Clara, California, has issued a bullish, AI-fueled sales projection for the first quarter, earning $1.09 per share on sales of $7.19 billion. Despite a 20% year-on-year reduction in profitability and a 13% drop in revenue, the company's results exceeded Wall Street's forecasts. Sales of data centers increased 14% to $4.28 billion, while sales of gaming chips decreased 38% to $2.24 billion. Analysts now predict that Nvidia's earnings will increase 148% this year, while sales will increase 65%. Nvidia's history includes developing graphics processing units (GPUs) to improve the realism of video games, extending into AI chips used in supercomputers, data centers, and medication discovery, and working on ""supercomputers"" that combine its own CPUs and GPUs. Nvidia chips are also employed in cryptocurrency mining and self-driving electric vehicles. The fabless category is ranked 21st out of 197 industry groups, with competitors such as QCOM, Broadcom, and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR).  ## Is Nvidia Stock A Buy?  Because of brisk chip sales for data centers and artificial intelligence, Nvidia's earnings are likely to more than double this fiscal year. The business is moving into automated electric vehicles and cloud gaming, and the adoption of the metaverse and cryptocurrencies might increase demand for Nvidia chips even further. However, macroeconomic uncertainty and the potential of a worldwide recession continue to exist. Nvidia stock has nearly tripled by 2023, but the AI chip leader's earnings later this week, as well as overall market conditions, should be taken into account before making any fresh investments.

Honestly, I don't even want to speculate about how it'll turn out. What I do know is that, [regardless of the outcome](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/15t11yg/red_pill_and_blue_pill_which_one_do_you_choose/), I'll have an edge against both those betting on the continuation of the AI rally and those anticipating a bubble burst.  I've set up a win-win strategy. I bought 8 09/15 Calls at $475 and sold a few 08/25 Calls for a certain price.  If NVDA does climb post-report, which I find doubtful, I'll profit from the calls I've purchased. Of course, I've hedged against the opposite scenario, which I believe is more likely ‚Äì NVDA dropping below $400. For that, I've secured 2 ratio-spreads (1:3) from $375 to $300.  All in all, I ended up with a credit of $4376 on an allocated $50k for this strategy.

"Nvidia chases $30 billion custom chip market with new unit";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1amo3hn/nvidia_chases_30_billion_custom_chip_market_with/";"Nvidia NVDA  is building a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for  cloud computing firms and others, including advanced artificial  intelligence processors, according to nine sources familiar with the  company's plans.  The dominant global designer and  supplier of AI chips aims to capture a portion of an exploding market  for custom AI chips and to protect itself from the growing number of  companies interested in finding alternatives to its products.  The  Santa Clara, California-based company currently controls about 80% of  the market for high-end AI chips, a position that has sent its market  value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than  tripled in 2023.  Its customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOG and Meta Platforms META, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of Nvidia chips to compete in the rapidly emerging generative AI sector.  Nvidia's  H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor  for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started  to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. Doing so helps  reduce energy consumption, and potentially can shrink the cost and time  to design.  Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in  helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to  rival firms such as Broadcom AVGO and Marvell Technology MRVL, according to the sources who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  ""If  you're really trying to optimize on things like power, or optimize on  cost for your application, you can't afford to go drop an H100 or A100  in there,"" Greg Reichow, general partner at venture capital firm Eclipse  Ventures said in an interview. ""You want to have the exact right  mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need.""  Nvidia does not disclose H100 prices, which are higher than for the  prior-generation A100, but each chip can sell from $16,000 to $100,000  depending on the volume purchased and other factors. Meta has said it  plans to bring its total stock to 350,000 H100s this year.  Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon .com AMZN,  Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for  them, according to two sources familiar with the meetings. Beyond data  center chips, the company has pursued telecom, automotive and video game  customers.  In 2022, Nvidia said it would let  third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking  technology with their own chips. The company has said nothing about the  program since, and Reuters is reporting its wider ambitions for the  first time.  A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company's 2022 announcement.  Dina McKinney, a former Advanced Micro Devices AMD  and Marvell executive, heads Nvidia's custom unit and her team's goal  is to make its technology available for customers in cloud, 5G wireless,  video games and automotives, according to a LinkedIn profile. Those  mentions were scrubbed and her title was changed after Reuters sought  comment from Nvidia.  Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment.  $30 BILLION MARKET  According  to estimates from research firm 650 Group‚Äôs Alan Weckel, the data  center custom chip market will grow to as much as $10 billion this year,  and double that in 2025.  The broader custom chip market  was worth roughly $30 billion in 2023, which amounts to roughly 5% of  annual global chip sales, according to Needham analyst Charles Shi.  Currently, custom silicon design for data centers is dominated by Broadcom and Marvell.  In  a typical arrangement, a design partner such as Nvidia would offer  intellectual property and technology, but leave the chip fabrication,  packaging and additional steps to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  2330 or another contract chip manufacturer.  Nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into Broadcom and Marvell sales.  ""With  Broadcom's custom silicon business touching $10 billion, and Marvell‚Äôs  around $2 billion, this is a real threat,"" said Dylan Patel, founder of  the silicon research group SemiAnalysis. ""It's a real big negative -  there's more competition entering the fray.""  BEYOND AI  Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson 61QS  for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics  processing unit (GPU) technology, according to two sources familiar with  the talks.  650 Group's Weckle expects the telecom custom chip market to remain flat at roughly $4 billion to $5 billion a year.  Ericsson declined to comment.  Nvidia also plans to target the automotive and video game markets, according to sources and public social media postings.  Weckel  expects the custom auto market to grow consistently from its current $6  billion to $8 billion range at 20% a year, and the $7 billion to $8  billion video game custom chip market could increase with the  next-generation consoles from Xbox and Sony 6857.  Nintendo‚Äôs  current Switch handheld console already includes an Nvidia chip, the  Tegra X1. A new version of the Switch console expected this year is  likely to include a Nvidia custom design, according to one source.

"Is Nvidia Overvalued? AVGO Boasts 62% Higher Net Income than NVDA, Yet with a 65% Lower Market Cap?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/14orfd1/is_nvidia_overvalued_avgo_boasts_62_higher_net/";"In the rapidly evolving world of technology, NVIDIA has emerged as a leading player in the semiconductor industry. Known for its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the company has garnered significant attention from investors. However, in the current economic environment, there are growing concerns that NVIDIA‚Äôs stock may be overvalued. This article delves into various factors, including economic indicators, company fundamentals and comparable examples , to provide a comprehensive analysis of why NVIDIA‚Äôs stock valuation may be inflated.   As a cyclical stock, the global economy plays a crucial role in determining the performance and valuation of a company like NVIDIA. Considering economic indicators such as GDP growth rates showing signs of moderation, reflecting a potential slowdown in overall economic activity. Additionally, inflationary pressures and interest rate adjustments have introduced uncertainties into the market. These factors can impact investor sentiment and the valuation of companies, including NVIDIA.  To evaluate NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation, we need to examine its fundamental aspects. The company‚Äôs financial profile reveals key information:  Examining NVIDIA‚Äôs quarterly income statement reveals a mix of sales growth and decline over the past five quarters. The most recent quarter, ending on April 30, 2023, saw a substantial increase in sales with a growth rate of 18.86%. However, the preceding quarters experienced more varied results, including modest growth, a decline, and a significant drop in sales.  These fluctuations in sales growth suggest that NVIDIA‚Äôs revenue stream may not be consistently expanding. Such volatility can impact the company‚Äôs overall valuation, especially when combined with the high P/E ratio of 219.84 mentioned earlier. Investors should be cautious when evaluating the stock‚Äôs current valuation, considering the mixed performance shown in the income statement.  	1.	Market Capitalization: NVIDIA‚Äôs market cap stands at a staggering $1.04 trillion, highlighting its prominence in the market. However, a high market cap alone does not guarantee that a stock is fairly valued. 	2.	Earnings Per Share (EPS): NVIDIA‚Äôs EPS for the most recent fiscal year was reported at $1.92. While this figure appears solid, a deeper analysis is necessary to assess its significance in relation to the stock‚Äôs valuation. 	3.	Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: The P/E ratio for NVIDIA is an eye-opening 219.84, indicating a substantial premium investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. A high P/E ratio could suggest overvaluation if not adequately supported by other factors.  To assess NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation further, it is prudent to compare the company‚Äôs financial indicators to those of its competitors within the semiconductor sector, namely AMD, Micron, and AVGO.  AMD, with an EPS of 0.24 and a market capitalization of $183.44 billion, exhibits a notably lower valuation compared to NVIDIA. However, the semiconductor industry‚Äôs current fame and widespread recognition may contribute to inflated valuations across the sector.  Micron‚Äôs negative EPS of -2.68 and market capitalization of $69.12 billion indicate weaker financial performance when compared to NVIDIA and AMD. As a result, Micron may not serve as an accurate benchmark for evaluating NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation.  AVGO, another prominent player in the semiconductor sector, boasts a healthy EPS of 31.64 and a P/E ratio of 27.41. With a market capitalization of $357.98 billion, AVGO appears to be favorably valued relative to its earnings, further highlighting the need for careful evaluation within the semiconductor sector.  Comparing AVGO‚Äôs Annual Income Statement with NVDA‚Äôs provides valuable insights into the financial performance of both companies:  AVGO Annual Income Statement:  	‚Ä¢	2022 Sales/Revenue: $33,203 million 	‚Ä¢	2022 Net Income: $11,495 million  NVDA Annual Income Statement:  	‚Ä¢	2023 Sales/Revenue: $26,974 million 	‚Ä¢	2023 Net Income: $4,368 million  Looking at the revenue figures, AVGO has consistently shown higher sales/revenue over the past five years. In 2022, AVGO reported sales of $33,203 million, while NVDA reported sales of $26,974 million.  In terms of net income, AVGO has also demonstrated strong performance. In 2022, AVGO reported a net income of $11,495 million, indicating robust profitability. On the other hand, NVDA reported a net income of $4,368 million in 2023, which is notably lower than AVGO‚Äôs net income.  These figures suggest that AVGO has consistently outperformed NVDA in terms of both revenue and net income. The higher revenue and stronger profitability of AVGO further reinforce the argument that NVIDIA may be overvalued when compared to AVGO.  Taking into account the prevailing economic challenges and the potential impact on the semiconductor sector, there are indications that NVIDIA‚Äôs current valuation may be inflated. The semiconductor industry, including NVIDIA, has gained significant attention due to its critical role in emerging technologies and the ongoing digital revolution. However, widespread recognition and market enthusiasm can contribute to elevated valuations.  Given the factors discussed above, including the mixed sales growth, high P/E ratio, and comparisons to industry peers, there is a compelling case to suggest that NVIDIA‚Äôs stock may experience a sharp price decline in the near future. The current economic environment, with signs of a slowdown in overall economic activity and uncertainties surrounding inflation and interest rates, adds further weight to this analysis.  While the company‚Äôs prominence in the semiconductor industry is undeniable, the potential for overvaluation cannot be overlooked. The market cap of $1.04 trillion alone does not guarantee fair valuation, and the EPS and P/E ratio indicate a premium investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.  While the stock has enjoyed significant attention and growth, there are indications that it is overvalued. In conclusion, it is crucial for investors to assess NVIDIA‚Äôs stock valuation critically, taking into account the economic landscape, company fundamentals, and industry trends.";"307";"2023-07-02T17:43:59"

Chips that were purchased include Nvidia's (NVDA) A100, H100, A800 and H800 chips, whose exports to China were banned by the U.S.  The buyers include the state-run Harbin Institute of Technology and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, both of which allegedly have military ties.  Other buyers include Tsinghua University, a laboratory run by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, as well as an unnamed People's Liberation Army entity.  While the tenders show that most of the chips are being used for AI, the number of chips bought so far are too small to build an AI large language model from scratch.

"Story Time - Nvidia, CoreWeave, Magnetard Capital and the Next Bubble to Pop";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/169z9dm/story_time_nvidia_coreweave_magnetard_capital_and/";"Gather round for some Big Short, Margin Call level shit...  The goal of this post isn't to accuse any financial firm or Nvidia of breaking any laws because we all know our existing laws let the big dogs do whatever the fuck they want with zero consequences. It's to start figuring out whether we're really on the precipice of the next AI revolution (probably not given how a cone can stop a Cruise car from moving and Elon's FSD ran a red light on stream), or the next mania induced bubble.  &#x200B:  * 2001 .com bubble * 2008 MBS bubble * 2017 crypto bubble * 2021 SPAC/NFT trash bubble * 2023 AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI bubble????  If you've read this far, then have I got a timeline for you....  &#x200B:  Magnetard Capital is a hedge fund who helped exacerbate the 2008 financial crisis by putting together extremely toxic subprime mortgages and then betting against them via CDOs. They're known within wall street as one of the more deplorable hedge funds to exist. And it makes some sense, as the founder and CEO of Magnetard Capital, Alec Litowitz, comes from a hedge fund we all know and love, Ken Griffin‚Äôs Citadel LLC.  * [The Magnetar Trade: How One Hedge Fund Helped Keep the Bubble Going](https://www.propublica.org/article/all-the-magnetar-trade-how-one-hedge-fund-helped-keep-the-housing-bubble) * [A Fund Behind Astronomical Losses](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120027155742887331)  Fine, but what does this have to do with Nvidia and CoreWeave?  &#x200B:  CoreWeave was originally called **Hudson Ridge Asset Management** and founded in 2012 by three former natural gas futures traders (Enron vibes anyone?) turned crypto bros who renamed their company **The Atlantic Crypto Corporation** in 2017 to capitalize on the burgeoning retail crypto bubble.  After riding that fad into the ground, they pivoted from ETH mining and renamed themselves **CoreWeave** on October 28 2021.  Two weeks after CoreWeave was founded, **Magnetard Capital** invests $50 million into CoreWeave despite the two week old company having no patents, products, or anything of substance. That same day, **Nvidia** announces CoreWeave is now an Nvidia Elite Partner for Compute. Strange.  Nov 2022 - **ChatGPT** becomes the new fad everyone can‚Äôt stop talking about, especially your creepy bald uncle who wants to know if ""the AI"" can write erotic novellas, hypothetically of course...  Dec 2022 - **CoreWeave** secures another $100 million from **Magnetard Capital.** Again, CoreWeave has no products, patents, or services.  April 2023 - **CoreWeave** gets another $221 million led by **Magnetard Capital** and Nvidia as a secondary investor.  May 2023 - **CoreWeave** secures $200 million in a series B extension, bringing the total **Magnetard Capital** has invested in CoreWeave to nearly half a billion dollars.  August 3 2023 - [CoreWeave announces they‚Äôve raised 2.3 billion in debt from Magnetard Capital, Blackstone, BlackRock, and some other shady financial firms, all collateralized by Nvidia H100 chips](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/coreweave-raises-2-3-billion-in-debt-collateralized-by-nvidia-chips/articleshow/102396035.cms?) (meaning they bought 2.3 billion dollars worth of H100 chips prior to this debt agreement, presumably before Nvidia's Q2 closed at the end of July 2023).

"Ultimate Nvidia DD (The Best)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1asejqq/ultimate_nvidia_dd_the_best/";"First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens.      It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark.   No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space.  First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently?  You could say it‚Äôs because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood.   It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT.  AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks.  How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype?   Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it‚Äôs not just any Product. It‚Äôs a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.   An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand.  This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).  This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW.  They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party.  How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else.  Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts:  \- Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees  \- Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to)  \- Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development)  \- Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers  The Analogy:  ‚ÄûPrivate customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood).  TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees.  The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.  At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture.  Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.  Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market.  What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process.  Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.‚Äú        \----  NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips.  Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that‚Äôs their moat. This tells me that the person doesn‚Äôt know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture.  NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They ‚Äûonly‚Äú design them.  Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It‚Äôs TSMC.   TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple.  So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big ‚ÄûChip Design Company‚Äú. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult ‚Äúmoat‚Äù part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them.  There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.  So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel.   Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD?   This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design.  Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough.  AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips.  Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they‚Äôre building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again.  According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.  Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?!  Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so:  ‚ÄûHowever, in 2010, **Apple** made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple‚Äôs GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration.  Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple‚Äôs commitment to developing its own graphics technology.‚Äú ([Does Apple use Nvidia?

As of February 13, 2024 Nvidia has a P/E ratio of 95.24 which may seem high and it totally is understandable. Company seems overweight, compared to competitors such as Intel who have or P/E ratio of 107.63 or AMD 326.41. Compared to competitors they are not as over valued.   Lets compare Nvidia with other companies around its market cap. Amazon has a P/E ratio of 58.16. The difference between Amazon and Nvidia is Nvidia is bound for more growth in the near future with the boom of AI which they control the AI chip market by a crazy 80%. What about their financials, last quarter Nvidia had 18.12 Total Revenue with a net income of 9.24 billion. Amazon had 143.08 billion with net income of 9.88 billion. Nvidia has a huge profit margin of 51.01% compared to Amazon's measly  6.9%. No doubt Amazon is trying to create a bigger net profit margin but so would Nvidia.   Recently Canada had signed a letter of intent to engage in business with Nvidia. Recent CEO Huang discussed that not only is Canada prioritizing AI infrastructure but also Japan, France, South Korea, Malaysia, Italy and Britain. This tells us that countries want to buy these chips from producers around the world which Nvidia are currently leading. Only problem is supply chain issues.  With this kind of demand meeting supply is dificult. Hopefully Nvidia is able to capitalize this and meet this enormous demand with increased prices to maximize revenue.  Nvidia is setting foot in creating energy efficient computing for AI. They are making custom chips for clients such as Meta, Amazon, etc... To become more efficient in specific needs for each clients. This opens up multiple new paths for increased revenue. Not just that Nvidia is creating Gpu's for the consumers which compute the power for AI, of course enough power to game and design.  \---**Major current buyers:**  * **Cloud giants:**    * **Meta:** A major spender, reportedly purchasing billions of dollars worth of H100 chips for their Metaverse ambitions and AI development.    * **Microsoft:** Another big investor, aiming to power cloud services and its Azure AI platform with Nvidia's tech.    * **Amazon:** Utilizing Nvidia chips for their AWS cloud services and internal AI endeavors.    * **Google:** While Google develops its own AI chips, they also leverage Nvidia's technology for specific applications. * **Tech companies:**    * **Baidu:** China's tech giant is reportedly a significant buyer, using Nvidia chips for AI research and development.    * **Tencent:** Another Chinese tech player heavily invested in AI, likely utilizing Nvidia's chips for various projects.    * **Alibaba:** Their spending details are less transparent, but they're likely in the mix due to their extensive AI efforts.    * **Dell:** As a major PC and server manufacturer, they incorporate Nvidia GPUs in their offerings, contributing to Nvidia's sales.  \---**Potential future buyers:**  * **Other cloud providers:** Companies like IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud could increasingly turn to Nvidia chips for their AI offerings. * **Startups and smaller companies:** As AI gains traction in various industries, adoption of Nvidia's technology by smaller players is expected to grow. * **Governments:** For projects in areas like national security, healthcare, and research, governments could become significant buyers.  \---**Global reach, with limitations:**  * Nvidia does aim for widespread sales, reaching numerous countries across the globe. They have customers in various regions, including North America, Europe, Asia, and more.  \---**Export controls and restrictions:**  * However, Nvidia needs to adhere to export control regulations set by the US government, where they're headquartered. These regulations might restrict sales to specific countries or for certain uses.  **Examples of restrictions:**  * In October 2023, the US implemented restrictions on selling their most advanced AI chips to China, aiming to prevent their use for military or other sensitive applications. * Similar restrictions might apply to other countries in the future, depending on evolving policies. * Such restrictions can reduce sales but they weren't selling much to China either way. Now they sell chips with slightly less computing power.  **Upcoming potential announcements (based on rumors and speculations):**  * **GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs:** While not officially confirmed, new consumer graphics cards are expected sometime in 2024 or 2025, likely offering further performance boosts for gamers. * **Next-gen DRIVE autonomous vehicle platform:** Nvidia's self-driving technology is constantly evolving, and the next iteration of the DRIVE platform might bring significant advancements. * **New AI chips:** Beyond the recently released H100, Nvidia is likely working on even more powerful and specialized AI chips for various applications.

"AMD is disrupting Nvidia";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18mqopg/amd_is_disrupting_nvidia/";"   $AMD is set up to take a lot of market share from $NVDA for 2 reasons:  1.Much of of $NVDA ¬¥s moat stems from CUDA, which enables developers to interact with $NVDA GPUs seamlessly when coding.  However, Pytorch has become the dominant framework for deep learning (AI) and now, $AMD GPUs work out of the box on Pytorch.  This opens the veil for $AMD to disrupt $NVDA ¬¥s software moat and levels the playing field.  2. $NVDA ¬¥s chips are monolithic, while $AMD ¬¥s chips are chiplet based. Chiplets have enabled $AMD to disrupt $INTC by yielding high performing but cheap chips.  This is because when you make a chip out of chiplets, if one of the components goes wrong you don¬¥t have to throw the entire thing away. Hence, yields are much higher than in monolithic architectures.  I believe the same is going to happen on the GPU side.  Chiplets have lower margins and so pivoting to this would hurt $NVDA ¬¥s financials: a clear case of the Innovator¬¥s Dilemma. $NVDA has a fantastic business and will hardly find the incentives to disrupt itself moving towards chiplets.  In combination, a democratization of deep learning development tools with $AMD coming into the GPU space with its chiplet capabilities bodes well for $AMD to grow its market share.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/4k603wwf5f7c1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=76ea5583a4a30dcca6291eee0c39e3d6147aef0a";"4";"2023-12-20T10:30:12"

I gave you the AMD DD yesterday ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1biqt1k/dd\_i\_ddd\_the\_nvidia\_run\_up\_last\_year\_250700\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1biqt1k/dd_i_ddd_the_nvidia_run_up_last_year_250700_and/)). I liked reading all the insight from people smarter than me and the regardation in the comments, thank you for that. **I'm here today to talk about the B200 because it came up a lot. What I'm going to show is that AMD will still sell a lot of MI300Xs even when it comes out.**  First let me say the B200 is great and will be the leader, and will sell a gazillions. However, for whatever reason Nvidia decided to make their stats and metrics highly misleading in their announcement, especially for laymen who don't know what the fuck they are looking at and just see big numbers and monkey brain instincts kick in. The B200 and GB200 do have a sizeable lead on the MI300X, but its not 4x or 1000x or whatever I was seeing in the comments. **The raw performance difference from MI300X to B200 is 90% for FLOPs and 51% for memory bandwidth. The B200 has 36% more transistors than the MI300X, so it is simply a larger chip (by transistor) and that accounts for a lot of the difference. AMD can scale their next chip up if they want more FLOPs and memory bandwidth too.**  Basically the issues with Nvidia's announcement boil down to 1) not revealing their methodology, 2) doing apples to oranges comparisons, and 3) giving metrics that are intentionally misleading so people watching do apples to oranges comparisons.  I'm not going to cover everything, but I will just give a quick rundown of how I got to my numbers. We are going to use these two pages:  [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb200-nvl72/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb200-nvl72/)  [https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300/mi300x.html](https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300/mi300x.html)  First lets define what we are talking about.  **MI300X**  The MI300X is basically like a giant GPU. Up to 8 of them fit in a big computer that goes in a rack in a datacenter. They are connected to the server using PCIE like your graphics card, but are also interconnected with each other using Infinity Fabric cables. Infinity Fabric is important because it allows the cards to bypass the CPU when transferring data from one card to another. AMD's metrics are for one card.  **GB200**  The GB200 is a giant two-rack computer. It is made up of 72 individual graphics cards and 36 CPUs. Nvidia's version of Infinity Fabric is called NVLink, and all of the 72 GPUs and 36 CPUs are all connected to one another using NVLink. This is the largest interconnection of its kind, which is the impressive part of the GB200. Nvlink also can connect multiple GB200s together so all of their GPUs can talk with one another. **This scale of Nvlink is really the killer app of the GB200, not the chips.**   In Nvidia's marketing material, it shows metrics for one whole GB200 system and also for one GB200 ""superchip"" which includes 2 GPUs and a CPU. Superchip is intentionally misleading though, because its 3 separate chips on a board (and one is a CPU), not one big chip.  [2x GB200 \\""superchips\\"" each with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU](https://preview.redd.it/p7tbzgfz4jpc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=532d5df2b4c2e87d88a4415d7d52aeec7d3a4474)  **B200**  The B200 is a single giant GPU. Its probably something like what each of the GPUs on the ""superchips"" are, but we don't know for sure. Either way its a single chip like the MI300X. I'm going to call the GPUs on the superchips B200s for simplicity sake.  # Nvidia's Long Green Dick Bar Charts  I've looked through all of these, and they are all almost completely meaningless other than as trend indicators. They don't tell you even what metrics are being shown other than a two word description. Forget testing methodologies and all the details needed to understand them. I can tell you that the massive NVLink setup in the GB200 is going to lead to huge efficiency and clustering improvements, but on an individual chip basis, there is not as big of a difference between the B200 and the H200 or MI300X other than size.  # Comparing apples-to-apples  The MI300X's specs are plainly available, but nvidia hasn't released all of them for the B200 yet. Nvidia does give us 10 PFLOPs per ""superchip"" of 16 bit floating point with sparsity (this is a common type of number for AI) and AMD gives us 2.61 PFLOPs per card.  https://preview.redd.it/ujbwkv675jpc1.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=56864fb260223e857a5ee840de9513cb4c1f8d5a  Remember, the ""superchip"" is actually 3 chips on a board: a CPU and two GPUs. The CPU on the GB200 superchip is probably providing a minuscule amount of FP16 compared to the GPUs, so we can just divide the number by 2 to get 5. **So that's the best metric we can get right now: 2.61 AMD vs 5 Nvidia (FP16 PFLOPs w/ sparsity) or 90% more.**  # Memory Bandwidth  For LLM inference, or what happens when you type ""tldr this wsb post:"" into chatgpt, memory bandwidth is the most important bottleneck. Nvidia gives us a comparable figure for this: 16 TB/s for 2 GPUs or 8 TB/s per B200. The MI300X has 5.3 TB/s of memory bandwidth, **so the B200 is running with 51% more memory bandwidth.**  # Yes its good, but not out of this world  The new nvidia chips coming out later this year are a solid generational move and will be great for customers. **However there is no magic, and most of their per-chip performance increase from previous nvidia chips is because they are a lot larger. The H100 and H200 are 80B transistors, the MI300X is 153B transistors, and this new B200 is 208B transistors.** There is no magic with the new B200 other than it is a lot bigger in terms of transistor count and has slightly smaller more efficient transistors.  **The real killer app of the B200 is the way it can be combined with hundreds or thousands of other B200s using NVLink. AMD does have Infinity Fabric which connects 8 GPUs, but they haven't done this scale of integration yet. However its a reasonable assumption AMD can scale Infinity Link in the same way, so this isn't putting AMD out of the question for its next generation.**  # Where does the MI300X fit in?  Read my other post for more details about the AMD value proposition, but I'll do a quick summary here. **Remember that the MI300X is probably currently the leader in performance and will be until the B200 comes out. That gives it 9 months give or take at the top.** However, it does not need to remain the leader to sell in a volume that will be a huge increase in revenue and profit for AMD. There are plenty of niches that the MI300X does fill that the B200 doesn't. For instance the MI300X does have over double the 64 bit floating point performance of the B200. 64 bit floats are used in scientific modelling but not in AI. Presumably Nvidia will release another card that competes for general compute performance, but the MI300X does both AI and large scale compute well. Also for smaller deployments that can't leverage NVLink's large scaling efficiencies, the MI300X can easily make sense. The MI300X does have a similar interconnect at 8-card scale with Infinity Fabric. Also its likely companies will pick up the MI300X simply to diversify so Nvidia doesn't have negotiating leverage on them or because they want to reduce supply chain risk. Lastly AMD can always drop the price and still have a huge profit margin. **Its easy for me to imagine a 15% AMD AI accelerator market share with the B200 existing for these reasons.**  Furthermore, none of the additions from the GB200 or B200 are serious moats for Nvidia that AMD can't cross. **AMD can scale up its chip transistor counts, add more stacks of HBM, and scale Infinity Link in the same way. The GB200 is great, but it does not represent a hurdle AMD can't cross.**";"53";"2024-03-20T19:37:00"
"If you missed the NVDA train, buy ARM";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1b8499a/if_you_missed_the_nvda_train_buy_arm/";"Summary: I fully expect Nvidia and Jensen Huang to go after ARM and acquire a (rather large) stake at any moment, possibly as soon as lockup expires next week. If Trump wins election and FTC changes leadership, Nvidia will likely try to acquire ARM outright.   Background: In late September 2020, [Nvidia announced plans to acquire ARM from Softbank](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-for-40-billion-creating-worlds-premier-computing-company-for-the-age-of-ai) for $40 billion. At that time, NVDA was \~ $400 billion company, 10x the value of ARM. In December 2021, the [FTC sues to block the merger](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-sues-block-40-billion-semiconductor-chip-merger) citing anti-competitive advantages the combined firm would do in the AI race. On February 2022, Nvidia and Softbank announce [the termination of Nvidia acquitition of ARM Holdings](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-softbank-group-announce-termination-of-nvidias-acquisition-of-arm-limited) and Softbank immediately announced plans to IPO ARM. ARM would IPO in September of 2023.   All the major tech companies in the world (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom, AMD, META, Tesla, and many many others) are working to design their own chips, most are based on [ARM architecture](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/11/09/how-arm-gained-chip-dominance-with-apple-nvidia-amazon-and-qualcomm.html) and Jensen Huang sees the writing on the wall. Jensen also knows that his main competitors, including some of the big boys, are also champing at the bit to either get their own stake or prevent Nvidia from cornering the entire market outright. It's a race against the inevitable.   If Nvidia was successful in acquiring ARM back in 2021, those $40 billion NVDA shares would be worth $220 billion to Softbank today if we go by the 10x valuation metric that both Nvidia and Softbank likely agreed upon back in 2020.   TL:DR: Missed NVDA run, buy ARM shares or leaps. Not investment advice!  &#x200B:";"1196";"2024-03-06T17:37:49"
"Why it's not so easy for AMD to catch up with Nvidia.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18psv7f/why_its_not_so_easy_for_amd_to_catch_up_with/";" Over the past few decades, Nvidia has been doing the same with its GPUs as Tesla has been doing with its cars: fostering a retro-compatible architecture, enabled by **software**.  Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA (a software which enables developers to seamlessly interact with Nvidia GPUs) is effectively a network which ties together all of these seemingly disparate hardware units.  Every iteration of the software accrues to an ever larger installed base, which creates an **ecosystem** that draws talent towards it. The more people that use Nvidia GPUs, the more valuable **each** GPU becomes.  Additionally, Nvidia continues to improve its software at breakneck speed. This quarter it released TensorRT-LLM, which allegedly ‚Äòwithout anybody touching anything, improves the performance \[of a GPU\] by a factor of **two**.‚Äô  During the quarter, Nvidia also announced the launch of the latest member of the Hooper family, the **H200**. It increases inference speed by a factor of **two**, with respect to the H100.  Thus, the combination of hardware and software has enabled Nvidia to increase the performance of its GPUs by a factor of **4** in a year. This would‚Äôt be possible without the software.  Additionally, Pandas (the world‚Äôs most popular data science framework) is now accelerated by Nvidia CUDA without a single line of code, thanks to the recently launched **cuDF Pandas**.  Further, in my AMD deep dive, I explain the concept of Gen 4 datacenters and how they are a requirement to bring AI to the world at scale. By becoming an indispensable part of these datacenters at the **networking** level, semiconductor companies can gain an **additional moat**.  Gen 4 are essentially **stateful**, meaning that they hold data about their state at all times and can use it to train AI models, so the datacenter gains **autonomy**.  For a datacenter to be stateful, it has to move data around the place **very efficiently**.  Nvidia‚Äôs acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 enabled it to onboard **two key technologies**:  1. **The BlueField** **DPU:** a data processing unit (DPU) is a specialized processor designed to offload networking, storage, and security tasks from general-purpose CPUs, that enables datacenters to **hold** information about themselves. 2. **Infiniband**: a high-performance networking technology that provides ultra-low latency, high bandwidth, and scalable **connectivity for data centers**. It is a key enabler for high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI), and other demanding workloads that require **fast and efficient data transfer**.  While AMD is pursuing a similar roadmap with the acquisition of Pensando, I see no particular progress made on this front.  On the other hand, Nvidia‚Äôs networking business now exceeds a $10 billion annualized revenue run rate, ‚Äòdriven by exceptional demand for InfiniBand, which grew **fivefold** year-on-year.‚Äô";"17";"2023-12-24T11:42:19"
