"Nvidia Too Expensive Now or Still Okay to Buy?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18lwsls/nvidia_too_expensive_now_or_still_okay_to_buy/";"For record, I bought some Nvidia stock about 6 years ago, looking to now add and increase my position in it. Question is do you guys think it's now too expensive after going 10x these last couple of years or would it be okay to buy, in terms of valuation? Obviously no one knows the future, but figured I'd still ask to grab some opinions.   If I remember right, when I bought Nvidia about 6 years ago, it went up around 2-3x in 1 year as well, many telling me it was too expensive, but I purchased it anyway, knowing I was still in my early 20s and had time. Today it's gone up around 10x since, but question becomes, when is too much too much?";"126";"2023-12-19T09:08:03"
"NVIDIA beat earnings, top expectations.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13qwxsw/nvidia_beat_earnings_top_expectations/";"Nvidia reported its fiscal first quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom line on the strength of its data center business. The company also said it expects Q2 revenue to come in at about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was expecting $7.2 billion.  Nvidia is at the center of the AI explosion thanks to its high-powered graphics cards and server products, and its stock price is soaring. Over the last year, shares of Nvidia have jumped 77%, while rival AMD has jumped 12%. Intel shares are down 30% in the same timeframe.  Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what was expecting, as compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue: $7.2 billion versus $6.5 billion expected  Adj. EPS: $1.09 versus $0.92 expected  Gaming: $2.2 billion versus $1.9 billion expected  Data center: $4.2 billion versus $3.9 billion expected  Shares of Nvidia were up more than 13% following the announcement.  “The computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions — accelerated computing and generative AI,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.";"1181";"2023-05-24T22:36:19"
"Nvidia is worth more than Amazon and Google. Hunting down Apple next ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b3yy0q/nvidia_is_worth_more_than_amazon_and_google/";"Make it make sense people.   It blows my mind. Amazon and Google are power houses with some of the greatest company “moats” I’ve ever seen. Nvidia is definitely dominating their market but it sure doesn’t seem they have nearly the diversified portfolio these other heavy weights do. Or the protection from another company catching up.   Google (search, cloud, mobile, YouTube, software, AI, advertising, consumer electronics, etc.) and Amazon (e-commerce, cloud, Prime, advertising, subscriptions, grocery, consumer electronics, etc)  It’s just crazy to me.

"Nvidia hits $1 trillion market cap";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13vr1zd/nvidia_hits_1_trillion_market_cap/";"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/30/nvidia-on-track-to-hit-1-trillion-market-cap-when-market-opens.html  Nvidia briefly hit a $1 trillion market cap at the open Tuesday, joining a small club of mostly technology companies. Nvidia’s shares have to hold above $404.86 to maintain that distinction throughout the day. The chipmaker’s stock rocketed last week after it posted quarterly earnings with top- and bottom-line numbers that significantly beat consensus estimates. Nvidia’s gain buoyed other chipmakers, with the notable exception of Intel, and was also fueled in part by estimates that were more optimistic than expected.  Significantly, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 alone. Expected sales were 50% higher than consensus estimates of $7.15 billion. It’s been a banner year for chipmakers, parts of the tech industry and the Nasdaq, driven in part by the AI frenzy and the possibility of slowing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Alongside Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were also buoyed in last week’s trading.  Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, are critical to generative AI platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard. The company has historically been a leader in the so-called “discrete” or standalone GPU field, but until recently, many consumers thought of GPUs as primarily used for intensive gaming. The advent of crypto mining and AI has upended that belief, and GPU manufacturers and suppliers, including Nvidia, AMD and TSMC, have seen share prices rise significantly over the last few months. By contrast, Intel, which struggled with inventory issues and development challenges, has been historically focused on the chip market for central processing units, or CPUs. The company hasn’t shared, comparatively, in the wave of investor interest.";"1427";"2023-05-30T15:56:48"

"Nvidia passes Alphabet in market cap, now the third most valuable U.S. company";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ar26eu/nvidia_passes_alphabet_in_market_cap_now_the/";"Nvidia surpassed Google parent Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday. It’s the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmaker’s stock soaring.  Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Google’s $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.  The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.  Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.  Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques — such as transformer architecture — used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.  Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a “code red” situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.  Nvidia is now the third largest U.S. company, only behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 21. Analysts expect 118% annual growth in sales to $59.04 billion.

"Nvidia announces Blackwell AI chips that will launch later this year";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bi129l/nvidia_announces_blackwell_ai_chips_that_will/";"Nvidia on Monday announced a new generation of artificial intelligence chips and software for running AI models. The announcement, made during Nvidia’s developer’s conference in San Jose, comes as the chipmaker seeks to solidify its position as the go-to supplier for AI companies.  Nvidia’s share price is up five-fold and total sales have more than tripled since OpenAI’s ChatGPT kicked off the AI boom in late 2022. Nvidia’s high-end server GPUs are essential for training and deploying large AI models. Companies like Microsoft and Meta have spent billions of dollars buying the chips.  The new generation of AI graphics processors is named Blackwell. The first Blackwell chip is called the GB200 and will ship later this year. Nvidia is enticing its customers with more powerful chips to spur new orders. Companies and software makers, for example, are still scrambling to get their hands on the current generation of H100s and similar chips.  “Hopper is fantastic, but we need bigger GPUs,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Monday at the company’s developer conference in San Jose, California. “Let me introduce you to a very big GPU.”  The company also introduced revenue-generating software called NIM that will make it easier to deploy AI, giving customers another reason to stick with Nvidia chips over a rising field of competitors.  Nvidia executives say that the company is becoming less of a mercenary chip provider and more of a platform provider, like Microsoft or Apple, on which other companies can build software.  “The sellable commercial product was the GPU and the software was all to help people use the GPU in different ways,” said Nvidia enterprise VP Manuvir Das in an interview. “Of course, we still do that. But what’s really changed is, we really have a commercial software business now.”  Das said Nvidia’s new software will make it easier to run programs on any of Nvidia’s GPUs, even older ones that might be better suited for deploying but not building AI.  “If you’re a developer, you’ve got an interesting model you want people to adopt, if you put it in a NIM, we’ll make sure that it’s runnable on all our GPUs, so you reach a lot of people,” Das said.  Every two years Nvidia updates its GPU architecture, unlocking a big jump in performance. Many of the AI models released over the past year were trained on the company’s Hopper architecture — used by chips such as the H100 — which was announced in 2022.  Nvidia says Blackwell-based processors, like the GB200, offer a huge performance upgrade for AI companies, with 20 petaflops in AI performance versus 4 petaflops for the H100. The additional processing power will enable AI companies to train bigger and more intricate models, Nvidia said.  The chip includes what Nvidia calls a “transformer engine specifically built to run transformers-based AI, one of the core technologies underpinning ChatGPT.  The Blackwell GPU is large and combines two separately manufactured dies into one chip manufactured by TSMC. It will also be available as an entire server called the GB200 NVLink 2, combining 72 Blackwell GPUs and other Nvidia parts designed to train AI models.  Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle will sell access to the GB200 through cloud services. The GB200 pairs two B200 Blackwell GPUs with one Arm-based Grace CPU. Nvidia said Amazon Web Services would build a server cluster with 20,000 GB200 chips.  Nvidia said that the system can deploy a 27-trillion-parameter model. That’s much larger than even the biggest models, such as GPT-4, which reportedly has 1.7 trillion parameters. Many artificial intelligence researchers believe bigger models with more parameters and data could unlock new capabilities.  Nvidia didn’t provide a cost for the new GB200 or the systems it’s used in. Nvidia’s Hopper-based H100 costs between $25,000 and $40,000 per chip, with whole systems that cost as much as $200,000, according to analyst estimates.  Nvidia also announced it’s adding a new product named NIM to its Nvidia enterprise software subscription.  NIM makes it easier to use older Nvidia GPUs for inference, or the process of running AI software, and will allow companies to continue to use the hundreds of millions of Nvidia GPUs they already own. Inference requires less computational power than the initial training of a new AI model. NIM enables companies that want to run their own AI models, instead of buying access to AI results as a service from companies like OpenAI.  The strategy is to get customers who buy Nvidia-based servers to sign up for Nvidia enterprise, which costs $4,500 per GPU per year for a license.  Nvidia will work with AI companies like Microsoft or Hugging Face to ensure their AI models are tuned to run on all compatible Nvidia chips. Then, using a NIM, developers can efficiently run the model on their own servers or cloud-based Nvidia servers without a lengthy configuration process.  “In my code, where I was calling into OpenAI, I will replace one line of code to point it to this NIM that I got from Nvidia instead,” Das said.  Nvidia says the software will also help AI run on GPU-equipped laptops, instead of on servers in the cloud.

"Cathie Wood calls Nvidia stock 'overpriced' after missing 2023 rally";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13wi9do/cathie_wood_calls_nvidia_stock_overpriced_after/";"Cathie Wood isn't buying the artificial intelligence hype at Nvidia (NVDA).      The founder of Ark Invest, and noted tech innovation investor, tweeted on Monday that the AI darling is now overpriced.     Nvidia shares have risen more than 30% since the company reported earnings on May 24, and the stock touched a $1 trillion dollar market cap on Tuesday.         Wood and Ark sold their holdings in Nvidia back in January. Since Nvidia's stock has more than doubled as investors have dubbed the company the clear leader in the AI chipmaking arms race. In just the past week, Nvidia announced revenue guidance that blew away Wall Street estimates and followed that news up with new AI-focused product launches.   It hasn't just been Nvidia stock soaring, either. On Friday, Marvell Technology (MRVL) said the company expects revenue attributable to AI to double the next year. Shares rose more than 30% on the news amid a broader AI-infused tech rally that's continued into Monday's trading session.   With the Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) now up more than 2.5% in the last five days, Wood argues there are going to be other winners in the AI space outside of Nvidia.   ""Other companies with visionary leaders, strong global distribution and, perhaps most important, large-high-quality pools of proprietary data should be big #AI winners, with revenues and earnings surprising significantly on the high side of expectations during the years ahead,"" Wood tweeted.   There will be ""dozens"" of AI winners, according to Wood. But the one that stands out to Ark, as it often does, is Tesla (TSLA).   Wood argues that at six times revenue, Tesla stock is far cheaper than Nvidia's current 25 times revenue valuation.   ""(Tesla) is the most obvious beneficiary of the recent breakthroughs in #AI, as it aims for an $8-10 trillion revenue TAM in autonomous mobility by 2030,"" Wood wrote.   With several positive headlines in the news of late including a growing relationship in China, Tesla shares are up more than 7% amid the broader tech rally.     Wood's Nvidia comments come as her flagship ETF, the Ark Innovation Fund (ARKK), has struggled to return to its pandemic dominance. The ETF skyrocketed during the risk-on bull market of 2020 with high-flying pandemic darlings like Tesla, Zoom (ZM), and even Nvidia contributing to gains.   But as the Federal Reserve enacted its most aggressive interest rate hike campaign in four decades, risky bets became less popular with investors. Some of Ark's top holdings, such as Zoom, Roku (ROKU), and Coinbase (COIN) are well off their pandemic highs.   The fund itself lost more than $1 billion in market cap in 2022 with shares falling nearly 67%.";"914";"2023-05-31T12:22:50"

Zuckerberg also said he excited about Meta’s progress incorporating AI technology in other type of devices like its Ray Ban smart glasses.  Start-ups and enterprise have clamored for Nvidia ’s GPUs, or graphics processing units because they are well suited for the parallel computations needed for AI projects.  A Meta spokesperson declined to provide clarity on the timing of H100 purchases and on whether the other H100 equivalent GPUs consisted of other Nvidia GPU models or were from different third parties.  Nvidia declined to comment on the timing of Meta’s H100 purchases.  The H100 is Nvidia’s current top-of-line data center GPU and costs roughly $25,000 per GPU, according to a slide in an earlier company presentation that showed a 16 H100 GPU system costs $400,000.  Though, it is unknown at what price Meta can purchase the H100, a quantity of 350,000 at $25,000 per GPU comes to nearly $9 billion.

"Shouldn't the Nvidia stock be skyrocketing?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1734880/shouldnt_the_nvidia_stock_be_skyrocketing/";"Gamer here, live in a basement, play games 24/7, don't have money, don't own stocks.  But I do know what the stock market is.  So here is my question: *why on earth isn't the Nvidia stock going up and up until there is quite literally not enough money in any investor's pocket anymore to buy another share?*  Do the people with money not understand what's going on? Nvidia has 0 competition and every single one of the richest people on earth is buying as many GPUs as they can, probably paying double/triple to get their hardware delivered first. This is happening right now as we speak.  Sooooooo ... uhm ... do only people that game 24/7 actually get what the AI revolution entails? Isn't it obvious? Are nerds with 10+ years of ""experience"" in their field the only people that can actually tell what's happening? Like do I have to be a hobby pilot for 10 years to see when a revolutionary invention is happening in the aerospace industry? Is everyone else blind to that? I'm confused. Do people always think they are being tricked when it comes to stocks? You could have had a nerdy friend working in machine learning and he could have told you everything that's going down now back in 2019.  If I understand this correctly, then the only reason Nvidia stock isn't rising every week is because people think they are being tricked by nerdy gamers?  &#x200B:  UPDATE: Alright, thanks everyone for sharing your thoughts! Really appreciate it. To wrap up, here's a summary of the reasons why Nvidia stock isn't continually rising:  * People only trust their own eyes. Which I think is fair. I could sit here forever explaining how the AI revolution will play out and people would still wait until they can actually feel the impact themselves. For example, in the next 4 weeks, ChatGPT will roll out an image creator. A large amount of normies will absolutely love that feature. Normie subs to ChatGPT -> normie loves it -> normie understands Nvidia hardware is driving it -> normie invests -> stock rises. That's the only way it happens. No reddit post can compete with that. * Supply. Nvidia just can not keep up with the orders. The demand is wayyy higher than the supply. And this isn't changing anytime soon. Takes forever to build these factories. * Ursula got wind of the numbers Nvidia is crankin' out and is preparing a 4 billion fine for being smarter than the competition. * Geopolitical uncertainties.   &#x200B:";"0";"2023-10-08T19:04:42"

They cited the ongoing AI boom as a key driver, expecting strong AI server momentum to surpass projections and continue outpacing supply. This trend is anticipated to persist through 2025, benefiting from a clearer understanding of US Cloud Service Providers' capital expenditures.      The bullish outlook aligns with Nvidia's impressive 2023 growth, with its shares surging over 200% year-to-date. The success of AI solutions like ChatGPT has stimulated this growth and propelled Nvidia into the ranks of trillion-dollar companies, alongside Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia's upcoming fiscal Q2 2024 earnings report is highly anticipated after the company's optimistic guidance of $11 billion in revenue, a substantial leap from Wall Street's $7.15 billion estimate.

I don't know when the company last sold shares, but I doubt it was at a price higher than it is now. I thought buybacks were done when an issuer thought their stock was undervalued and could purchase it for less than originally sold.  They could instead pay off all their outstanding notes, but considering the low rates on them, they could earn a risk free net return elsewhere.  Doubling their dividend could be an attractive option. They have been paying only .04 a quarter when they use to pay .16.  Companies lately have been choosing stock buyback plans rather than paying dividends or increasing them. While this can lead to a higher share price, it doesn't exactly return profits to investors like a dividend does.   Deciding what to do with excess cash is a difficult decision. Reinvestment helps a company grow. Paying dividends adds value. I just don't really see the benefit of buybacks unless there aren't any better opportunities. Not at these prices anyway.

"Cathie Wood's ARK Invest sold most of its Nvidia stake just before the chipmaker kicked off a rally that added $585 billion in market value";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13rxgz6/cathie_woods_ark_invest_sold_most_of_its_nvidia/";"Cathie Wood's Ark Invest is probably wishing it didn't sell nearly 1 million shares of Nvidia between early October and today following the chipmaker's massive year-to-date surge of more than 160%.  Nvidia stock soared as much as 30% on Thursday after the company announced jaw-dropping guidance as it benefits from a wave of demand for its chipsets that support generative AI technology platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Bard.  But the active investment manager, who has owned Nvidia on and off since the flagship fund's inception in 2014, missed out on massive gains as it started to pare down its position in Nvidia heading into a 52-week low in mid-October.  Since Ark Invest's first sale on October 5, when it held 1.3 million shares of Nvidia across all of its ETFs, the stock has soared 190% and added $620 billion to its market value. By late November, Nvidia owned just over 500,000 shares of the company.  Today, Ark Invest holds just 390,000 shares across its suite of next-generation technology ETFs. The stock is not in its flagship Disruptive Innovation fund.  Rough calculations by Insider suggest Ark Invest left more than $200 million in potential profits on the table when it sold down its Nvidia stake throughout the end of last year.   Ark's ill-timed share sale of Nvidia highlights the difficulties of actively managing a portfolio of disruption-focused investments, because even if you pick the right theme to invest in, there's no guarantee you'll pick the right companies to bet on.  **In February, Wood said Ark's wave of Nvidia sales was in part because its valuation was ""very high"" and that it was consolidating its portfolio into higher conviction names.**  ""We like Nvidia, we think it's going to be a good stock. It's priced, it's the 'check-the-box' AI company. For a flagship fund, where we're consolidated towards our highest conviction names, part of that has to do with the valuation,"" she told CNBC on February 27.  Wood is instead counting on UiPath for Ark Invest's exposure to artificial intelligence, which is its second largest position across all of its ETFs. Meanwhile, Tesla remains Ark Invest's top holding, which is also working on artificial intelligence to help enable its self-driving technology.   But despite the hype in AI this year, those two stocks have only captured some of the year-to-date gains seen across the space. Shares of UIPath are up just 14% year-to-date, while Tesla stock is up an impressive 50%.   Shares of Ark Invest's Disruptive Innovation ETF were down 2.7% on Thursday, despite the Nasdaq 100 jumping 1.7%.   https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/cathie-wood-ark-invest-sold-nvidia-stake-before-ai-rally-2023-5?";"2358";"2023-05-26T01:55:45"

"Why should anyone buy Nvidia when they can buy TSMC/Samsung/Intel and get the same AI upside with less risk?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ax9c2t/why_should_anyone_buy_nvidia_when_they_can_buy/";"Nvidia, because of explosive demand for AI, is trading at over 100 times earnings. It is priced on the assumption of a distant future where there is a continued and growing demand for AI products, and where they face little competition.  The thing is, Nvidia's high gross margins are public knowledge. And they cannot produce enough chips. This gives fabs such as TSMC, Samsung, and possibly even Intel insane pricing power.  On top of all this, if a competitor happens to provide a viable alternative to Nvidia, it could put significant pressure on Nvidia's margins and market share, but the fabs could continue to charge high prices per wafer.  TSMC is trading at a P/E of 25 and Samsung 35, which is high, but not too high for a growing company.  There's a saying, ""During a gold rush, sell shovels"". A lot of people may say that Nvidia's AI chips are the shovels, but I'd argue the analogy leans more towards fabs like TSMC. A shovel still has some use after a gold rush ends, an AI chip has little use after an AI rush ends. But a fab always has chips to produce, whether they're AI chips, or other purposes.";"321";"2024-02-22T16:38:07"

J&J’s MedTech unit and Nvidia plan to integrate AI within devices and platforms from pre-op to post-op to help ensure that surgeons have access to all the information they need, Nvidia’s vice president of health care Kimberly Powell said. For instance, the companies are using AI to analyze surgical video and automate the time-consuming documentation required after a procedure.   “There’s an ability to use all the sources of data inside an operating room, whether it’s your voice, or whether it’s the video coming from a camera inside the body, or elsewhere, to take advantage of the generative AI moment that we’re in,” Powell told CNBC in an interview.   The MedTech unit at J&J creates tools and solutions for conditions such as heart failure, kidney disease and stroke, and its technology is used in more than 75 million procedures each year, the company told CNBC. Powell said Nvidia has worked in medical devices and imaging for more than a decade.   Shan Jegatheeswaran, vice president and global head of digital at J&J MedTech, said just one minute of surgical video is equivalent to roughly 25 CT scans, so having the compute power and infrastructure to annotate and share those videos widely will be powerful for surgeons.  In the short term, he said de-identifying and enhancing the video can help educate and train surgeons. In the long term, analytics can be layered on top of video to provide real-time decision support. More accessible surgical video means residents will not have to solely depend on the insight and availability of the more experienced physicians at their institutions.   “Think about athletes. They look at game tape, and they get better over time as they look at themselves,” Jegatheeswaran told CNBC in an interview. “That’s sort of the starting point. That’s the holy grail in the short term.”  Powell said the collaboration is in the “early innings,” and many applications will take time to fine-tune and implement safely. However, she said nondiagnostic use cases such as automating paperwork will help save surgeons time and make a difference “right out of the gate.”  “I think all of us as patients should get really excited about the fact that this kind of technology is going to be able to enter in and be within reach of all the clinicians and all the hardworking nurses and all the health-care staff,” Powell said. “They’re going to have the very best tools and information at their disposal.”  Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/18/nvidia-and-johnson-johnson-to-build-ai-applications-for-surgery-.html";"423";"2024-03-18T23:34:42"

It's not just you, and it's called Hindsight Bias.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13xwknm/psa_do_you_beat_yourself_up_after_missing_obvious/";"Before I knew about this psychological bias, I (and many others I know) thought we just had trouble 'biting the bullet' and investing in solid ideas. Thoughts like ""it was in front of me all along, but for some reason, I was too scared to put money into it"" were common. But the fact of the matter is, there are thousands of 'ideas' at any given moment, and the ones that actually make the news and become multi-baggers were **not** obvious in the past. So why do people feel this way, that they keep 'missing' out on obviously great investments? This is what is known as Hindsight Bias.   Hindsight bias is, [according to Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hindsight-bias.asp), ""a psychological phenomenon that allows people to convince themselves after an event that they accurately predicted it before it happened. This can lead people to conclude that they can accurately predict other events. Hindsight bias is studied in behavioral economics because it is a common failing of individual investors.""  Why is knowing about hindsight bias significant? One, because if you believe that you **did** have proper insight and analytical skills to spot future success stories, then you might chase after any idea that looks good to to you **now**. However, unless you actually have proof that you were able to consistency find good ideas in that past that you simply didn't capitalize on, then you should not trust just your memory. Otherwise, one would pick potentially bad investments, and then **think** that they knew about other better ideas, repeating the cycle.   It's also important to recognize this bias just for your state of mind. Enough people feel bad enough about missing multi-baggers like Amazon when they should be giving themselves a break. Saying you could have made made 100k if you only invested in some stock years ago is not the same as losing 100k, or we'd all be in the hole. So don't fret about the past and keep looking to the future. There are still plenty of opportunities out there, so best of luck investing!   **Tldr:** Whatever happened in the past was not obvious, no matter how much it feels like it. Don't be overconfident that you can catch future ones but don't beat yourself up over missing opportunities either. Focus on the future!";"929";"2023-06-02T01:17:42"

"Ultimate Nvidia DD (The Best)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1asfjmv/ultimate_nvidia_dd_the_best/";"First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens.      It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark.   No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space.      First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently?      You could say it’s because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood.   It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT.      AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks.      How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype?   Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it’s not just any Product. It’s a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.   An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand.      This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).      This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW.      They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party.      How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else.      Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts:      \- Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees      \- Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to)      \- Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development)      \- Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers      The Analogy:      „Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood).      TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees.      The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.      At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture.      Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.      Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market.      What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process.      Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“      \----      NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips.      Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that’s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn’t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture.      NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them.      Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC.   TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple.      So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them.      There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.      So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel.   Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD?   This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design.      Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough.      AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips.      Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again.      According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.      Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?!      Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so:      „However, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration.

"Nvidia and The Coming Darkness";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13ryqc8/nvidia_and_the_coming_darkness/";"Nvidia and The Coming Darkness        In a more serious sector of the market, we have $NVDA making a historic move to a new ATH ($380) on the speculation of transformative AI breakthroughs. Recession fears lying dead in the trunk of the starship rocket. With the price of used GPU’s sliding to the downside since early 2022, it’s hard to understand where the priced in demand will come into fruition.    Last quarter, Nvidia’s profit surged 26% to $2 billion, and sales rose 19% to $7.2 billion, each easily surpassing Wall Street analysts’ forecasts. Nvidia’s outlook for the current quarter was also significantly — about 50% — higher than analysts’ predictions.   The pump is based on forward earnings estimates along side the speculation on new AI tech. Let’s break down these two individually and see if this historic move is justified.   Let’s begin with Generative AI as this is the premise for massive forward anticipated demand. So powerful and transformative it will transcend and eclipse the likely incoming recession.   Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. The recent buzz around generative AI has been driven by the simplicity of new user interfaces for creating high-quality text, graphics and videos in a matter of seconds.       Going forward, this technology could help write code, design new drugs, develop products, redesign business processes and transform supply chains.   What are use cases for generative AI?   •	Implementing chatbots for customer service and technical support.   •	Deploying deepfakes for mimicking people or even specific individuals.   •	Improving dubbing for movies and educational content in different languages.   •	Writing email responses, dating profiles, resumes and term papers.   •	Creating photorealistic art in a particular style.   •	Improving product demonstration videos.   •	Suggesting new drug compounds to test.   •	Designing physical products and buildings.   •	Optimizing new chip designs.   •	Writing music in a specific style or tone.      These seem like great conveniences for the modern world. Transformative recession resistant groundbreaking technology? Not so much. AMD has shared a small fraction of the liquidity wave incoming for AI tech. They over expanded their business ventures in late 2021 as we slid into a major market pullback based on inflation fears and fed tightening. Is this a leading indicator of what’s to come for NVIDIA’s aggressive expansion moving into a recession yet to be priced in? Maybe.    NVIDIA has the technicals, financials and narrative on its side. All of which can change on a dime. What really matters are valuations which are flashing red in an alarming way.   The new all-time high price wasn’t the only new ATH for NVIDIA.   Let’s look at some indicators for NVIDIA.      Price to earnings P/E (TTM)   •	NEW ATH – 218x (2023)   •	OLD ATH – 97x (2017)     We’ve seen a significant rise in the P/E ratio in a very short period, which indicates a large amount of speculation on NVIDIA.      Price to Sales P/S (TTM)   •	NEW ATH – 34.8x (2023)   •	OLD ATH – 26.2x (2021)      P/S at 34.8x is extremely high, it’s also important to note that we’re at higher levels currently than we were at peak mania back in both 2021 & 2017. You will be dead before earnings catch up with current valuations, your children would also likely expire prior to these valuations making sense. We could call this a multi-generational investment strategy at best. Jokes aside, it’s more likely than not that we will see a massive correction in NVIDIA stock price. Insider sell volume continues to grow over the last 3 quarters and is likely to continue throughout 2023 and into 2024.   Nvidia is not a small startup. Its sales amounted to $27bn over the past year, while its free cash flow came in at $3.8bn, reflecting a free cash flow margin of 14%, which is higher than the NDX average of 12%. Such extreme valuation ratios are rare for large established companies as growth is a declining function of market size.     The combination of speculative trading activity, particularly in options markets, and the allure of a new game-changing technology often come together to create spikes in stock prices that are far out of line with any fundamental developments. As a stock's price rises, its gain attracts attention and strengthens the credibility of the underlying bullish story, which creates further buying interest. When a high volume of option trading takes place as in the case of Nvidia currently, this adds fuel to the fire as relatively small amounts of individual capital can have an outsized impact on prices.   We often see investors abandon traditional valuation methods or ignore valuations altogether when a fashionable stock such as Nvidia rallies significantly beyond its earnings potential. Many recent articles on Nvidia do a good job of explaining why the company will grow strongly yet ignore the issue of valuation.     As much as I enjoy my NVIDIA GPU, AMD has bridged the gap in performance at a cheaper price. NVIDIA are well known for being overpriced in the gaming industry. Future growth at this valuation almost completely relies on AI rapidly improving to another level again from here. This is screaming sell the news IMO. Given everything we’ve gone over and the coming recession, NVIDIA cannot possibly keep up with their projections in the most recent report. If you don’t believe the recession is coming, just remember a 3-month and 10-year inversion has never been wrong.   It is very easy to see the flaws investing in something like $PEPE or $GME. NVIDIA on the other hand is a good company and does a great job of projecting believable future growth.      Beware the Phantom.";"57";"2023-05-26T02:52:37"

"Nvidia- Don't Mistake a Highly Cyclical stock for Perpetual Growth. Perspective from a Software Engineer, why I set a $250 price target.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1axj4og/nvidia_dont_mistake_a_highly_cyclical_stock_for/";"Nvidia is currently trading at over 100x earnings, but many investors will justify this by claiming that ""forward earnings"" is 25x. ""Forward earnings"" is just an estimate from analysts where they took past growth, and extrapolated it out into the future.   These analysts do not understand the industry. They ignored AI for several years while CUDA was regularly being used in AI research and AI projects, setting price targets and earning estimates too low, and it only caught their attention as a growth engine when AI models started producing impressive media, rather than just boring scientific papers. Now, having seen earnings, they are assuming this growth will continue perpetually, without considering how the industry works.  Nvidia's growth in earnings is due to the surge in companies looking to fund AI projects. As a hot new trend, Even non-tech companies are trying to explore ways they can utilize AI, even in areas where it makes no sense and doesn't add any value. AI has essentially became a buzzword in the way that Blockchain was a few years ago, or ""internet"" was 25 years ago. Historically, these trends often last a couple years before slowing down considerably.  Since AI chips are a brand new market, companies are essentially building up AI infrastructure from nothing. And Nvidia is the only real supplier. Unlike other capital goods, there is no used/secondhand market yet. So in the short term, this has understandably meant exploding earnings as Nvidia can charge outrageous prices and faces no competition.  But will it last? It probably will in the short term, Nvidia can't ship enough chips yet to meet demand, and competitors will take time to produce viable alternatives, so there is probably a sales backlog that can keep them going a few quarters, possibly another year or two. But eventually supply will catch up to demand, and when that happens, growth will stagnate.  On top of this, a couple years down the line most companies will abandon their AI projects that don't work out.  When they do, you now have all of this used AI hardware(or cloud capacity) that is now on the market. Other companies can then buy this hardware at a discount, or cloud services now have less of a need to expand their AI compute capacity. This is exactly what happened with the crypto mining boom- Nvidia made a huge windfall from crypto mining sales, but then the market dried up, a huge oversupply hit the secondary market, and Nvidia's earnings stagnated until AI came to the rescue.  Now of course, you could argue that Nvidia will release better hardware every 2 years, and that will ensure they still have a market. And I think they will.   But this introduces our next problem- suppliers. Nvidia is dependent on TSMC to produce their AI chips.  They could potentially use Samsung or Intel as well. They do not own their own fab.  Fortunately for them, they already had a lot of capacity they reserved with TSMC for their RTX 4000 GPUs, which they switched to produce AI chips, which has allowed them to produce a lot of AI chips for dirt cheap, and enjoy huge margins. But when Nvidia's contract with them runs out, they're at risk. Nvidia's 75% gross margin is well known. Additionally, it's almost certain that other companies like AMD are planning their own AI products. This explosion in manufacturing demand, combined with knowledge of Nvidia's high margins, will give TSMC leverage to raise their prices, threatening Nvidia's margins.  Our next issue is competitors. Nvidia may control nearly the entire  AI hardware market now, but is extremely unlikely to remain that way. AMD GPUs are just as capable of creating and running AI models as Nvidia, the main problem is most software is built for CUDA, which runs on Nvidia hardware.    With the huge surge in the AI market, it's almost certain that there are companies out there developing AI models that can run on AMD, and it's very likely AMD is designing their own dedicated AI chips and software around it. There is tremendous amounts of money to be made in producing either cheaper hardware, or software that can run on cheaper hardware. If you look on LinkedIn, job boards, etc, you'll see semiconductor companies have hired and hiring large amounts of ML/AI engineers. And these listings don't mention CUDA. Assuming that Nvidia will never face any competition is naïve. Nvidia will probably remain a leader since they are ahead, but cheaper alternatives will threaten their pricing power.  Overall, the semiconductor industry is often a boom/bust industry, and I expect it will stay that way, even with AI. Investors should be careful buying during a boom period based on the assumption that it will continue booming.  All of this leads us to the valuation. Nvidia's quarterly earnings are likely to remain around $5 per share over the next few quarters, or possibly even grow a bit further, as demand remains high. But as competitors enter the market, a secondhand market emerges from failed startups, suppliers raise prices, and investor funding for AI startups dries up, I expect these earnings to decline over the next decade, until stabilizing when the industry matures  I ultimately decided on the following:  $25 earnings FY2025(a bit optimistic, that's assuming significant growth this year, more than analysts are predicting)  (5%) negative growth in earnings for a decade followed by 2% terminal growth rate as the industry matures and the race to the bottom ends.  8% discount rate  = $249.89 fair value per share";"1";"2024-02-22T23:01:55"

"How Competitive will AMD be against Nvidia in AI Accelerator Market";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16munt4/how_competitive_will_amd_be_against_nvidia_in_ai/";"I've been delving into the specifics of AMD's New MI 300 platform and it appears to stack up favorably against the H100, often surpassing it in several aspects. However, there's an ongoing discussion about ROCm lagging behind CUDA, though AMD is vigorously working to bridge this software gap. Despite not being a semiconductor novice, I find myself drawn to AMD's chiplet-based design over Nvidia's monolithic approach. As we move toward smaller die sizes with High NA EUV, expertise in chiplet-based design will prove crucial, yielding numerous advantages. Additionally, AMD's ability to integrate different process nodes within the same package adds to cost efficiency.      This discussion is pertinent due to the striking disparity in revenue estimates between AMD and Nvidia. The projections suggest Nvidia might achieve over six times the Accelerator revenue in 2027. It's worth noting that the actual figure could be even higher, considering that Data Center revenue encompasses enterprise CPU sales as well.

"Breaking: Nvidia’s Market Volatility Exposed as Graphics Card Price Drops Signal Intense Competition in Semiconductor Industry.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14vs10r/breaking_nvidias_market_volatility_exposed_as/";"Graphics card prices in the semiconductor industry have been on the decline for almost a year, and Nvidia, one of the leading players in the semiconductor industry, has felt the impact. The company’s RTX 4060 and RTX 4080 models have experienced price drops. This development serves as a reminder that even industry giants like Nvidia face intense competition in the semiconductor market, making investments in the company potentially volatile.  Today Forbes reported a significant decrease in the prices of Nvidia’s RTX 4060, with the card dropping by as much as six percent within just a week of its launch.   Include the tepid reception from reviewers, and this isn’t a good start for Nvidia’s latest launch. This has resulted in customers gravitating towards older graphics cards from both AMD and Nvidia themselves, particularly those not heavily reliant on ray tracing or DLSS technologies.  The situation becomes more apparent with the RTX 4080, as the graphics card’s experienced a price drop in Europe, and a 17 percent reduction in the US market from $1,199 to $999 was the most significant change.   These price drops and market dynamics highlight the highly competitive nature of the semiconductor industry. Nvidia’s position as a dominant player does not shield it from the pressures of a rapidly evolving market. The recent pricing pressure also suggests potential challenges in terms of demand and competition, which may impact the company’s financial performance and stock value.  Investing in Nvidia should be approached with caution, considering the inherent volatility in the semiconductor industry. While Nvidia has demonstrated its ability to adapt and innovate in the past, the market landscape is constantly shifting. The recent price drops serve as a stark reminder that even established players must navigate fierce competition and changing consumer preferences.  It is crucial to keep a watchful eye on Nvidia’s future product releases, market trends, and financial performance. These factors will shape the company’s ability to maintain its competitive edge and provide a clearer picture of the investment potential in the semiconductor industry.  In conclusion, Nvidia’s recent experience with pricing pressure highlights the competitiveness and volatility of the semiconductor market. As the company continues to navigate these challenges, investors should carefully assess the risks and potential rewards associated with investing in this industry heavyweight.";"152";"2023-07-10T14:00:04"
"Nvidia Stock Faces Decline In Coming Years As AI Chip Demand Softens, Warns Analyst: 'We're Looking At The Horizon'";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ctj169/nvidia_stock_faces_decline_in_coming_years_as_ai/";"The future of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock might not be as promising as its recent performance suggests, according to a prominent analyst.  What Happened: DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria has cautioned that Nvidia’s stock might not be able to sustain its meteoric rise due to a potential decline in demand for its GPUs, according to an interview on BNN Bloomberg.  Luria predicts that Nvidia’s profits for the last quarter will exceed $25 billion. However, he foresees a long-term decline for the chipmaker as it faces increasing competition, even from its own major customers.  “The reason we’re not quite as bullish as everybody else is we’re looking at the horizon. What’s going to happen next year? What’s going to happen in 2026? We think there’s accumulating more and more evidence this can’t continue,” Luria said. “Whenever one company extracts this much profit out of the market, competition does come in, and in Nvidia’s case, it’s coming in from its customers.   He noted that the majority of Nvidia’s business comes from its five largest customers, including Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Tesla, all of which are also major players in the AI sector. These firms are reportedly developing their own AI chips, posing a potential threat to Nvidia’s future.   Luria also pointed out that despite some customers stockpiling Nvidia’s GPUs, demand is likely to taper off eventually, leading to a decline in revenue. This could catch investors off guard, potentially resulting in a significant drop in the stock price.  Why It Matters: The warning from Luria comes at a time when Nvidia’s stock has been the subject of much discussion. The company’s stock has been on a remarkable rise, with a 240% surge in 2023 and an additional 80% increase in 2024.  This has led to a debate among investors on whether to buy now or wait for a potential drop in the stock price. The recent performance of Nvidia’s stock has sparked a debate among fund managers. Some, like Trent Masters, a portfolio manager at Alphinity Investment Management, suggest that the stock is still a good buy despite its significant rise. He points to the chipmaker’s strong market share and sustainable earnings as reasons for his bullish stance.  On the other hand, Luria’s warning is not the only one to have been issued recently. Chinese regulators have reportedly instructed local tech firms, including TikTok parent ByteDance, Tencent Holding Ltd, Alibaba Group Holding Limited, and Baidu Inc, to reduce their consumption of Nvidia’s AI chips and invest in more domestically made AI chips instead. This could potentially impact Nvidia’s future business in China.   However, not all analysts share Luria’s caution. HSBC Global Research recently maintained Nvidia with a Buy rating and lifted its 12-month price target, suggesting that the chipmaker’s strong pricing power will allow it to continue delivering upside surprises through fiscal-year 2026.  Despite the warnings, some analysts remain optimistic about Nvidia’s future. KeyBanc analyst John Vinh maintained an Overweight rating on Nvidia and a price target of $1,200, expecting Nvidia to report fiscal first-quarter results and second-quarter guidance meaningfully above expectations.";"0";"2024-05-16T19:51:53"

KeyBanc analyst John Vinh upped his price target on shares of Nvidia NVDA, -0.76% to $550 from $500 late Monday, with his new target among the highest on Wall Street: Above Vinh’s $550 target were one $767 target price and two $600 target prices, according to FactSet. C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI matched Vinh at $550.  Shares closed Monday at $421.80, and they’re up 189% so far this year.  Vinh’s heightened optimism about Nvidia’s prospects comes after he conducted channel checks in Asia. Those indicated strong interest in AI servers that are “not only coming from cloud but also enterprise and from AI startups,” he wrote in a note to clients.  Additionally, he said he sees the potential for Nvidia to benefit from delays related to an Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, +0.36% product.  “Delays associated with AMD’s MI300 are likely to free up incremental capacity in 2H23, while we believe NVDA has secured enough capacity (CoWoS) to quadruple its datacenter revenues in 2024,” Vinh wrote, referring to chip-on-wafer-on-substrate, a type of packaging.   That said, Vinh also boosted his price target on shares of AMD, despite more “mixed” channel checks there, compared with the “positive” ones for Nvidia.  “While near-term challenges associated with delays of its MI300 AI server and stability issues with its PC NB Ryzen Phoenix (7040) could result in near-term risk to estimates, AI server wins at HP/El Capitan, MSFT, and Meta give us high conviction that AMD could see well over $2B in AI revenues in 2024,” Vinh wrote, as he lifted his price target on the shares to $160 from $150.  Chip companies will begin reporting earnings in the coming weeks, and one trend to watch will be how server demand is playing out more broadly. “AI servers [are] seeing outsized demand but appear to be cannibalizing traditional server,” Vihn wrote in his note to clients.  He also flagged overall weakness in China, “with no signs of a recovery, which is limiting the inventory destocking process.”    https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidias-stock-could-fly-to-550-amid-robust-demand-across-the-board-in-ai-analyst-says-e157f522";"18";"2023-07-11T14:46:44"
"Apple, Nvidia, Intel, and Others Interested in Arm’s Upcoming Blockbuster IPO";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15lihiv/apple_nvidia_intel_and_others_interested_in_arms/";"[https://tokenist.com/apple-nvidia-intel-and-others-interested-in-arms-upcoming-blockbuster-ipo/](https://tokenist.com/apple-nvidia-intel-and-others-interested-in-arms-upcoming-blockbuster-ipo/)  September initial public offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq, after receiving approvals from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Nasdaq. The anticipated $60 billion valuation will make it the largest IPO of 2023. Leading tech giants such as Nvidia, Intel, Samsung, and Apple are keen to acquire a few percent stake each in Arm, aiming for medium to long-term shareholder roles to ensure stock price stability at listing.      Since the abandonment of a $40 billion sale to Nvidia in 2020 due to regulatory concerns, SoftBank has been working on taking Arm public. The chipmaker's market valuation has doubled from the $31 billion SoftBank paid seven years ago. This significant IPO follows Technicolor's $97 billion deal in September 2022, marking a major milestone in the technology and finance sectors.      Arm's IPO stands as a pivotal event in the global semiconductor market, reflecting the company's critical role in the industry. Along with the imminent listing, other major financial moves are underway in the tech world, such as Alibaba's contemplation of a $29 billion listing of its IDCG e-commerce unit in the US, showcasing a dynamic and robust market landscape.";"35";"2023-08-08T15:37:44"
"NVIDIA's Impressive Report: Not the Market's Silver Bullet";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13rjtn7/nvidias_impressive_report_not_the_markets_silver/";"What's driving today's markets?  As anticipated, Wall Street's opening was a mixed bag, echoing the fluctuating futures. Shares in the real sector and banks are down, whereas technology and semiconductor manufacturers' stocks are enjoying a healthy boost. The primary catalyst for this tech growth was Nvidia's earnings report, released after yesterday's market close.  What's happening with NVIDIA?  Despite a decline in revenue and net profit by 13% and 20% respectively, the reported figures significantly outpaced analysts' predictions. Furthermore, the company announced impressive sales for Q2 2023 that surprised even the most bullish investors. Pre-market NVIDIA shares surged by 24%, and since the opening bell, the growth has topped 25%. A little more momentum, and Nvidia will join the $1 trillion club.  In my view, this is a fascinating story that highlights the 135% increase in NVIDIA's share price over the past year, which ha largely been attributed to the booming popularity of AI.  However, **I believe this growth alone won't suffice to propel the market further**. Given the challenging economic conditions, I see a high probability of a market correction on the horizon.  Let's also consider some statistical data. U.S. GDP figures surpassed expectations, yet with the unresolved debt ceiling issue, this news has taken a back seat and will likely resonate later. And as for the initial U.S. jobless claims? No change there either, meaning there’s yet more to keep an eye on in the future.  What raises concern is that the **DXY is standing at 104.21 points**, and the **ten-year UST yield is at 3.77% per annum**, with **the two-year yield at an alarming 4.42%**! Meanwhile, **gold is trending downwards**. All in all, quite an intriguing scenario.";"11";"2023-05-25T16:50:50"

If for example TSMC's Arizona facilities are completed in 2027, somehow allowing 10x orders to go to NVidia, NVidia will increase substantially if they're paid upon shipment. If they're paid months, and in some cases a year in advance, their increase may be limited if they're already being paid for chips that aren't yet finished and ready to assemble. I'm just curious if Nvidia has ever explained if they essentially request payment on delivery, or upon the time of agreement of purchase.   Thanks in advance.";"10";"2024-01-24T18:27:32"

Here’s how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December:      Earnings per share: 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected   Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.15 billion expected     For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue.      Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 billion, or 16 cents per share, last year.      With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue.      Intel shares are up over 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia and AMD on Wall Street.      Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia’s recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs.      Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips.      Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye into an independent company in 2022.      Intel’s largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips. The overall PC industry has been in a slump for two years, but recently started showing signs of growth again. Intel reported $8.8 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 33%.      Intel’s second largest division, Data Center and AI, saw sales decline 10% to $4 billion. That unit includes server CPUs and GPUs.      Intel foundry services, its business making chips for other companies, remains nascent, with $291 million in revenue, a 63% annual increase.";"461";"2024-01-25T22:17:40"

Other politicians followed suit, buying up oil and defense stocks before the Ukraine invasion.  In July, Nancy and Paul Pelosi sold all their Nvidia stock. By August, Nvidia was instructed by the US to limit chip sales in China and Russia, causing the stock to drop 20%. When questioned about the timing of her sale, Pelosi remained silent.  Senator Thomas Carper bought bearish ETFs before significant rate hikes and CPI data from the federal reserve. Interestingly, he sits on the Senate Finance Committee, and his positions have profited.  Congress members also heavily invested in semiconductors prior to the passing of the CHIPS bill and restrictions in China. This led to significant gains for them in 2023.

Here are the key numbers:  Total deliveries Q1 2024: 386,810 Total production Q1 2024: 433,371  Tesla doesn’t break out sales of its vehicles by model but reported that it produced 412,376 Model 3/Y cars and delivered 369,783 of those cars. It produced 20,995 of its other models and delivered 17,027.  In the same period last year, the electric automaker reported 422,875 deliveries and production of 440,808 vehicles. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla reported 484,507 deliveries and production of 494,989 vehicles.  Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company’s shareholder communications.  According to a mean of 11 estimates compiled by FactSet, analysts were expecting deliveries of around 457,000 for the period ending March 31. Estimates ranged from a high of 511,000 deliveries to a low of 414,000 for the first quarter, with estimates updated in March ranging from 414,000 to 469,000 deliveries.  Independent auto industry researcher Troy Teslike, whose work is closely followed by Tesla fans, had expected deliveries to come in around 409,000.  Tesla’s head of investor relations Martin Viecha sent around a company-compiled consensus based on 30 analysts’ estimates over the weekend to select investors. The consensus, which was viewed by CNBC, said analysts were expecting a mean of 443,027 deliveries and a median of 431,125 deliveries for the quarter.  Tesla faced numerous challenges in the first quarter.  Houthi militia attacks on shippers in the Red Sea disrupted Tesla’s component supply and temporarily suspended production at its German factory outside of Berlin in January. In March, environmental activists set fire to infrastructure near that same factory, depriving Tesla of sufficient operation power and again causing a pause in production.  In China, Tesla faced an onslaught of competition from domestic EV makers, including BYD and newcomers such as the phone maker Xiaomi. After sluggish sales numbers for its China-made cars in January and February, Tesla reduced production of its Model 3 and Model Y at its Shanghai plant and slashed workers’ schedules to 5 days a week from 6 and a half days.  In the U.S., reviews were mixed for Tesla’s newest model — an angular pickup dubbed the Cybertruck — which the EV maker only began to sell in small numbers in December last year.  A series of discounts and incentives appeared to be less effective in driving sales volume than in the past for Tesla.  During the final days of the first quarter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mandated that all sales and service staff install and demo the newest version of the company’s premium driver assistance system for customers in North America before handing over their cars. The system is marketed as Full Self-Driving but doesn’t make Tesla cars autonomous. They require a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.  Shares of Tesla dropped 29% in the first quarter, the biggest decline since the end of 2022 and the third-steepest quarterly plunge since the company’s IPO in 2010.

"Apple hit with more than $1.95 billion EU antitrust fine over music streaming";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b6agqo/apple_hit_with_more_than_195_billion_eu_antitrust/";"The European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, on Monday hit Apple with a 1.8 billion euro ($1.95 billion) antitrust fine for abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.  The Commission said it found that Apple had applied restrictions on app developers that prevented them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app.  Apple also banned developers of music streaming apps from providing any instructions about how users could subscribe to these cheaper offers, the Commission alleged.  This is Apple’s first antitrust fine from Brussels and is among one of the biggest dished out to a technology company by the EU.  The European Commission opened an investigation into Apple after a complaint from Spotify in 2019. The probe was narrowed down to focus on contractual restrictions that Apple imposed on app developers which prevent them from informing iPhone and iPad users of alternative music subscription services at lower prices outside of the App Store.  Apple’s conduct lasted almost 10 years, according to the Commission, and “may have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions because of the high commission fee imposed by Apple on developers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher subscription prices for the same service on the Apple App Store.”  Apple response:  In a fiery response to the fine, Apple said Spotify would stand to gain the most from the EU pronouncement.  “The primary advocate for this decision — and the biggest beneficiary — is Spotify, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. Spotify has the largest music streaming app in the world, and has met with the European Commission more than 65 times during this investigation,” Apple said in a statement.  “Today, Spotify has a 56 percent share of Europe’s music streaming market — more than double their closest competitor’s — and pays Apple nothing for the services that have helped make them one of the most recognisable brands in the world.”  Apple said that a “large part” of Spotify’s success is thanks to the Cupertino giant’s App Store, “along with all the tools and technology that Spotify uses to build, update, and share their app with Apple users around the world.”  Apple said that Spotify pays it nothing. That’s because instead of selling subscriptions in their iOS app, Spotify sell them via their own website stead. Apple does not collect a commission on those purchases.  Developers over the years have spoken out against the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.  Spotify did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.  The fine will ramp up tensions between Big Tech and Brussels at a time when the EU is increasing scrutiny of these firms.  Last year, the Commission designated Apple among other tech firms like Microsoft and Meta as “gatekeepers” under a landmark regulation called the Digital Markets Act, which broadly came into effect last year.  The term gatekeepers refers to massive internet platforms which the EU believes are restricting access to core platform services, such as online search, advertising, and messaging and communications.  The Digital Markets Act aims to clamp down on anti-competitive practices from tech players, and force them to open out some of their services to other competitors. Smaller internet firms and other businesses have complained about being hurt by these companies’ business practices.  These laws have already had an impact on Apple. The Cupertino, California-based giant announced plans this year to open up its iPhone and iPad to alternative app stores other than its own. Developers have long-complained about the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.

"MercadoLibre seems absurdly undervalued.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16edgp1/mercadolibre_seems_absurdly_undervalued/";"My portfolio is up 50% this year.  I have a portfolio that is 100% growth stocks and I’ve taken some time to look at valuations to evaluate if I have companies that seem to be over their skis in terms of valuation.  I’ve been looking at lots of stocks in terms of reverse dfc and it seems to me that MercadoLibre is undervalued by about 50%.  They are still growing sales by more than 30% y/y and are improving their operating margin by increasing take rates and reducing costs.  They turn out outstanding results quarter after quarter and when faced with competitive threats from players such as Amazon and Shopee, they just keep coming out on top.  I have a somewhat focused portfolio of 9 stocks, but with the numbers I’m seeing, I just really want to put everything into MercadoLibre (not that I have a big portfolio - just around 30k)  Every other growth stock I evaluate seems either overvalued or reasonably valued, taking into account ten years of reasonable growth assumptions.  Take Nvidia for example.  I own Nvidia and based on my reverse DCF, if they can grow FCF by 30% for ten years, the stock is currently fairly valued.  I think they might be able to pull that off, so Nvidia might be worth owning.  But according to the same model, MercadoLibre only needs to grow FCF 11% annually over the next 10 years to justify their current valution.  This just seems like an absurdly low bar for them.  If my model is off, it would be off in the same direction for all the companies im evaluating.  Part of me thinks I should just invest in this one company that has both amazing fundamentals and low valuation.  Another part of me is just saying “hell no!  Always stay diversified!”  It’s like Cramer vs Munger in my head.  One voice says “5 stocks minimum”. The other says, “why buy anything but your best idea?”  Peter Lynch is also in my head.  I live in Mexico and use Mercado Libre’s services, so it’s a company I can get behind on a personal level.  I think Lynch would approve.  I’ve just never put all my money into one stock before, but this seems like an insane bargain.    What do you think?

"Amazon to invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, a rival to ChatGPT developer OpenAI";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16rmvdx/amazon_to_invest_up_to_4_billion_in_anthropic_a/";"E-commerce giant Amazon on Monday said it will invest up to $4 billion in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic and take a minority ownership position in the company.The move underscores Amazon’s aggressive AI push as it looks to keep pace with rivals such as Microsoft and Alphabet’sGoogle.  Anthropic was founded roughly two years ago by former OpenAI research executives and recently debuted its new AI chatbot called Claude 2. Amazon is looking to capitalize on the hype and promise of so-called generative AI, which includes technology like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, as well as Anthropic’s Claude chatbots.  The two firms on Monday said that they are forming a strategic collaboration to advance generative AI, with the startup selecting Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider. Anthropic said it will provide AWS customers with early access to unique features for model customization and fine-tuning capabilities.  Anthropic will also use custom AWS-designed semiconductors to train the foundational models that underpin its AI applications. Foundation models are large AI programs trained on vast amounts of data so that they can be adapted to solve a wide range of tasks.   This year, chip firm Nvidia is the chip firm that has seen the biggest gains from the generative AI boom. Nvidia’s key product is a type of semiconductor known as a graphics processing unit, which can be used to train huge AI models. At one point Nvidia’s stock had rallied more than 200%, as the company smashed through financial forecasts on the rising adoption of AI.  To an extent, Amazon’s deal with Anthropic aims to show that there are alternative chips that can be used for AI applications. AWS customers will be able to build on Anthropic’s AI models via Amazon Bedrock — a service that lets customers build generative AI applications in the cloud via existing models, rather than train their own models.  Amazon is looking to position itself as the one-stop shop for AI. The e-commerce giant designs its own chips for training huge AI models. Through Amazon Bedrock customers can also design their own generative AI applications using existing models, which are all run on the Amazon cloud. The company sells its own AI applications too.  Anthropic already counts some high-profile backers, including Google and Salesforce Ventures. This support comes as tech giants continue to make massive bets on AI companies, a move sparked by Microsoft’s multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI in January.  https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/25/amazon-to-invest-up-to-4-billion-in-anthropic-a-rival-to-chatgpt-developer-openai.html";"458";"2023-09-25T11:01:26"

Intel stands out as the week's biggest winner among large-cap tech stocks, surging 13%, driven by robust demand for PCs following better-than-expected profit and sales reports. Mizuho Securities upgraded Intel to a buy rating, citing a renewed focus on the data center business and positive prospects in the customer pipeline.  Next week, the spotlight shifts to semiconductors, with Nvidia set to report results. The stock has surged 22% in three weeks, boasting a year-to-date gain of 237%, outpacing other S&P 500 members. Nvidia's strong performance is attributed to its role in generative artificial intelligence, providing graphics processing units (GPUs) for powerful workloads. Analysts expect revenue growth of over 170% for Q3 and anticipate Nvidia's forecast to suggest close to 200% growth in Q4.  Eric Jackson, founder of EMJ Capital, considers Nvidia his ""top large-cap name"" and sees the tech market in the early stages of a rebound, linked to the potential end of Federal Reserve rate hikes. The market is sensitive to interest rates, with low costs encouraging risk-taking and higher rates directing investors to safer assets.  Tame U.S. inflation data, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) remaining flat in October, boosts the broader market.

AMD added that it expected all of its major businesses, including server and PC chips, to decline sequentially during the quarter.  Net income in the fourth quarter was $667 million, or $0.41 per share, versus $21 million, or $0.01 per share a year ago.  AMD makes graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are needed to train and deploy generative artificial intelligence models. While that market is currently dominated by Nvidia, AMD has said that its new AI chips introduced last year will challenge Nvidia’s H100 GPUs for some applications, and investors are looking for significant growth in the company’s data center segment over the next few years.  In October, AMD said it expected $2 billion in server GPU sales in 2024.  But historically, AMD’s main business has been central processors, or CPUs, for PCs and servers. Compared to AI chips, that part of the semiconductor industry has been flat or shrinking over the past few years, as PC sales have suffered post-pandemic.  Data center, which includes server CPUs and AI chips, rose 38% on an annual basis to $2.28 billion in sales. It’s now firmly AMD’s largest business and the company said that much of the increase in revenue was attributable to “strong growth” for sales of its Instinct graphics processors, which are used for AI.  However, AMD’s overall performance in the business was in line with a $2.29 billion FactSet estimates for the Data Center business.  AMD’s client group, which is comprised mostly of chips for PCs and laptops, rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.

"Dell surges 9% on optimism it has secured big AI server orders ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cst8qv/dell_surges_9_on_optimism_it_has_secured_big_ai/";"Dell shares rose more than 9% on Wednesday to an all-time high after Morgan Stanley raised its price target and predicted that the company would rake in sales from the insatiable demand for artificial intelligence servers.  Dell is seeing accelerating momentum, especially in winning business to build AI servers, unlocking a new bull case for the stock, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note on Wednesday. He upgraded his price target on Dell from $128 per share to $152 a share and called it a top pick.  “All-in, we are hearing about more AI server momentum at Dell than at any other OEM,” Woodring wrote, saying that he expected about $10 billion of AI server revenue in the company’s fiscal 2025 — ending next February.  Wednesday’s move was the largest since March 1, when the stock surged after earnings showed that the computer manufacturer has benefited from the AI boom.  Dell shares are now up over 95% in 2024, trailing the 220% gain from rival AI servermaker Super Micro Computer but surpassing Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s 5% gains this year.  Most AI servers are built around Nvidia’s chips, which have become prized in the technology industry because they are used to deploy advanced AI models from companies like Google, OpenAI and Meta. Dell sells servers using the newest Nvidia AI chips, including its H100 GPU and the latest Blackwell-generation chips.  At Nvidia’s annual conference in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang appeared to send customers who want the latest AI chips to Dell for orders.  “You’re going to need an AI factory,” Huang said. “And nobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell.”  “Michael [Dell] is here and he’s happy to take your order,” Huang continued.  “While the near-exponential ramp of Nvidia GPU shipments and AI servers builds make it difficult to pin down exact growth rates,” Woodring wrote, he has confidence in Dell’s business for various reasons. Among those reasons are the strengthening demand for AI servers and that he models Dell’s market share increasing.  He wrote that Dell may be able to upsell its customers and “attach” additional hardware, such as data storage.  Dell is expected to announce its April quarter earnings on May 30. Nvidia reports earnings for its quarter ending in April on May 22.  Dell’s other business, building PCs for consumers and businesses running Microsoft Windows, could get a boost next week when Microsoft reveals new capabilities at its conference, including long-awaited AI features that many analysts expect to drive demand for new PCs.  PC sales have slumped for two years in a post-pandemic hangover, as consumers and enterprises who bought new machines during 2020 and 2021 pushed back the timeline for their next upgrades.  But the PC industry is on course to grow again and is outperforming lowered expectations, Woodring wrote, which will benefit Dell.  “We remain bullish on the PC market recovery as we are not only hearing about upgrade/refresh demand in our recent CIO and VAR checks, but also seeing upward revisions to notebook ODM builds in recent months,” Woodring wrote.

I think what makes TSM different is it just cranks out the chips that its customers design. Please correct me if I am wrong here….  It has been on a tear for the past six months.

Here are the results:  - Earnings: $2.11 per share vs. $2.22 per share expected by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.  - Revenue: $8.83 billion vs. $8.71 billion expected by LSEG.  - Total memberships expected: 260.8 million vs. 256 million expected, according to Street Account  - The company now has 260.8 million paid subscribers, a new record for the streamer.  In October, the company said it added 8.76 million paid memberships in the third quarter, pushing its total to 247 million. Wall Street expects Netflix to have continued that trend in the fourth quarter, with forecasts projecting another 8 million to 9 million paid membership adds, bringing the company to roughly 256 million. Netflix took another step toward building subscribers when it announced earlier Tuesday that it would stream the popular WWE Raw starting next year. The deal is the streaming platform’s biggest step yet into live entertainment.  Netflix is still navigating its transformation from targeting subscriber growth to focusing on profit, using price hikes, password crackdowns and ad-supported tiers to boost revenue. Investors got a sneak preview of growth in Netflix’s advertising-based plan earlier this month, when the company’s president of advertising, Amy Reinhard, told attendees at the Variety Entertainment Summit at CES that the company now has more than 23 million global monthly active users.

"Intel awarded up to $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act grants, with billions more in loans available";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bjd2an/intel_awarded_up_to_85_billion_in_chips_act/";"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/20/intel-awarded-up-to-8point5-billion-from-chips-act-with-loans-available.html  The White House said Intel has been awarded up to $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding, as the Biden administration ramps up its effort to bring semiconductor manufacturing to U.S. soil.  Intel could receive an additional $11 billion in loans from the CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed in 2022. The awards will be announced by President Joe Biden in Arizona on Wednesday.  The money will help “leading-edge semiconductors made in the United States” keep “America in the driver’s seat of innovation,” U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said on a call with reporters. Intel and the White House said their agreement is nonbinding and preliminary and could change.  Intel has long been a stalwart of the U.S. semiconductor industry, developing chips that power many of the world’s PCs and data center servers. However, the company has been eclipsed in revenue by Nvidia, which leads in artificial intelligence chips, and has been surpassed in market cap by rival AMD and mobile phone chipmaker Qualcomm.  Even with its slide relative to its peers, Intel is uniquely situated in the industry because it operates chip factories, or fabs, in addition to designing processors. AMD and Nvidia, are fabless, which means they design the chip, then send computer files and staff to Taiwan’s TSMC for the manufacturing of the device.  TSMC has dominated the leading edge of semiconductor manufacturing in recent years, so all of the world’s fastest processors are physically built in Taiwan.  That’s a big reason why Intel was long expected to be one of the largest beneficiaries of the CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) Act, which targeted the unlocking of nearly $53 billion in incentives for domestic chip technology. A key motivation behind the CHIPS Act was to encourage companies to build fabs on U.S. soil to prevent a supply disruption should China ever invade Taiwan.  Intel said it would spend its CHIPS Act funds on fabs and research centers in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. The company previously announced plans to spend $100 billion on U.S. programs and facilities. Intel has announced a plan to catch up in leading-edge manufacturing by 2026.  Intel’s Ohio fab will cost more than $20 billion and Intel said it is expected to start production in 2027 or 2028. Intel is also expanding manufacturing operations in Arizona and New Mexico. Intel says the projects will create jobs for 20,000 people in fab construction and 10,000 people in chip manufacturing.  The Ohio fab will make AI chips for Intel as well as potentially fabricate AI chips for other semiconductor companies, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on a call with reporters.  “Go drive by the Ohio site,” Gelsinger said. “There are a whole lot of cranes and concrete job trucks that are building what we believe will become the premier manufacturing location, at scale, particularly for AI chips in America.”  GlobalFoundries, Microchip, and BAE Systems have already received CHIPS Act money, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. TSMC is expected to receive CHIPS Act funds for a fab in Arizona that will be used for Apple and AMD chips.";"465";"2024-03-20T14:10:26"

"This AI stock may be a bit overpriced, but I think the hype is right.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14d5tft/this_ai_stock_may_be_a_bit_overpriced_but_i_think/";"**-Nvidia stock is trading at more than 200 times earnings following terrific gains this year.**   **-The acceleration in the chipmaker's growth should help it justify its rich valuation, and its forward P/E ratio suggests that it may not be too overpriced.**   **-Nvidia has impressive upside potential and could turn out to be a solid long-term pick.**     **This high-flying stock could be a buy even after eye-popping gains so far in 2023.**  The craze around artificial intelligence (AI) has sent shares of several companies soaring this year. Nvidia ($NVDA) is one of the foremost examples of this trend -- shares of the semiconductor giant have jumped a whopping 180% so far in 2023.  This terrific rally has made shares of Nvidia very expensive as the stock is now trading at 213 times trailing earnings and 39 times sales. Those multiples are significantly higher than Nvidia's already expensive five-year average P/E of 67 and sales multiple of 18. For some more perspective, the S&P 500 has a price-to-sales ratio of 2.45 and earnings multiple of 19.      So, it is safe to say that Nvidia stock is expensive by quite some margin. However, the forward earnings multiple of 52, based on estimates, suggests that the company's earnings are on track to grow at a rapid pace. Nvidia's forward earnings ratio also suggests that the stock is only a tad overpriced when compared to its five-year average forward earnings multiple of 41.   As a result, it makes sense for investors who are looking to take advantage of the AI boom to consider buying Nvidia even after its red-hot rally. A closer look at the company's prospects will make it clear that it is indeed worth the hype.     **Nvidia AI-driven growth is just getting started**  The impact of AI on Nvidia's financial performance became very clear when the company released its fiscal 2024 first-quarter results last month. While revenue fell 13% year over year during the quarter that ended on April 30, to $7.2 billion, the company is estimating a 64% year-over-year jump in revenue in the current quarter, to $11 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range.  The data center business is the biggest reason Nvidia expects a solid acceleration in growth in the current quarter, as this segment is benefiting strongly from the adoption of generative AI.      On the company's latest conference call with analysts, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said that companies are ""racing to deploy"" Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to meet growing AI demand. The demand for Nvidia's graphics cards is so strong that the company is reportedly struggling to keep up. Supply issues have reportedly led to a sharp jump in the prices of Nvidia's AI-capable GPUs, with the company reportedly commanding a premium of as much as 40% in China.      The impressive pricing power that Nvidia is enjoying can be attributed to the semiconductor giant's dominant position in the market for AI chips. New Street Research estimates that Nvidia controls a whopping 95% of the market for GPUs that can be deployed for machine learning in data centers. Meanwhile, HSBC estimates that Nvidia enjoys a 90% share of processors used for generative AI applications.      All this indicates that Nvidia is crushing it in the market for AI chips, and it could win big from the same in the long run as the demand for these chips is set to boom even more. Nvidia looks to be at the beginning of a massive growth curve thanks to AI, which should help the company justify its expensive valuation by helping it sustain outstanding growth in the long run.  &#x200B:  **The stock is built for more upside**  Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia  to sustain momentum over the next five years, which is not surprising given the huge opportunity in AI chips discussed above.  Bank of America global research analyst Vivek Arya projects that the adoption of generative AI services could help Nvidia increase its revenue at an annual pace of 25% through 2027. The company is expected to finish fiscal 2024 (which will end in January 2024) with revenue of of almost $40 billion. Assuming it does clock 25% annual revenue growth through the end of 2027 (which will coincide with its fiscal 2028), its top line could jump to nearly $100 billion at the end of the forecast period.      For comparison, Nvidia delivered $27 billion in revenue in fiscal 2023, suggesting that its revenue could nearly quadruple over a five-year period. The stock sports a five-year average sales multiple of 18. While that's rich, it wouldn't be surprising to see Nvidia maintain a similar multiple after five years given its tremendous AI opportunity.      If it keeps that multiple and has $100 billion sales, it would have a market cap of $1.8 trillion. That would be 80% higher than Nvidia's current market cap.";"0";"2023-06-19T07:46:01"

Intel has just recently confirmed its ramp in production capacity, while AMD as a fabless company is strongly dependent on foundries like TSMC, who, howerer, have already confirmed to prioritize apple, nvidia and then also intel with their 3nm node.

Gelsinger added that following on from Meteor Lake (expected to be launched later this month), Intel will be ramping its Intel 3 process (5 nm) “soon”. Perhaps more excitingly – and tantalizingly – Gelsinger said that Intel has received a large customer pre-payment for its 18A node (1.8 nm) that has already been successfully taped out and is on track for 2025.  One can only speculate as to which company this “large customer” is. TSMC also claims it is on track for its own 2 nm process node in 2025 and already enjoys the patronage of major customers including Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD, MediaTek along with Apple. Undoubtedly, Intel will be keen to secure at least one of these companies as it helps with its own economies of scale as investing in each of these new process nodes is a multi-billion-dollar endeavor.

"Intel is poised for a Comeback";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16l0k98/intel_is_poised_for_a_comeback/";"\*\*I have a position in INTC\*\*  Intel Corporation is one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. Intel is an integrated device manufacturer (IDM). As a result, Intel designs and manufactures its own chips.  In recent years, Intel has struggled with innovation. Competitors such as TSMC, AMD, and Nvidia have chipped away at Intel’s market share. The previous CEO, Bob Swan, failed to foster a culture of innovation vital to operating in the semiconductor industry. After being replaced in 2021, Bob Swan’s successor, Pat Gelsinger, immediately shifted the company’s focus towards IDM 2.0, focusing on technology and manufacturing capacity. This initiative comes at significant capital costs partially offset by Western nations’ subsidies in the aftermath of global COVID-19 supply chain disruptions.  While risks remain within the plan, IDM 2.0 creates a unique value proposition for potential clients. First, Intel’s current node roadmap is technologically superior to its main competitor, TSMC. Furthermore, Intel will have a geographic monopoly on advanced semiconductor nodes. TSMC’s announced expansions in the United States will no longer be generations behind Intel’s at the estimated time of release.  As a result of these factors, Intel trades at a discount to its Intrinsic value. The market and intrinsic value gap exists due to poor short-term business performance and execution risk.";"190";"2023-09-17T15:22:55"

US short interest this month rose to the highest level since April 2022, as investors bet that the current bull run in the stock market is set to falter.  According to data from S3 Partners, the amount spent by short sellers against US stocks hit $1.02 trillion, as of Friday. Those bets came even as they continued to rally earlier this month, costing short sellers $101 billion.  S3 data shows that the top shorts are Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. As of Friday, their collective short interest topped $83 billion.  The bearish sentiment results from skepticism about how much higher stocks can go. So far this year, the S&P 500 is up 13.5%, and the Nasdaq is up 29%.  But since the Federal Reserve last week indicated more rate hikes are on the table this year, stocks have been on a losing streak.  This year, Wall Street has been caught up in the hype over artificial intelligence companies, which saw their valuations skyrocket and have brought more investors into the market due to ""fear of missing out.""  But big names have voiced divided outlooks on the AI frenzy. For instance, while Stanley Druckenmiller sees Nvidia as a stock worth holding for the next couple of years, short seller Jim Chanos has demonstrated skepticism towards the stock.  Meanwhile, the prospect of continued hawkishness from the Fed has added to macroeconomic risks. A recent Goldman Sachs report put the odds of a recession in the next 12 months at 25% and warned a downturn could cause a 23% decline in the S&P 500.  Still, if bullish investors win out, short positions could eventually support market gains, as a short squeeze forces more buying and boosts stocks.";"0";"2023-06-24T12:48:34"

"Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven' (apple, meta, google, Microsoft, Tesla..)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14w58g3/nasdaq_100_plans_special_rebalance_to_curb/";"From https://www.investors.com/news/nasdaq-100-plans-special-rebalance-to-curb-dominance-of-magnificent-seven/    The Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the ""magnificent seven"" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.  The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.  The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to ""address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights.""  The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.  The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.   How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted? The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.  The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.  The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.  Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.  Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.  Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.  Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.  Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.  How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut? Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.  Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.  The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.  Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023 The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.  This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.  There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.  Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices? The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.  However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&P 500, which is why S&P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.  The S&P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.  Most of the ""magnificent 7"" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.  The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.  Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.";"105";"2023-07-10T22:25:37"

"Disney beats earnings estimates, hikes guidance as it slashes streaming losses";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aldp6e/disney_beats_earnings_estimates_hikes_guidance_as/";"LOS ANGELES — The Walt Disney Company reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, as the media giant slashed costs while revenue stagnated.   The company hiked its guidance, and now expects fiscal 2024 earnings per share of about $4.60, which would be at least 20% higher than 2023.   Disney said it is on pace to meet or exceed its goal of cutting costs by at least $7.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2024.   Here is what Disney reported compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:  Earnings per share: $1.22 vs. 99 cents expected  Revenue:$23.55 billion vs. $23.64 billion expected   Disney’s direct-to-consumer unit reported a $138 million operating loss in the quarter. Including the performance at ESPN+, losses for all its streaming businesses narrowed to $216 million, from $1.05 billion in the prior-year period.  Disney+ core subscribers shrank by 1.3 million from the prior quarter due to price increases, but the company saw a rise in average revenue per user because of those subscription cost hikes.  The company posted the improvements to its streaming business a day after it announced Tuesday that it will launch a new sports streaming venture among ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery later this year.   While no price has been determined, a logical starting point could be $45 or $50 per month with introductory pricing lower to entice signups, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions around the service have been private.  Disney’s earning results come as its board battles again with activist investor Nelson Peltz and Blackwells Capital.  While Peltz ended a previous proxy battle against Disney a year ago after the company committed to numerous cost-cutting initiatives, he revived his fight last fall, looking to shake up the board and earn himself and former Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo a seat.  Peltz has cited the company’s stock plunge, a drop in consensus earnings estimates and disappointing studio content as he has pushed for a board shake-up.  CEO Bob Iger has publicly addressed Disney’s theatrical release woes and vowed to rely less on sequels and more on fresh, quality films. Of course, production timelines are often in the ballpark of 18 months, so Disney’s box office haul likely will not change until 2025 or 2026. At that point, Disney is slated to release four mega blockbusters: an Avatar film, two Star Wars features and an Avengers team-up flick.  Also of note to investors is this is the second quarter that Disney is using its new financial reporting structure, which segmented the company into three divisions: entertainment, sports and experiences. Entertainment contains all of Disney’s streaming and media operations, sports includes ESPN and experiences includes the company’s theme parks, hotels, cruise line and merchandising efforts.

The company, which makes memory and storage for computers, said it has benefitted from the artificial intelligence boom.  Here’s how the company did:  Earnings per share: 42 cents adjusted vs. 25 cent loss expected by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.  Revenue: $5.82 billion vs. 5.35 billion expected by LSEG.  Micron said revenue rose to $5.82 billion from $3.69 billion in the year ago quarter. The company reported a net income of $793 million, up from a net loss of $2.3 billion in the same period last year.  For its fiscal third quarter, Micron expects to report revenue of $6.6 billion, above the $6.02 billion expected by analysts.  “We believe Micron is one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry of the multi-year opportunity enabled by AI,” Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a release.

But it's not that easy. In fact, following this advice can frequently result in money being left on the table. Outsized gains are typically realised over a multi-year period by allowing winning positions to compound. The best companies have a habit of improving their fundamentals until they reach a premium valuation. This has been the case with a company like Apple, which has effectively compounded its earnings (and bought back its stock) to justify a sustained valuation expansion. Nvidia ($NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ($TSM), and General Electric ($GE) are three well-known stocks that are currently on fire but may still be worth investing in.  **Nvidia is a smart way to invest in AI**   Scott Levine (Nvidia): Falling more than 50% in 2022, Nvidia's stock has roared back in 2023. Since the start of the year, shares of Nvidia have skyrocketed about 160%. While the stock had climbed steadily through the first four months of the year, most recently the catalyst behind the stock's rise was a strong first-quarter 2024 earnings report and guidance for Q2 2024. And, despite the stock's meteoric climb this year, there's still reason to believe shares can fly even higher.      In all likelihood, most investors recognize Nvidia for its prowess in graphics processing units (GPUs). What many may not know, however, is that the company is also at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI) -- an area that has exploded in popularity recently thanks to ChatGPT. While Nvidia played a pivotal role in the development of ChatGPT, the company's AI offerings transcend this one AI chatbot.  Thanks to its industry-leading GPUs -- critical components in training AI -- Nvidia is highly sought after by companies developing AI systems. In late March, for example, Nvidia announced that Alphabet's Google Cloud will be the first cloud services provider to use its L4 GPU for assisting in the development of large generative AI models. A variety of other industry leaders also rely on Nvidia for their AI platforms, including AT&T, Oracle, and Adobe.      With Nvidia's recent rise, the stock is trading at a premium. Currently, shares are valued at 68 times forward earnings. With this steep price tag, it wouldn't be surprising if investors choose to take profits, resulting in a slight decline. Over the long term, though, with some analysts forecasting the generative AI market to rise from $11.3 billion to $51.8 billion in 2028, Nvidia is well positioned to see its stock outperform the market -- especially since the company relies on much more than simply its AI solutions to keep the lights on.  **Taiwan Semi has it all**   Daniel Foelber (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing): Shares of Taiwan Semi have rebounded nicely after a brutal 2022. And for good reason. The stock had sold off primarily due to concerns about a slowing economy (which impacts cyclical chip stocks) and Taiwan Semi's geopolitical risk with China. The industry leader now sells for an inexpensive valuation -- sporting a price-to-earnings ratio of 14 (near a 10-year low).      Shares of Taiwan Semi got an additional boost after Nvidia blew expectations out of the water and soared to a new all-time high. While Taiwan Semi doesn't have the direct exposure to AI that a chip company like Nvidia does, it does provide a catch-all way to benefit from a rising tide in AI and robotics.  Taiwan Semi operates a third-party foundry business that receives designs from customers like Apple, Nvidia, and Advanced Micro Devices (among others) and manufactures chips to their specifications. In this vein, Taiwan Semi is one of the more straightforward ways to indirectly benefit from a growing chip industry. Instead of building a new factory and hoping customers come knocking on the door, Taiwan Semi's expansions are more so in response to its customers demanding higher volumes and increasingly sophisticated products.      There's a short list of third-party foundries that can handle a surge in chip manufacturing as a result of AI and other trends -- giving Taiwan Semi a wide moat in addition to massive growth potential. The biggest risk for this company is geopolitical. However, it is combating that risk by expanding outside of Taiwan with a new 4-nanometer fab in Arizona and a sophisticated technology fab in Japan (both are expected to come online in late 2024).       With an inexpensive valuation, industry leadership, growth opportunities, cheap-looking shares, and a 1.9% dividend yield to boot, there's a lot to like about Taiwan Semi stock -- even though it's run up a lot in the last month.  **GE's end markets keep improving**   Lee Samaha (General Electric): The industrial powerhouse General Electric is up over 55% in 2023 but still has room to run. The reasoning behind this argument is that all three of its end markets continue to improve.    GE is a much smaller company now than in Jack Welch and Jeff Immelt's heydays. Following the healthcare spinoff early this year, GE is now focused on aerospace (mainly commercial with some defense exposure), power (especially gas turbines and services), and renewable energy (wind power and grid solutions).    In aerospace, GE continues to enjoy the benefits of the recovery in commercial aerospace and a gradually improving supply chain. GE Aerospace grew orders by 14% in the first quarter, and its joint venture with Safran, CFM International, is on track to ramp up production of its LEAP engines by 50% in 2023. While the LEAP comes with a negative engine margin, it generates highly lucrative aftermarket revenue spread over decades as the engines are used.    In addition, GE Aerospace may have an opportunity to take market share on the Airbus A320 neo family of aircraft. Its competitor on the airplane, Raytheon Technologies' geared turbofan engine (GTF), has disappointed some airlines with durability issues in harsh environments.    GE Power is heading for another solid year, with management forecasting low-single-digit revenue growth and ""slightly better"" operating profit than in 2022. However, given that the natural gas price has fallen by 74% over the last year and 33% this year, it's likely that gas turbine usage will increase, leading to more services revenue and a possible increase in investment in gas turbines.    Finally, the infrastructure bill is unleashing pent-up demand in GE's core market, U.S. onshore. As such, GE Renewable Energy orders rose 94% in the first quarter to $5.4 billion, driven by onshore wind and two large grid solutions orders to connect renewable energy sources to the grid.    Given the strengthening momentum in its end markets, there's plenty of reason to believe the industrial company could exceed its earnings guidance.";"0";"2023-05-30T11:53:39"
"Snowflake (SNOW) ls worth buying on declines";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bz4fyh/snowflake_snow_ls_worth_buying_on_declines/";"I bought Snowflake #SNOW at $154 today.    **Positives:**  There is some sandbagging in the guidance for the incoming CEO to make a better mark, I don’t believe they’ve completely elaborated on likely growing revenue streams.  New CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy has an excellent resume, 15 years at Google, then he co-founded Neeva, which was bought by Snowflake. With his tech cred he actually has better product knowledge than the outgoing legendary CEO, Frank Slootman, and his tech cred should be a big factor in taking Snowflake forward.  Its partnership with Nvidia is a fairly big deal for a recurring AL/LLM solutions/services. Snowflake’s AI product, Cortex should be out in the second or third quarter of 2024. Snowflake has also responded well to Databricks comparisons and shouldn’t be seen as lagging. The other new product Snowpark should also grow a lot faster.  Snowflake’s free cash flow margin was very impressive at 35% of sales last year. Like most tech companies it doesn’t generate GAAP profits, but this a hugely positive number, it exceeds Crowdstrike’s 30% and several other tech growers. It has indicated 29% free cash flow margin for 2024.  Moving to a consumption model has shown poorer forecasted revenue growth at 22-23% but bookings are growing at much faster levels, Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) grew at 41% so this is not a long term problem.  Negatives  The company is expensive at 15x sales with only 23% growth! Even after the stock being 35% lower than its 52 week high.  It could stay sideways for a year, or if there is another weak quarter, it could drop to $130-135, where it’s down to 12-13 x sales. Look out for a bumpy ride!  ";"220";"2024-04-08T19:52:02"

Investors question whether the stock can live up to the hype.  The dot-com bubble taught investors to be wary of stock-market rallies powered by a technological boom—that is, until generative artificial intelligence sent tech stocks soaring this year.  Shares of Nvidia NVDA -0.39%, the graphics-chip maker at the heart of the frenzy, have nearly tripled in 2023, while the Nasdaq-100 has climbed 38% and the S&P 500 has gained 16%.  For some investors, the surge in Nvidia—now the fifth-largest U.S. company by market value—is difficult to chalk up to anything but speculative mania. Its weighting in the benchmark stock indexes means everyday investors are at the whims of its trajectory, whether they believe in AI’s potential or not.  “There’s a huge boom in AI—some people are scrambling to get exposure at any cost, while others are sounding the alarm that this will end in tears,” said Kai Wu, founder and chief investment officer of Sparkline Capital. “Investors can benefit from innovation-led growth, but must be wary of overpaying for it.”  Nvidia is the primary producer of semiconductors backing artificial-intelligence systems. The company forecast a record $11 billion in sales for the recently ended quarter when it reported results in May, catching analysts off guard with the projected surge in customer demand.  “That’s when the excitement around AI really ramped up,” said Ryan McCormack, an Invesco senior exchange-traded fund strategist.   The hype has driven companies such as Meta Platforms and Amazon.com that have been building out AI capabilities, he said. Shares of the tech giants are up 154% and 65% in 2023, respectively. Microsoft, which has climbed 35%, has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a chatbot that can answer difficult questions in seconds.  The furious rally in those stocks, long the market’s biggest drivers, has fanned worries about market concentration. The 10 biggest stocks in the S&P 500 now comprise more than a third of the market, according to Dow Jones Market Data. They represented 27% of the index at the start of the year and less than a quarter in 2000.  “The market story that rhymes most with the internet bubble is the concentration of leadership,” said Mike Edwards, deputy chief investment officer of Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers.  Nvidia’s second-quarter earnings report, due Aug. 23, will provide insight into whether its inexorable rise is well-rooted in demand for chips, or a product of hype. The stock gained 24% in the trading session after its earnings reported in May, and 14% the day following February’s results.  Investors are paying up for the shares, betting on a windfall down the line. Nvidia is trading at 41 times its sales from the last 12 months, according to FactSet, compared with 2.4 times sales for the S&P 500. On a forward basis, the stock trades at 20 times its expected sales for the year ahead—double its average over the last decade of 10 times, according to Dow Jones Market Data.   The nascency of AI programs such as ChatGPT means it is likely too early to determine whether Nvidia can raise revenue in line with the eye-watering valuation investors have slapped on its shares. If the company’s growth isn’t enough to reflect its price, the stock could crater.  A basket of 43 high-multiple internet stocks—those worth at least $5 billion that traded at 25 times their revenue at the turn of the century—crashed 80% over the next two years, according to Sparkline.   The companies weren’t duds, either. Their sales grew 10-fold in the ensuing two decades. But investors were badly bruised from the bust: The shares returned an average of 16% in that time span. The S&P 500 returned 284%.  The basket included Amazon and Microsoft, both darlings of today’s market, along with Cisco Systems, then one of the largest companies in the Nasdaq-100. The networking- equipment maker traded as high as 38 times its sales in early 2000. Cisco has returned 43% since the start of the century—it is down 0.4% when excluding dividends.  “Valuations matter,” said Wu. “Investing in stocks exposed to rapidly growing technologies only works if the growth is not already priced in. Unfortunately, in periods of euphoria, the market has a tendency not only to price in potential growth, but to greatly overextrapolate it.”  One reason why this rally might lack the boom-and-bust nature of the dot-com bubble: The beneficiaries of artificial intelligence were the stocks already shining this year. Investors were flocking to big tech in the first quarter, seeking shelter in strong balance sheets and cash flows.  Tech companies are also benefiting from the expected end of the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate campaign and resilient consumer spending. Cyclical sectors of the broader market have begun to catch up now that recession fears are fading.   “It’s not like 1999 when investors were racing to hot IPOs for companies that had no chance of making money,” said Edwards. “Today’s winners are disciplined, enormous companies that have moats in place and data sets to exploit.”";"6";"2023-08-11T14:53:17"

As of recently, Google and Meta decide to begin giving out dividends to its shareholders. Is this seen as bullish?   We hold big tech firms due to huge earning growth potential and they tend to distribute their earnings into innovation and R&D, which will with no doubt boost their future earning if done right.   Now that Google and Meta begin to give out dividend, it seems appealing for mutual fund managers to add more into their portfolios, which will boost their stock prices further. But this will probably hurt their future earning potential in long term as they will have less allocated to R&D. What do y'all think?

In a section titled “Enduring franchises highlight our powerful IP and unique monetization capabilities,” Disney indicates that it has seen a 2.9 times and 3.3 times return on investment after purchasing Lucasfilm and Marvel Studios in 2012 and 2009, respectively.*  *In 2012, Disney paid $4 billion for Lucasfilm, giving Disney ownership of the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises.

TSMC now expects its 2023 revenue to drop by 10 per cent, rather than the less than 5 per cent it forecast three months ago, the Taiwanese company told investors on Thursday. This would translate into a 15 per cent revenue decrease in the second half of the year, compared with the same period in 2022.  “Three months ago we were probably more optimistic, but now [we are] not. The recovery of the Chinese economy is weaker than we thought, so end-market demand is not as we expected,” said CC Wei, chief executive. “Although we have very good AI end-market demand, it is not enough to offset [that weakness].”  The warning comes as the growth of large language models behind generative AI services such as ChatGPT is boosting the need for high-end processors for data centres, with TSMC making chips for Nvidia, whose AI processor business is booming.  https://www.ft.com/content/f433971d-fd8e-4ed3-91e9-e25a96284ea0";"269";"2023-07-20T19:18:11"

"Investors Are Bailing on Cathie Wood’s Popular ARK Fund.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/151iopt/investors_are_bailing_on_cathie_woods_popular_ark/";" Cathie Wood’s flagship exchange-traded fund has rallied more than 50% this year. Investors are using that as an opportunity to get out.  They have pulled a net $717 million from the ARK Innovation ETF over the past 12 months, according to FactSet. That exodus marks a notable shift for a fund that had consistently drawn investor cash since its 2014 inception. Once the largest actively managed ETF with nearly $30 billion in assets under management, the fund has shrunk to roughly $9 billion, mostly due to investment losses.  Known by its ticker symbol ARKK, Wood’s fund became an investor darling shortly after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic with hugely successful bets on unprofitable and “disruptive” technology companies. It took in huge amounts of investor money, culminating with a $6.5 billion inflow in the first quarter of 2021, when its share price peaked.  Then, the Federal Reserve’s fastest interest-rate hiking campaign in decades crushed the valuations of unprofitable growth companies, which often attract investors when interest rates are low and returns on safer investments such as CDs are minimal. Shares of ARKK plunged 67% in 2022, but its investors largely held on or bought the dip. Now, analysts say they expect some of those investors are getting out for good.  “You have a whole group of people who got in somewhere near the top and are sitting on horrific losses,” said Matthew Tuttle, chief executive of Tuttle Capital Management, which operates an inverse ETF that lets investors bet against Wood’s fund. “I think some of those people have said, ‘I’m never getting back to even: this is probably the best I’m going to do, and it’s time to get out.’”  Wood says the outflows have been small compared with the fund’s assets.  “We have been astonished at our asset retention since February of ‘21,” Wood said in an interview. “It’s a very small number as a percentage of assets, which suggests that it’s far more likely to be people who are taking some profits than some exodus of people who have stayed in the fund through a prolonged down period.”  Despite the recent rally, ARKK shares are trading about 70% below their all-time high. The S&P 500 has climbed 17% this year on hopes the Fed is near the end of its tightening effort: it is still down 6.1% from its early 2022 high.  ARKK’s top five holdings are Tesla, Coinbase Global, Roku, Zoom Video Communications and Block. Only Tesla and Zoom were profitable last year. Tesla holds an 11% weight in the fund, helping power its advance this year. Shares of the electric-vehicle maker have more than doubled in 2023 but, like ARKK, are down sharply from their previous high.  Although technology stocks are strongly back in favor this year, the best performers have mostly been mature, profitable companies that generate significant cash, such as Microsoft and Amazon.com. Unlike two years ago, investors appear to have less interest and patience for companies that aren’t expected to turn a profit until years in the future. Higher interest rates have meant there is a much higher opportunity cost to wait for profitability.  “There’s certainly been a change in sentiment from when the ARK funds were doing really well,” said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF data and analytics at CFRA Research. “A lot of the stocks the ETF holds won’t have big cash flows until way out in the future, and it’s a more challenging environment for that with rates expected to be higher for longer.”  Investors say the ARK brand lost its luster after the fund’s prodigious fall. It took another hit after missing out on the monster rally in shares of Nvidia, the graphics-chip maker at the heart of the boom of interest in artificial-intelligence technology. ARKK sold the last of its Nvidia position in January, a stake that had long been one of its largest holdings. Nvidia has been the S&P 500’s best performer this year, more than tripling.  “The bloom is off the rose a little bit,” Tuttle said.  Wood says the negative publicity over the past two years has been an opportunity for ARK to solidify its brand as an asset manager focused on disruptive innovation.  “I can tell you at the end of ’20 and early ‘21, when we couldn’t do anything wrong and people were just chasing, I felt very uncomfortable,” she said. “Today, I feel very comfortable. We are not seeing that kind of behavior. That tells me there is a wall of worry out there. And that usually sustains a bull market.”  The outflows at ARK are coming while ETF investors appear eager to put money to work in other funds. June was the best month for equity ETF flows since October, according to State Street, while active funds attracted $10 billion of inflows for the month and more than $100 billion over the past 12 months.  Investors displayed “childlike exuberance” and “jumped into the market’s rally with both feet,” Matthew Bartolini, head of Americas research for State Street’s ETF business, said in a research note.  The ARKK fund has an 11% annualized average return since inception, but the average ARKK investor has lost 21% on a dollar-weighted, annualized basis, according to FactSet.  “ARKK shareholders have not timed their purchases well. Many bought high and have yet to sell,” said Elisabeth Kashner, director of global funds research at FactSet.  The fund remains a cash cow for Wood, who owns a majority stake in its parent company, ARK Investment Management. Its 0.75% annual fee is about double the average fee for active ETFs.  Although fee revenue is well off its 2021 peak, ARKK has generated more than $20 million of fees this year. ARK Investment Management currently has the third-highest daily revenue from active equity ETFs, of at least 145 different issuers, according to an analysis from FactSet.  To be sure, the market comeback staged by many of ARKK’s tech-focused holdings surprised many, highlighting the perils of trying to forecast performance.  “If you just look at rates, you would not have expected this great rebound in growth coming into the year,” said Dana D’Auria, co-chief investment officer at Envestnet. “It’s a classic window into why market prognostication doesn’t work. Who would have thought artificial intelligence would boom and create this massive interest?”  https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-are-bailing-on-cathie-woods-popular-ark-fund-dbf5d801?mod=hp_lead_pos2";"460";"2023-07-16T23:48:07"
"Arm shares spike 24% after chip designer gives strong forecast, says AI is increasing sales";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1alek9u/arm_shares_spike_24_after_chip_designer_gives/";"Arm reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat estimates and gave a strong profit forecast for the current quarter. The shares soared more than 20% in extended trading.  Here’s how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending December:  Revenue: $824 million, vs. $761 million expected  EPS: 29 cents adjusted, vs 25 cents expected.   Arm, whose chip design technology is in nearly every smartphone and many PCs, said it expects earnings per share for the fiscal fourth quarter of between 28 cents and 32 cents on sales of $850 million to $900 million. Analysts expectations earnings of 21 cents per share on sales of $780 million.  The company reported net income of $87 million, or 8 cents per share. Total revenue in the quarter increased 14% from a year earlier.  Arm makes money through royalties, when companies pay for access to build Arm-compatible chips, usually amounting to a small percentage of the final chip price.  Arm said its customers shipped 7.7 billion Arm chips during the September quarter, which is the most recent period which figures are available.  Royalty revenue increased 11% on an annual basis to $470 million. The company said the jump was partially because of a recovery in the smartphone market, as well as increasing sales to automotive companies and cloud providers. Arm said that it expects growth to be driven by royalty revenue.  In recent years, Arm has emphasized its licensing business, selling access to more complete designs that semiconductor companies can take and plug into their planned chips. That process saves chipmakers time and effort, and it’s more lucrative for Arm than simply collecting royalties.  Arm’s license and other revenue was $354 million, up 18% year-over-year. Arm said more companies were choosing to license its CPU designs to run artificial intelligence, and that the company charges higher licensing fees for advanced designs.  Arm, which had been owned by SoftBank, went public in September. The company was founded in 1990 to develop technology for low-power chips, but became more important to the overall technology industry when the Apple  iPhone and competing Android devices standardized on Arm-based chips.  Arm says that companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia use its technology.  Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/07/arm-earnings-report-q3-2024-.html";"598";"2024-02-07T22:43:28"

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.  But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.  Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

"The world's wealthiest people have seen their fortunes grow by more than $150 billion thanks to the AI-fueled stock-market boom";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14e2plu/the_worlds_wealthiest_people_have_seen_their/";"* AI-related stocks have seen a spectacular surge in 2023, following ChatGPT's smashing debut.    * Some of the world's wealthiest people have made a killing from the rally.    * Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and Oracle boss Larry Ellison have seen their personal fortunes swell by over $40 billion each.  Artificial intelligence has been one of the defining themes for stocks in 2023 – and it's also helping the rich get richer.      The surge in interest in the intelligent language tool ChatGPT quickly spread across markets, with big-name investors rushing to snap up shares in companies they believe could power AI's rise to prominence.      Big Tech giants like Meta Platforms and Nvidia have already racked up triple-digit gains thanks to the AI boom, while Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, and Oracle have also all surged.      That's helped the companies' founders – already among the world's richest people at the start of 2023 – to become even wealthier.  Meta shares have rallied 134% year-to-date thanks to both the rise of AI and Zuckerberg's so-called ""year of efficiency"" cost cuts, and that's lifted the Facebook founder's wealth by over $57 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.      Meanwhile, Oracle founder Larry Ellison passed Bill Gates on the publication's rich list for the first time ever earlier this week, with his fortune up $47 billion in 2023 thanks to the tech stock's 55% gain.      Gates himself has gotten $24 billion richer this year thanks to his Microsoft shares, with the Redmond-based tech giant emerging as a preferred AI play for billionaire investors including Stanley Druckenmiller.      And the man at the helm of one of the stock market's biggest success story of 2023 – Nvidia founder Jensen Huang – has also seen his personal fortune balloon by $24 billion, according to Bloomberg's index.  Again, that's largely thanks to Huang's shares in the chipmaker, which have jumped 192% in value to lift the company to a $1 trillion market capitalization.      The members of the rich list have seen their combined wealth jump by over $150 billion in 2023, by Insider's calculations.";"179";"2023-06-20T08:06:37"

"Passive investing bubble brought to you in part by ETF’s";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anzzma/passive_investing_bubble_brought_to_you_in_part/";"So you know how in most of the melt up’s/meltdowns there’s usually a product that’s largely responsible?  Usually no one can see it coming, in 2007/8 it was overlevering bad loans through CDO’s.  Today I was trying to track where the volume was coming from on one of my stocks. I found a declaration of 5% ownership by Blackrock in the SEC filings. So this pointed me towards their Ishares line of ETF’s. These “modified market cap weighted” ETF’s seem to forget the market cap weighted in favour of the modified part.   Money is being channeled by Vangaurd, Blackrock Etc… into a select few “unicorns”. I believe that’s why there’s no breadth in rallies, the passive investing money hose is selectively focused.   The investing mandates are created when the ETF’s are established, so all that’s left to do is rebalance. What results from this? The investment mandate might make sense at the time, all of this passive investing pushes the price to levels where the fundamentals don’t quite make sense anymore. The fund managers don’t give a shit, and why would they? It’s not their money and the more they have under management the more they’re earning in management fees. The folks supplying the money are too far removed from the investing to see what’s happening. They buy these “diversified ETF’s” that are professionally rebalanced and diversified with the premise of releasing control to the experts.  Here’s an example: why are AMD and NVIDIA almost equally weighted in the SOXX ETF given that NVIDIA is roughly 6x the size of AMD? They should be weighted proportional to their market caps. When fund managers place this metaphorical finger on the scale it creates buying pressure. ETF’s are enabling market makers to use other people’s money to move the markets. This can snowball as the companies that are given a larger allocation in the semi-actively managed ETF’s gain a larger market cap. As the companies market cap becomes a larger portion of the index the passively managed ETF’s begin allocating a larger percent to the company and so on…  I would also hypothesize that more young people are turning to the markets to get ahead more than ever. Let’s face it, the rich housing markets seem out of reach for a lot of people these days. Higher interest rates perpetuate this further. I would be curious to know how many of you also see the equity markets as your means to get ahead in the midst of unaffordable real estate.  What are your thoughts on this? Poke holes in my ideas if you see flaws. Add to the idea if there’s another angle that you see in this line of thought.  I’m fairly convinced that we’re going to see a meltdown. CRE will likely be one of the catalysts. Office space is very difficult to convert to residential. The logistics of plumbing additional bathrooms, space planning, fixturing appliances etc… make it very expensive.   Thanks for reading.";"94";"2024-02-11T05:58:59"

Just trying to familiarize myself with some of the most talked about investment opportunities in the market right now as well as potential stock picks for each. Feel free to correct any info here or add on more. Just looking to start a discussion on the different hot topics lately and the following stock picks that go along with them! I know there are several other big opportunities like weed,crypto,etc just didn’t wanna go overboard   **Lithium ( MALRY, LAC)**   The booming EV market, along awith the growing demand for renewable energy storage, positions lithium as a key investment opportunity. Major automaker's substantial investments in EVs drive the need for lithium-ion batteries, while the increasing focus on sustainable energy ensures a sustained demand for lithium. Despite global lithium deposits, the challenge of securing a stable and cost-effective supply persists, presenting investment potential in companies involved in lithium exploration, mining, and battery production.     **GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, INTL )**   Demand for GPUs comes from AI and machine learning for handling big data in areas like healthcare and finance. Data centers need GPUs for cloud computing as businesses shift operations online. In the gaming industry, GPUs are crucial for high-quality graphics in video games. Cryptocurrency mining, particularly for coins like Ethereum, relies on GPUs for their processing power. Overall, the demand is driven by the growing need for high-performance GPUs in AI, data centers, gaming, and cryptocurrency mining.   **Uranium (BHP, NXE )**   The demand for uranium primarily stems from its crucial role in fueling nuclear power generation. As global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources intensify, the demand for nuclear energy has been on the rise, particularly in emerging economies like China and India. This growing demand, coupled with supply constraints and geopolitical factors affecting uranium production, creates a decent investment opportunity. As countries strive to meet their energy needs while minimizing carbon emissions, uranium stands out as a key component in the clean energy landscape.   &#x200B:  Are you betting on any of these?

"Intel stock drops 6% as company updates chip manufacturing plans";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14fub3p/intel_stock_drops_6_as_company_updates_chip/";"   * Intel stock dropped 6% Wednesday after the company gave investors an update on the company’s turnaround plan to become a foundry competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. * Intel’s new reporting structure could help control costs at the chipmaker, which is seeking to trim as much as $10 billion from its costs over the next three years. * Other chip stocks also fell Wednesday amid a down day for tech stocks.   Intel stock dropped 6% Wednesday after the company gave investors an update on the company’s turnaround plan to become a chip manufacturing company competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.  Wednesday’s update featured Intel’s Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner explaining how the company would soon change the way it reports its financial results to give its foundry business, known as IFS, its own profit-and-loss statement, which would reveal the company’s manufacturing margins.  Intel’s new reporting structure could also help control costs at the chipmaker, which is seeking to trim as much as $10 billion from its costs over the next three years.  The update comes as investors continue to assess Intel’s turnaround plan under CEO Pat Gelsinger, which depends on catching up with TSMC’s manufacturing technology by 2026, a plan it calls “five nodes in four years.” Intel plans to use its own chips to work out problems in its manufacturing before opening the factories to third-party companies.  If Intel catches up with TSMC, then it can compete for contracts to build high-performance chips from companies such as Apple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm  , which don’t run their own manufacturing and currently often opt for TSMC or Samsung manufacturing. Intel said it expected to announce a key customer for its foundry business later this year.  “The manufacturing group will now face the same market dynamics as their foundry counterparts,” Zinsner told analysts. “They’ll need to compete for volume through performance and price as internal customers will have the option to leverage third-party foundries and to attract external foundry volume, they must do the same.”  Wednesday’s update was focused on how Intel would use its manufacturing capabilities for its own chips. It said more updates on the foundry business and third-party customers would come later this year. Intel also said its own chip needs would contribute $20 billion in revenue to the unit next year.  Analysts on the call worried about Intel’s gross margins and asked how this plan would increase them. In April, Intel said its gross margin for the first quarter was 38.4%, down 51.3% in a year. Intel management said Wednesday it was shooting for 60% margins.  Separately, Intel said Wednesday that it planned to sell 20% of an Austrian subsidiary, IMS Nanofabrication, to private equity firm Bain Capital in a deal that valued the unit at $4.3 billion.  “This will turn out to be one of the best acquisitions we’ve ever made, given that level of valuation and investment made,” Zinsner said Wednesday.  Other chip stocks also fell Wednesday amid a down day for tech stocks. AMD  , Intel’s chief rival, fell nearly 6%, while Qualcomm fell more than 3%. Nvidia, which has been boosted by the recent artificial intelligence wave, fell less than 2%.";"210";"2023-06-22T07:20:53"

The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple (AAPL.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O), has benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence applications that has helped it weather the tapering off of pandemic-led demand.   Revenue in the final three months of last year came in at T$625.5 billion ($20.10 billion), according to Reuters calculations, compared with $19.93 billion in the year-ago period.  That beat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's (TSMC) previous prediction for fourth-quarter revenue being in a range of between $18.8-19.6 billion, and also beat an LSEG SmartEstimate of T$617.1 billion drawn from 21 analysts.     *Source:* [https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmcs-december-sales-down-84-yy-2024-01-10/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmcs-december-sales-down-84-yy-2024-01-10/)";"125";"2024-01-10T21:51:34"

This means smaller companies might be able to displace bigger companies.  * I expect a period of growth in the next 6-12 months due to rate hike pausing. In these type of environments investors are going to move out of the safe tech bets (like Apple, Microsoft) and get back into more speculative, smaller cap names.  * I already hold stocks like Google, Amazon, and a lot of Apple & Tesla.

"Intel to invest $4.6 billion in new chip plant in Poland";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14avon6/intel_to_invest_46_billion_in_new_chip_plant_in/";"Intel plans to invest up to $4.6 billion in a new semiconductor assembly and test facility near Wrocław, Poland, as part of a multi-billion-dollar investment drive across Europe to build chip capacity, it said on Friday.  The U.S. chipmaker last year announced plans to build a big chip complex in Germany along with facilities in Ireland and France as it seeks to benefit from European Commission's eased funding rules and subsidies as the EU looks to cut its dependence on U.S. and Asian supply.  The facility in Poland will employ 2,000 workers and create several thousand additional jobs during the construction phase and hiring by suppliers, the company said in a statement.  ""Poland was just a little bit hungrier to win this site,"" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a news conference.  Several countries have been vying to get Intel to invest in their regions and some, like Germany, who have secured a commitment from Intel, have been in talks on the amount of subsidies they can doll out.  Handelsblatt newspaper reported on Thursday that the German government and Intel were close to an agreement for 9.9 billion euros ($10.83 billion) in subsidies, up from a previously agreed 6.8 billion.  ""We are not asking for handouts, we are asking for competitiveness,"" Gelsinger said in an interview.  ""Labour costs have gone up substantially, material costs have gone up substantially, so all of a sudden, the cost gap was bigger than we had originally estimated.""  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will meet with Gelsinger on Monday, a government spokesperson said in Berlin.  Gelsinger declined to provide detail on the subsidy amount, but said he hopes to come to an agreement.  ""The gaps are too big. If we close them, we shake hands, and we are going forward,"" Gelsinger said.  The level of any subsidy offered to Intel by Poland was not made public during Friday's announcement.  Design and planning for the facility will begin immediately, with construction to commence pending European Commission approval.  Mateusz Morawiecki, prime minister of Poland, called Intel's factory ""the largest greenfield investment in the history of Poland"".  The company, which has been in the country for 30 years and employs 4,000 workers, said it chose Poland because of its infrastructure, available talent and noted the site is close to its planned factory in Germany and its site in Ireland.  It expects the facility to come online by 2027.  Intel under Gelsinger has been investing billions in building factories across three continents to restore its dominance in chip making and better compete with rivals AMD, NVIDIA and Samsung.  https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-invest-46-bln-new-chip-plant-poland-2023-06-16/";"1070";"2023-06-16T14:33:40"

Great idea for Intel to open a sizable position in ARM as the IPO anchor imo.

"Where are you building positions?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14w1kpa/where_are_you_building_positions/";"I have a very small portfolio, about 14k. Over the last few years I lost a very, very substantial amount of money as a % of my portfolio making stupid trades. Mostly trying to be too cute with long dated call options that went terribly in the wrong direction and expired worthless, credit spreads, chasing some WSB tickers. Basically trading like I'm in a literal casino.  The last 18 months or so I've mostly gotten back on the right track and have been building positions in the big names that have been traditionally good bets over a long horizon. Google, apple, Amazon, meta, tesla, Microsoft, Nvidia, visa, you get the idea. I recently started a new job and can comfortably put $1000 a month into the market to chase some growth while equally contributing to my savings.  Something nearly all of these companies have in common is that they are all hovering at or near 52 week highs and while I'm not entirely deterred by that it gives me some pause.  Personally my next thought is to build a bigger position in the s&p and nasdaq indices over the next few months since I'm currently concentrated in individual companies.   Beyond that I'm looking into different oil / ng etfs because I don't have any exposure there.   Just curious where other people stand with the run up on some of these more popular large caps and where you're currently looking to get exposure";"55";"2023-07-10T20:12:00"
"Microsoft’s stock hits record after executives predict $10 billion in annual A.I. revenue";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14akdu5/microsofts_stock_hits_record_after_executives/";"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/15/microsoft-stock-hits-record-as-leaders-see-10-billion-in-ai-revenue.html  * Microsoft shares climbed 3.2% to a record Thursday and are now up 46% this year. * The company could pick up $10 billion or more in annual artificial intelligence revenue from developers using its Azure cloud or OpenAI’s models, an executive said this week. * JPMorgan analysts raised their price target on Microsoft stock Wednesday.  Microsoft shares climbed to a record Thursday after analysts at JPMorgan Chase touted the software maker’s growth prospects in artificial intelligence.  The stock rose 3.2% to close at $348.10, topping its prior all-time high reached in November 2021, the same month the Nasdaq peaked. U.S. indexes enjoyed a broad rally, following the Federal Reserve’s announcement Wednesday that it would hold off on increasing interest rates.  AI has been a hot topic all year, after Microsoft-backed OpenAI in November released the ChatGPT chatbot, which quickly went viral. Tech companies have rushed to embed the technology into products and features and have boasted their ability to use AI to drive cost savings as recession concerns persist.  Microsoft is a major beneficiary of the rise of ChatGPT and tangential products. On top of its hefty investment in OpenAI, the company provides the underlying computing power. Microsoft also has an exclusive license on OpenAI’s models, including the GPT-4 large language model that can spit out natural-sounding words in response to a human’s text input.  Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI tools into its Bing search engine and even the Windows operating system. At the company’s event in February to announce its Bing Chatbot, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said “it’s an exciting time in tech.”  Investors want to see what it all means for Microsoft’s earnings and revenue.  In April, Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said she expects fiscal fourth-quarter growth for Azure cloud of 26% to 27% year over year in constant currency, with 1 percentage point of it coming from AI services. On Monday, in a public discussion with Microsoft technology chief Kevin Scott, Hood provided more specifics, saying that “the next generation AI business will be the fastest-growing $10 billion business in our history.”  In the past four quarters, Microsoft has generated almost $208 billion in total revenue.  Scott went deeper on Hood’s prediction.  “Because it really is a very general platform, we have lots of different ways that $10 billion of ARR is going to first show up,” he said. ARR stands for annual recurring revenue.  “There is all of the people who want to come use our infrastructure, whether they’re training their own models, whether they are running an open-source model they’ve got or whether they are making API calls into one of the big frontier models that we’ve built with OpenAI,” Scott said.  Following the event, JPMorgan analysts lifted their price target to $350 from $315.  “While MSFT continues to encounter a broad wave of cloud optimizations weighing on Azure growth, we see it planting the longer-term seeds for success across Security, Teams, Power Apps and now the forward-looking OpenAI/ChatGPT investments,” wrote the analysts, who have the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft stock.  With Microsoft’s 46% rally this year, the stock has recouped all its losses from 2022, when investors rotated out of technology in anticipation of rising interest rates and economic headwinds.  Negative sentiment around cloud growth and a contracting PC market led to pessimism on Wall Street last year. But the excitement around AI in addition to the cost-cutting measures that tech companies implemented produced a renewed bullishness. The Nasdaq is up 32% this year, doubling the gains in the S&P 500.";"494";"2023-06-16T04:14:37"

"INTC vs TSLA - Trying to understand market sentiment.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cc3dtf/intc_vs_tsla_trying_to_understand_market_sentiment/";"Forgive my naive question but I'm really trying to wrap my head around these two stocks (stockholder in both).      INTC - Semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse. Still has a majority in data center and pc CPU space. I do agree that they fell behind TSMC and Samsung in terms of process leadership and don't have a serious product offering in the GPU space that can take on Nvidia H100 (Gaudi 3 seems like a good competitor). And Pat Gelsinger is trying hard to bring it back on track. They have 18A process node on track to hit HVM production in 2025(?), US government is funding their fab expansion plans, Foundry is slowly winning customer, and for the next few years, compute is the new oil. Everything seems to be inline for INTC to go up like AMD and NVDA. But no, it always drops.      TSLA - Eccentric owner who is more interested in peddling conspiracy theories on X that he bought on a whim. FSD was a long lost pipe dream, which never seems to be working fine , and current version has its own kinks. EV is becoming an extremely competitive market everyday with new entrants and an ongoing price war. Cybertruck was late by 2-3(?) years and has. IDK if Roadster will ever happen in this decade, Tesla Semi is another thing which seemed nice on paper but idk if it's ever really gonna happen. News reports claimed that Musk cancelled Model2. But again claims TSLA is gonna make a cheaper model ( which would probably cannibalize Model 3 and Model Y sales: and lets be honest - no one knows if and when that's actually coming on the roads).      Can anyone explain why is the market so bullish about TSLA even after reporting lower EPS, 9% drop in revenue, and is ready to eat his words about the cheaper model like its God's truth itself, while INTC drops like a rock on the first opportunity, even though Semiconductors are the bedrock of AI and EV growth.";"91";"2024-04-24T18:58:45"
"Berlin, Intel strike deal on $33 billion chip plant after months of subsidy talks";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14df4ri/berlin_intel_strike_deal_on_33_billion_chip_plant/";"BERLIN/STOCKHOLM, June 19 (Reuters) - Intel (INTC.O) will invest more than 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in Germany as part of its expansion push in Europe, the U.S. company said on Monday, a project key to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ambitions to create a global chip hub.      The deal, which involves two leading-edge semiconductor facilities, involves 10 billion euros in German subsidies, a person familiar with the matter said.      Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said he was grateful to the German government and the local state of Saxony-Anhalt, where the company plans to built one plant, for ""fulfilling the vision of a vibrant, sustainable, leading-edge semiconductor industry in Germany and the EU"".      Under Gelsinger, Intel (INTC.O) has been investing billions in building factories across three continents to restore its dominance in chipmaking and better compete with rivals AMD (AMD.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Samsung (005930.KS).      The deal in Germany would be Intel's third big investment in four days, following a $4.6 billion chip plant in Poland and a $25 billion factory in Israel.      Both the United States and Europe are trying to lure big industrial players via a mix of state subsidies and favourable legislation, with Berlin concerned about losing appeal as a place to invest.      The German government is investing billions of euros in subsidies to lure tech companies to Germany amidst growing alarm over supply chain fragility and dependence on South Korea and Taiwan for chips.      Berlin is currently also talking with Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) and Sweden's electric vehicle battery maker Northvolt about setting up production in Germany, having already convinced Tesla (TSLA.O) to build its first European gigafactory there.      Frankfurt-listed Intel shares were 0.3% lower at 1316 GMT.      The chipmaker last year announced plans to build a big chip complex in Germany, along with facilities in Ireland and France, as it seeks to benefit from the European Commission's eased funding rules and subsidies as the EU tries to cut its dependence on U.S. and Asian supply.      It has not yet specified the exact size of the investment.      Gelsinger told Reuters on Friday that the gap between what Germany had offered and what Intel needed was too big but he expected to reach an agreement, adding that his request was to be cost competitive.      ""We lost this industry to Asia, we have to be competitive if we're going to bring it back,"" he said, adding the overall investment for the site would be ""tens of billions of dollars"".

While I don’t believe it will get close to Nvidia’s near monopolistic market share of 80% there is ample room for more competitors and AMD will benefit from the AI boom as well.   It recently upped its guidance for 2024 for artificial intelligence-related revenue to $3.5B up from $2B previously.  $AMD Chief Executive Dr. Lisa Su said she had ""good confidence"" the company will be able to exceed the $3.5B figure this year and the $1.5B run-rate for the coming fourth-quarter. $1.5Bn run rate implies $6Bn in annual sales.   However, based on Citi analyst estimates, AMD is likely to generate $5B this year and $8B next year from the MI300 - they believe that Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are the largest customers for the MI300, which was unveiled in December to much fanfare. And with the average selling price at roughly $10,000 for Microsoft and $15,000 or more for other customers, it's possible AMD is purposefully underestimating sales figures, possibly on supply concerns?   For Q4-2023 AMD results were in line with expectations   EPS: $0.77 per share, adjusted, versus $0.77 per share expected   Revenue: $6.17 billion, versus $6.12 billion expected   Data Center revenue $2.28Bn in line V $2.29 expected.   Guidance was light:   Q1-24 $5.4Bn in sales, plus or minus $300 million, V $5.73 Bn expected.   Flat data center revenue with server chip declines to be offset by AI GPU sales. We saw weak data center revenue from Intel, this is definitely some cannibalization and likely to continue, till AI GPU starts taking a larger share of the pie.   Client Group - The recovery in PC’s helped AMD’s client group, which rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.   Gaming, which includes “semi-custom” processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a “significant” double-digit percentage in the current quarter. This is a low margin business and drags AMD’s overall margins.   AMD’s embedded segment, which includes chips for networking, reported $1.1 billion in sales, down 24% on an annual basis.";"254";"2024-02-10T23:08:45"

For the period ending July 1, Intel (INTC) earned an adjusted 13 cents per share on $12.9B in revenue, as the company's Client Computing Group generated $6.78B in revenue, above estimates.   Revenue attributed to its Data Center and AI group fell 15% year-over-year to $4B, while Network and Edge revenue dropped 38% to $1.4B. Intel's nascent foundry unit saw a 307% surge in revenue to $232M.  The company also generated $454M in revenue attributed to Mobileye (MBLY), which it partially spun-off in October 2022.  A consensus of analysts expected  the company to lose 3 cents per share on $12.14B in revenue.  AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose in after-hours trading following the results.  Looking ahead, Intel (INTC) said it expects third-quarter revenue to be between $12.9B and $13.9B, with the mid-point above the $13.28B estimate.

I'm seeking to source ideas from the wisdom of the crowd. Following a Peter Lynch approach, I've been exploring niche or premium/luxury industries with 1-2 dominant players due to industry consolidation and brand loyalty. The fewer competitors, the better. Let me provide some examples:     * **Nvidia (Prior to AI/Crypto boom):** Before entering the spotlight, Nvidia was in a niche industry (GPUs for PC gaming) with little competition and selling products that could be considered in an enthusiast/premium-tier.  * **Garmin (GRMN):** Garmin holds a robust position in the niche sport watches segment, boasting around 40% market share (but facing fierce competition at the macro level). They offer premium products and enjoy significant brand loyalty. * **Shimano (7309):** I think in categories beyond entry-level: all the bicycle manufacturers/designers use Shimano and SRAM parts. Recently started in the hobby but I have the impression that having Shimano component could make-or-break a sale.   Other (not validated) ideas: OLED (as OLED technology it´s getting mainstream), CUERVO (Tequila industry), perhaps Herman Miller and Steelcase in the premium office chair segment?, Dolby (audio technology) and potentially Sonos in the future.

The broad index powered higher over the past few months, in large part because of a handful of companies posting outsize gains.  Many of those same stocks, including Amazon.com, Tesla and chip maker Nvidia, led the market’s advance Thursday.   That helped propel the S&P 500 up 0.6%, allowing the index to finish up 20% from its October low.  The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% to 33833.  Treasury yields retreated. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 3.714%, down from 3.782% Wednesday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.  Analysts attributed the relative calm to traders taking a wait-and-see attitude ahead of key events next week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release fresh data on inflation Tuesday, while the Federal Reserve will announce its latest interest-rate decision Wednesday.  So far, positioning in futures markets suggests many traders are betting the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged in June. That might offer markets some relief in the short-term, although investors warn that there could still be more policy-tightening ahead.   “A pause does not mean they are done with rate hikes,” said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors.   Traders are betting volatility could pick up in the coming months. The options contracts with the biggest positions tied to the Cboe Volatility Index, or Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” are wagers that it will surge to 30—a level associated with investor anxiety—or 60, a level only seen during stock-market crashes.  Among individual stocks, electric-car maker Tesla jumped 4.6% to $234.86, posting its 10th straight session of gains. That marked the company’s longest winning streak since an 11-session run that ended in January 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data.   Carvana, the online used car retailer, rose 56% to $24.23 after saying it expects its profit to jump in the second quarter.  GameStop plunged 18% to $21.44 after the videogame retailer fired its CEO, Matt Furlong, and appointed board member Ryan Cohen as its new executive chairman.   U.S. crude oil prices initially dropped after a report suggested U.S.-Iran talks on a temporary nuclear deal could allow the Islamic Republic to export more crude.

"Speculative Crap I'm Investing In So You Don't Have to";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b6k1qh/speculative_crap_im_investing_in_so_you_dont_have/";"Alright folks, mega caps and AI are all the rave but there's plenty of rather unknown companies which are growing their earning's at a tremendous rate. My portfolio in 2022 was Costco, Nvidia, Apple, Google and MSFT. They all did beautifully but they're too big for my liking now. Here's the speculative crap I'm investing in now  **1. GigaCloud Technology** \- Is like an Amazon or Alibaba but removes the consumer and does B2B ecommerce, no debt, strong cash flow, P/E ratio still reasonable for massive YoY growth. Already up a lot on this company and earning's coming up Q4 which expecting big beat.  **2.** **Vita-Coco** \- Everyone's all about Celsius or Monster, Coconut Water imo is the next best thing with a growing market, COCO, is the market leader. Summer's here, coming off winter lows and just had big beat in Q4 which normally worst quarter when its cold. Summer they partner with alcoholic brands and all the weight loss craze leads me to believe ppl are choosing healthy drink alternatives.  **3. Braze** \- Companies need a way to stay in touch with their customers, Braze creates a subscription model which handles all types of communication with customers and automates the process. This company is working its way towards becoming profitable. I was watching YT channel who interviews entrepreneurs, saw freelancer making $150k+ a year using the software to help companies so to me that's huge to see in the real world without even having looked for the company.  **4. Draft Kings** \- California and Texas still have not legalized online gambling which those two states alone are absolutely massive. Texas won't vote on it again until 2025, casino's in Oklahoma donate to Texan politicians to help influence keeping gambling out of the state but 2025 imo we see big changes. There's a huge catalyst here and earning's are growing with combat sports massively growing.  **5.** **Sofi -** The numbers don't lie. When rate cuts were plausibly announced we saw a massive jump. This company wants to run when rate cuts come but until then ppl really weary even though the numbers and guidance are phenomenal.  **6. Palantir** \- S&P500 inclusion didn't come after 5 quarters now of GAAP profitability, so in June imo we'll see it happen which is a huge catalyst. The earning's are growing as a we all know. I don't like the P/E ratio but this is a company I'd buy and immediately sell CC's on and keep selling CC""s until reaching my assigned price and repeating while holding long term.  Everyone of these companies imo has strong growing earning's, relatively unknown still compared to what everyone's piling into, and most have major catalysts coming up. COCO has summer, DK has legalization of massive states, Sofi has pending rate cuts, Palantir has sp500 inclusion, at least Braze and Giga about to report and beat as they do Q4 which should act as minor catalysts imo.";"536";"2024-03-04T20:40:23"
"Investment plan for about 85 000$ USD over the coming year";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1521ag1/investment_plan_for_about_85_000_usd_over_the/";"So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years.  I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030.  However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now.  I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices.  The plan:   \-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (**European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ** \- I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)   \-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of **Norwegian dividend stocks** (Done)   \-Buy shares in **AMD** for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)   \-Buy shares in **Alphabet** ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)   \-Buy shares sin **Tesla Corp** TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)   \-Buy shares in **TSMC** TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)   \-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to **bank account** I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time)  Some possible additions right now:   \-Considering Invesco **S&P 500 UCITS ETF** Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)   \-Considering Franklin FTSE **China UCITS ETF** FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)   \-Considering Franklin FTSE **India UCITS ETF** FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)   \-Considering **Apple** APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)   \-Considering **Microsoft** MSF, **Meta** FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)   \-Considering **Amazon** (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)   \-**Berkshire Hathaway Class B** BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)   \-Considering **Palantir** PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)   \-Considered **Nvidia** (FOMO)   \-Considered **IBM** and **Intel** as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)  So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?  Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)";"1";"2023-07-17T14:59:33"

"Intel stumbles as weak guidance, AI, foundry issues continue to weigh";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cd2202/intel_stumbles_as_weak_guidance_ai_foundry_issues/";"Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) significantly weaker-than-expected guidance for the coming quarter overshadowed better-than-expected first-quarter results.      For the coming second-quarter, the Pat Gelsinger-led firm expects revenue to be between $12.5B and $13.5B, well below the $13.61B analysts were anticipating.      It also anticipates earning an adjusted $0.10 per share with adjusted gross margins of 403.5% and a tax rate of 13%. Analysts were anticipating adjusted earnings of $0.25 per share.      Shares fell more than 6% in extended-hours trading.      For the period ending March 30, Intel earned an adjusted $0.18 per share on $12.7B in revenue. The quarter is Intel's first period in changing its reporting structure to focus more on its foundry business. Intel products, which now includes client computing, data center and network and edge, came in at $11.9B, including a 31% year-over-year rise in Client Computing revenue to $7.5B.      Datacenter and AI revenue came in at $3B, while revenue attributed to Mobileye (MBLY) was $239M, down 48% year-over-year. The Network and edge segment generated $1.4B, while the company's foundry segment saw revenue decline 10% year-over-tear to $4.4B.      Analysts expected a year-over-year increase in both the top and bottom lines, with the Pat Gelsinger-led firm expected to earn $0.14 per share on $12.78B in sales.      A consensus of analysts expected Intel to earn an adjusted $0.14 per share on $12.78B in revenue.      “Q1 revenue was in line with our expectations and we delivered non-GAAP EPS above our guidance, driven by better-than-expected gross margins and strong expense discipline,” Intel Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner said in a statement. ""Our new foundry operating model, which provides greater transparency and accountability, is already driving better decision-making across the business. Looking ahead, we expect to deliver year-over-year revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth in fiscal year 2024, including roughly 200 basis points of full-year gross margin improvement.”      Competitors AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) bucked the downturn and rose 1% and 2% in extended trading.

""Net-net, so while this might not be the home run that the Bulls might believe, the near-term opportunity to continue adding subscribers in North America seems very likely.

But he allows that there's some squishiness in those findings since it's possible that some survey respondents might not be fully aware they are in violation of Netflix's new rules. Among the group that currently shares a subscription and has not yet lost access to a shared account, 22% either plan to get their own subscription or have already done so.

Dell Technologies Inc. DELL, +8.56% was a hot company around the turn of the century, as it leapt ahead in the fast-moving race to sell personal computers. The company became the top-selling computer-systems provider globally in 2001.  The brand lost some of its cachet as the years went on, and as Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.48% began to see more traction in the personal-computer market. But Dell seems cool again in the artificial-intelligence era, and investors are taking notice.  The stock closed up 8.6% in Wednesday trading to hit $128.58. That marked a new all-time closing high for the shares, their first in about a month.

Wall Street has a new appreciation for Dell thanks to the company’s position as a backbone of the AI revolution. The shares enjoyed their best day on record in early March, as the company showed rapid shipment growth for its AI-optimized servers. AI-hardware titan Nvidia Corp.

"Amazon spends $2.75B on AI startup Anthropic, its largest venture investment";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bp6rv9/amazon_spends_275b_on_ai_startup_anthropic_its/";"Amazon is making its largest outside investment in its three-decade history as it looks to gain an edge in the artificial intelligence race.   The tech giant said it will spend another $2.75 billion backing Anthropic, a San Francisco-based startup that’s widely viewed as a frontrunner in generative artificial intelligence. Its foundation model and chatbot Claude competes with OpenAI and ChatGPT.  The companies announced an initial $1.25 billion investment in September, and said at the time that Amazon would invest up to $4 billion. Wednesday’s news marks Amazon’s second tranche of that funding.  Amazon will maintain a minority stake in the company and won’t have an Anthropic board seat, the company said. The deal was struck at the AI startup’s last valuation, which was $18.4 billion, according to a source.   Over the past year, Anthropic closed five different funding deals worth about $7.3 billion — and with the new Amazon investment, the total exceeds $10 billion. The company’s product directly competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT in both the enterprise and consumer worlds, and it was founded by ex-OpenAI research executives and employees.  News of the Amazon investment comes weeks after Anthropic debuted Claude 3, its newest suite of AI models that it says are its fastest and most powerful yet. The company said the most capable of its new models outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini Ultra on industry benchmark tests, such as undergraduate level knowledge, graduate level reasoning and basic mathematics.  “Generative AI is poised to be the most transformational technology of our time, and we believe our strategic collaboration with Anthropic will further improve our customers’ experiences, and look forward to what’s next,” said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of data and AI at AWS.  Amazon’s move is the latest in a spending blitz among cloud providers to stay ahead in the AI race. And it’s the second update in a week to Anthropic’s capital structure. Late Friday, bankruptcy filings showed crypto exchange FTX struck a deal with a group of buyers to sell the majority of its stake in Anthropic, confirming a CNBC report from last week.  The term generative AI entered the mainstream and business vernacular seemingly overnight, and the field has exploded over the past year, with a record $29.1 billion invested across nearly 700 deals in 2023, according to PitchBook. OpenAI’s ChatGPT first showcased the tech’s ability to produce human-like language and creative content in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has said more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted the platform, spanning industries such as financial services, legal applications and education.  Cloud providers like Amazon Web Services don’t want to be caught flat-footed.  It’s a symbiotic relationship. As part of the agreement, Anthropic said it will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. It will also use Amazon chips to train, build and deploy its foundation models. Amazon has been designing its own chips that may eventually compete with Nvidia.   Microsoft has been on its own spending spree with a high-profile investment into OpenAI. Microsoft’s OpenAI bet has reportedly jumped to $13 billion as the startup’s valuation has topped $29 billion. Microsoft’s Azure is also OpenAI’s exclusive provider for computing power, which means the startup’s success and new business flows back to Microsoft’s cloud servers.  Google, meanwhile, has also backed Anthropic, with its own deal for Google Cloud. It agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic, comprising a $500 million cash infusion, with another $1.5 billion to be invested over time. Salesforce is also a backer.  Anthropic’s new model suite, announced earlier this month, marks the first time the company has offered “multimodality,” or adding options like photo and video capabilities to generative AI.  But multimodality, and increasingly complex AI models, also lead to more potential risks. Google recently took its AI image generator, part of its Gemini chatbot, offline after users discovered historical inaccuracies and questionable responses, which circulated widely on social media.  Anthropic’s Claude 3 does not generate images: instead, it only allows users to upload images and other documents for analysis.  “Of course no model is perfect, and I think that’s a very important thing to say upfront,” Anthropic co-founder Daniela Amodei told CNBC earlier this month. “We’ve tried very diligently to make these models the intersection of as capable and as safe as possible. Of course there are going to be places where the model still makes something up from time to time.”  Amazon’s biggest venture bet before Anthropic was electric vehicle maker Rivian, where it invested more than $1.3 billion. That too, was a strategic partnership.   These partnerships have been picking up in the face of more antitrust scrutiny. A drop in acquisitions by the Magnificent Seven — Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla — has been offset by an increase in venture-style investing, according to Pitchbook.  AI and machine-learning investments from those seven tech companies jumped to $24.6 billion last year, up from $4.4 billion in 2022, according to Pitchbook. At the same time, Big Tech’s M&A deals fell from 40 deals in 2022 to 13 last year.   “There is a sort of paranoia motivation to invest in potential disruptors,” Pitchbook AI analyst, Brendan Burke, said in an interview. “The other motivation is to increase sales, and to invest in companies that are likely to use the other company’s product — they tend to be partners, more so than competitors.”  Big Tech’s spending spree in AI has come under fire for the seemingly circular nature of these agreements. By investing in AI startups, some, including Benchmark’s Bill Gurley have accused the tech giants of funneling cash back to their cloud businesses, which in turn, may show up as revenue. Gurley described it as a way to “goose your own revenues.”  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is taking a closer look at these partnerships, including Microsoft’s OpenAI deal and Google and Amazon’s Anthropic investments. What’s sometimes called “round tripping” can be illegal — especially if the aim is to mislead investors. But Amazon has said that this type of venture investing does not constitute round tripping.  FTC Chair Lina Khan announced the inquiry during the agency’s tech summit on AI, describing it as a “market inquiry into the investments and partnerships being formed between AI developers and major cloud service providers.”  Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/27/amazon-spends-2point7b-on-startup-anthropic-in-largest-venture-investment.html";"634";"2024-03-27T17:54:55"

"4 Tech stocks benefiting from the AI boom.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14ezyqm/4_tech_stocks_benefiting_from_the_ai_boom/";"The world of artificial intelligence (AI) these days is overwhelmingly dominated by discussions on generative AI and its implications. Simply put, generative AI is a form of machine learning through which AI software can produce text, video, images, and more. Basically, generative AI can produce any form of content on the basis of prompts. This form of AI became more widespread and renowned after the launch of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms, which revolutionized the AI sector while pulling in major tech companies to become part of the AI race.      This form of AI and its impact on the markets was discussed by Jim Stewart, a New York Times columnist, on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' on June 16. According to Stewart, big tech companies, especially those that are AI beneficiaries, have been leading the recent stock market rally. These include companies such as Microsoft Corporation ($MSFT), Alphabet Inc. ($GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA). Stewart claimed that he was bullish on AI, especially considering the fact that this technology could boost productivity gains across different fields, including journalism.      **AI and the US Stock Market**   In May, NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) joined the group of companies with valuations in trillions of dollars. Many financial professionals today are attributing the gains of the S&P 500 to AI, primarily, with the focus being on NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) and other big tech companies that have begun incorporating AI and generative AI in their products and services.      This overwhelming focus on a select few number of companies that can successfully play the AI boom and come out victorious has led to many investors worrying that the stock market in 2023 will turn into a selection of a few winners and a lot more losers. The S&P 500 has ""basically been the S&P 7,"" a reference to the fact that only seven major tech companies have been calling the shots so far in 2023, leading the market to heavily rely on them and their gains.      **""You Are At The Starting Line Of AI""**   This reality has led many professionals and corporations to realize that the AI boom is very real and may be here to stay. Companies today will be bound to figure out where they stand in this environment and how they can integrate AI into their business models to reap the benefits of this technological revolution. NVIDIA Corporation's ($NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, in an address at the National Taiwan University in May, stated that we are currently at ""the starting line of AI"" and that at this moment, we should run instead of walking. The implications of his statement are many, but perhaps the most obvious lesson to take away from Huang's speech is that companies and individuals today shouldn't be slow to join the AI race - they should try their best to become part of it and ensure they don't end up getting left behind by their competitors.      Keeping the above-mentioned market dynamics and developments in mind, I have compiled a list of the top tech stocks to consider investing in to play the AI boom. I included the obvious stock picks because of their contributions to this industry so far, but I also attempted to find other companies that wouldn't be the first to come to your mind when looking at AI beneficiaries today.   # Our Methodology  To select our stocks, I  looked at which companies analysts are expecting to benefit from the AI boom and shortlisted them based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter of 2023. The stocks are ranked based on this metric, from the lowest to the highest number of hedge funds long each of them.  # Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom     **1. Oracle Corporation ($ORCL)**      On June 13, Keith Bachman at BMO Capital raised his price target on Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) from $96 to $132. The analyst also holds a Market Perform rating on the stock.      Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) is an information technology company based in Austin, Texas. The company's products and services address enterprise information technology environments across the world.      I saw 67 hedge funds long Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $2.9 billion.      TD Cowen's John Blackledge expects Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) to benefit from the current AI boom because its cloud-computing platform can offer it some competitive advantages.      First Eagle Investment Management held 20.7 million shares in Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) at the end of the first quarter, making it the largest shareholder in the company.  **2. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD)**      CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) is an information technology company offering cybersecurity products and services. It is based in Austin, Texas.      There were 72 hedge funds holding stakes in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) at the end of the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $2.4 billion.      CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) may be an interesting stock pick to play the AI boom considering the company has recently announced new AI-powered indicators of attack (IoA) models. These models can combat advanced adversary tradecraft by using machine intelligence to stop breaches.      Tal Liani at Bank of America holds a Buy rating on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) shares as of June 16. The analyst also raised the firm's price target on the stock from $162 to $190.  **3. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD)**      Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) was spotted in the portfolios of 91 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $4.9 billion.      Based in Santa Clara, California, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) is a semiconductor company that operates globally.      Joseph Moore, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, raised his price target on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) shares on June 16 from $97 to $138. The analyst also holds an Overweight rating on the shares.      Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) is a chipmaker that TD Cowen's John Blackledge has picked as one of his tech stocks to play the AI boom. This is unsurprising considering the fact that this June, the company revealed its new AI chip in its race with NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA). The new MI300X chip was described by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) as ""the world's most advances accelerator for generative AI.""      Citadel Investment Group held 13.9 million shares in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) at the end of the first quarter, making the fund the most prominent shareholder in the company for that quarter.  **4. Adobe Inc. ($ADBE)**      Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) is a diversified software and information technology company based in San Jose, California. The company's flagship product is its Creative Cloud, a subscription service offering members access to its creative products.      John Blackledge at TD Cowen sees Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) as a smart AI play because the company has begun rolling out new generative-AI content creation tools.      An Outperform rating was reiterated on Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) shares on June 16 by Kirk Materne at Evercore ISI. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $475 to $590.      A total of 99 hedge funds were long Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $7.3 billion.  **4. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)**      Apple Inc. ($AAPL) may not be the first big tech company that comes to your mind when looking for AI plays, but with the company's new Vision Pro headset, some believe it may be getting involved in the machine learning space more than before.      Analysts at Bernstein hold a Market Perform rating and a $175 price target on Apple Inc. ($AAPL) shares as of June 14.      Our hedge fund data for the first quarter shows 131 hedge funds long Apple Inc. ($AAPL). Their total stake value was $165 billion.      Holding 915.6 million shares in the company, Berkshire Hathaway was the largest stakeholder in Apple Inc. ($AAPL) at the end of the first quarter.";"6";"2023-06-21T08:45:44"
"ATH | Leverage | Index Funds and more";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17p3jmo/ath_leverage_index_funds_and_more/";"I got a few questions as a newbie  &#x200B:  1. Some of the companies I want to invest long-term are either at their ATH or close to ATH, like Microsoft  or Nvidia. I'm wondering whether I should wait for it to drop, because most of the stock market is green this year, so I have a feeling it may drop since it grew so much, what do you think? Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy 2. Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? 3. Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow?  4. Stock Math  - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back? Logically the first answer, but something doesn't give me a peace of mind here, so I prefer to ask 5. Eli Lilly - what do you think about this stock? Growed massive amount lately, and pharmaceutical industry will definitely be there in 5 or 10 years.";"1";"2023-11-06T15:09:30"
"I may be stupid...";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17hd9f2/i_may_be_stupid/";"but I was just wondering why people don't just hold shares of a company for 5 to 10 minutes, and trade when they earn a 2% profit.   If someone with 100 dollars do that 1 time a day, in a year, they would earn 137000 dollars.  Now, I understand that it is extremely difficult to do that perfectly, because stocks would rise and fall. But some shares are really volatile, so....  Actually, I don't know what I'm saying or doing. I just thought of it last night and thought it would be interesting if someone could do that.  Edit: So after I read many of the Redditor's comments, I realized I left out a key piece: doing it on a large scale. So  one would invest in many different company's stocks. Once a share price drops, they would sell it at minimal losses. But with so many stocks, there is a good chance at least one would rise, so they could sell it at a higher price and potentially earn a profit.  Thanks to you all as well! I do not trade stocks at all and I do not know much at all about them. I was just wondering about that and this was the first place I thought to ask.";"0";"2023-10-27T04:23:02"

I’m 28 years old female. I don’t want to worry about not having enough for retirement so I started to research the investment community.   After some weeks of researching, I finally decided to give it a try and this is how I started and my investment plan:   I started this week with 500$ USD, on Reddit I read to start small, and not to jump with all your savings straight away, so that’s what I’m trying to do.   The only advice I decided not uto follow (for now) is to invest on ETFs. That’s because lately (or at least during the time I’ve been paying attention to them) most I’ve them have been doing quite badly these last 3 months. So I decided to wait until I see some improvement.   For now, I divided those 500$ and invested 200 of then on (NVO) Novo Nordisk. After some research I noticed that healthcare is doing extremely good recently compared with tech, (at last for these last 3 months).   So yes, 200$ went to NVO, which seems to be growing quite well.   Then, I did some research on Penny stocks, so I have other 200$ divided in between 4- 5 penny stocks companies that have been exponentially growing lately. For example, everyday I read the news about these type of companies and if one of them made some type of advance on their field, I’ll invest between 10$ to 50$ USD on it, let it grow for 3 to 5 days then sell the stocks that I gain from it.   Maybe 10$ USD investment doesn’t sound like a lot, but I feel is the safest option for a stocks baby like me. And sometimes these companies have a 1000% weekly grow in a week, so those 10 become 100 or those 50$ become 500$. Then with the extra money I made, I divided it and half of it goes to a place where I consider is safe to invest for the long run like NVO and the other half goes to penny stocks. And I small percentage stays on my account for me to have it there chilling.   Do you think my investment approach is a good one? Do you have any advices?  Thank you so much.";"0";"2023-10-18T13:00:46"
"TECH China’s new guidelines block Intel and AMD chips in government computers: FT";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bnepfo/tech_chinas_new_guidelines_block_intel_and_amd/";"China has rolled out new guidelines that will phase out U.S. processors in government computers and servers, effectively blocking chips from Inteland AMD, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.  The procurement guidelines, unveiled on Dec. 26, are now being enforced and will also impact Microsoft’s Windows operating system and foreign-made database software as they favor Chinese alternatives, the report said. Government agencies higher the township level have been ordered to purchase “safe and reliable” processors and operating systems, FT said. AMD and Intel declined to comment on the report.   This comes as China has been boosting its domestic semiconductor industry as it seeks to reduce reliance on foreign technology. Semiconductors – critical components found in a wide range of devices from smartphones to medical equipment – have been at the center of a technology war between the U.S. and China.  U.S. has implemented export restrictions to cut off Beijing from key semiconductor equipment and technologies. In October 2022, Washington introduced rules aimed at restricting China’s ability to access, obtain or manufacture advanced semiconductor chips amid concerns that China could use them for military purposes. The U.S. then rolled out new regulations in October 2023 to prevent U.S. chip design firm Nvidia from selling advanced AI chips to China.   Since 2019, Chinese tech companies such as Huawei and China’s biggest chipmaker SMIC have been slapped with sanctions by the U.S. aimed at restricting their access to advanced technology. SMIC has also been unable to obtain extreme ultraviolet lithography machines critical for the making of advanced chips from firm ASML. The U.S.-led tech embargo has helped boost revenues at China’s domestic chip equipment manufacturing firms. China’s top 10 equipment makers reported revenue rose 39% in the first half of 2023 as compared to a year ago, according to Shanghai-based CINNO Research.

It is to decide if, notwithstanding these current circumstances, the merger should be halted—perhaps even terminated—pending resolution of the FTC administrative action,” Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley wrote in her decision, published on Tuesday. “For the reasons explained, the Court finds the FTC has not shown a likelihood it will prevail on its claim this particular vertical merger in this specific industry may substantially lessen competition. To the contrary, the record evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content. The motion for a preliminary injunction is therefore DENIED.”      The decision comes after five days of court hearings to assess whether Microsoft    would be able to complete the $68.7 billion Activision Blizzard    acquisition it announced in 2022. The judge was deciding whether to grant the FTC’s request for an emergency injunction to prevent the deal from closing.      The FTC argued Microsoft has shown an interest in making some games exclusive, to prevent them from appearing on Sony’s PlayStation or Nintendo’s Switch, and might do that if the deal were to close, while Microsoft said they would want to make Activision’s title more available, not less, partly to grow from people subscribing to its Game Pass library of games. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick both testified, as did executives from Alphabet, Nvidia and Sony.      In December the Federal Trade Commission filed suit to block the deal and have an administrative law judge at the agency assess it. But in June, before that could happen, the FTC requested a preliminary injunction to prevent Microsoft from completing the acquisition, with an eye toward bringing the case to its administrative law judge on Aug. 2. The two companies were looking to close the deal by July 18.      Kotick said during the hearings that the Activision Blizzard board didn’t see how the deal could continue if the judge were to grant the preliminary injunction.";"139";"2023-07-11T17:10:02"

My focus is on identifying stocks that have the capacity to shape and embody this vision. Initially, I invested in AMD back in 2016, primarily because it was more affordable compared to Intel, and I happened to get lucky. In 2018, I added NVIDIA to my portfolio as I had a deep interest in gaming and GPU/computer building. In 2020, I purchased an Oculus device, which allowed me to glimpse into an untapped future. Interestingly, Facebook, now META, has emerged as a dominant player in this space. It's possible that they will enjoy several years of success, much like Intel did in 2016.      Recently, I discovered Roblox, a company that shares my vision and embodies how I envision the true metaverse operating. They have a long road ahead, but with the right talent within the company, they have the potential to achieve their goals. Patience will be crucial since the key lies in retaining their user base into adulthood rather than solely targeting adults at present. This journey will undoubtedly take years. Furthermore, their success is reliant on partnerships with NVIDIA and other hardware manufacturers who can provide the necessary technology. I believe Roblox could be the interface we rely on as AI progresses and 3D/VR technology becomes more advanced.      Considering all this, I seek advice on whether to invest in this company now or wait for future developments, especially if I anticipate Roblox to resemble the fictional 'Innovative Online Industries' from the book Ready Player One. While there seems to be a collective vision for the future, the uncertainty lies in identifying the company that can bring it to life.

I realised that I am never receiveing any AGM notices from these companies. How do you register yourself as a shareholder to attend and vote at an AGM of, for example, Nvidia?   Do companies send such notices through the various brokers or do you first need to specifically sign up on their website to receive them?  &#x200B:";"4";"2023-08-10T14:55:03"
"Foreign Investors Sold $9.8B of Chinese Stocks this Month";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1602ggg/foreign_investors_sold_98b_of_chinese_stocks_this/";"[https://tokenist.com/foreign-investors-sold-9-8b-of-chinese-stocks-this-month/](https://tokenist.com/foreign-investors-sold-9-8b-of-chinese-stocks-this-month/)     In August 2023, foreign investors set a new record by divesting $9.8 billion in Chinese stocks, driven by escalating concerns over China's crumbling property market. This historic monthly sell-off highlights the crisis's impact on the local stock market, with offloaded stocks totaling 71.6 billion yuan ($9.8 billion), the highest since the mainland-Hong Kong stock trading link began in 2014.      Despite mainland institutional investors expressing interest in Chinese stocks, the market continues to struggle. While foreign investors hold under 10% of A-shares by market cap, their preference for top-weighted stocks in the CSI 300 index grants them substantial influence. Although the index increased 0.72% to 3,723, it remains down over 7% since July.      Rooted in China's property turmoil, responsible for a quarter of its economy, the sell-off follows Evergrande's bankruptcy protection filing due to a colossal debt exceeding $300 billion. As the property and broader economic concerns meld, experts caution that factors like tight loan conditions and muted consumer spending amplify the risk of an impending global recession.";"117";"2023-08-24T15:48:00"
"Morgan Stanley Sees Dojo Boosting TSLA Value by $500 Billion";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16g2nth/morgan_stanley_sees_dojo_boosting_tsla_value_by/";"Headline comes from Bloomberg [(yahoo link)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-surge-thanks-dojo-supercomputer-032644640.html)  TSLA is up nearly 10% today.  Morgan Stanley's upgrade of TSLA was a target of $400, up from $250.  Excerpt from the article:  > Tesla has been mentioning how Dojo gives it an edge in AI and self-driving technology since at least 2021. In July this year, CEO Elon Musk told investors that the carmaker plans to invest more than $1 billion on the project by the end of 2024.  > “As a point of reference, in 2022, Nvidia spent $7 billion across the entire company on research and development,” Gene Munster, co-founder and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, wrote in a note in July. “In other words, spending $1 billion plus on a single product is aggressive and speaks to Musk’s urgency at making good on this FSD prediction.”  > Seth Goldstein of Morningstar Research Services LLC says that, “while it’s good for Elon to push the team to go as quickly as possible, in reality Tesla usually sees a delay from Elon’s original timelines.”  > “It doesn’t mean they aren’t making progress,” Goldstein said in a phone interview Monday. “Once Dojo is up and running and takes over the software training, it will allow Tesla to update software more quickly and increase subscriptions at software margins, which can be a big value driver.”";"66";"2023-09-11T20:14:43"
"$INTC is a very undervalued AI play.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13xhk0k/intc_is_a_very_undervalued_ai_play/";"   If you feel you missed the AI train, don’t worry. Intel is a   great value at its current price and a hidden gem in plain sight as NVDA gets   the spotlight.    I think its ultimately going to come down to INTC/NVDA vs   AMD   1.NVDA CEO Jensen Huang recently came out and said Intel   Chips “look good”. This is added competition for TSM and a big advantage for   INTC.  Most TSM processing and   fabrication plants are in Taiwan. Most of INTC’s fabricating plants are in the   US and friendly countries. The number one reason Buffett dumped TSM is   location, location, Location.    https://www.barrons.com/articles/intel-tsmc-nvidia-573267ea   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Intel\_manufacturing\_sites   2. INTC is a huge benefactor of the CHIPS ACT.    3. INTC also makes GPU’s competitive with NVDA. https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/discrete-gpus/arc.html   I don’t think NVDA will buy INTC as its too expensive and   they won’t merge because shareholders wont allow it but they will compliment   and benefit from each other’s success in the new world of AI.

"What’s the future of Apple?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b7d0v8/whats_the_future_of_apple/";"The world is going into the AI era, and I just don’t see Apple in it.  It seems iPhone is close to its fullest potential, they are throwing the same phone out for many years now, and people are much less hyped about it. While back then, it was worth it to get the new one every year for the upgrades, now new iPhones are just A(n+1) processor, new colors, and a bit better camera. They look the same too, so it has lost its “status symbol” attribute too. I don’t see it changing soon. Pretty much same with iPads. Apple Watch is like.. it’s a watch, they can improve on it, but I don’t see people sitting on needles waiting when the new one will come out. They can improve battery life, make it brighter every year as the sun, make it do something with every sort of sign language hand movements (why though?) but that’s it. Macs aren’t going to save them either, they are faster for sure, but there’s not a huge market for them, or in other words, no massive growth is expected. There’s potential in VR, but in my opinion VR is very very far from being able to be an everyday wearable, and it’s for sure they won’t be the ones developing VR to that point. Why? Well, that’s my main point. Apple has never been an innovator, they were always the last to adapt something, and only when they were able to “perfect it” (even though they have massively failed many times). I’m just afraid they aren’t good positioned for either promising areas: AI, and VR. My theory is they will be afraid of AI, because it’s something that’s much harder to control, and perfect. I don’t see how Apple, being a control freak, would be able to live with something that’s not predictable. For VR, I think they will wait until they will be way late from the game. They will come out with something that’s 5 years behind, but I’m not sure they will be able to get away with it (as they were able to do with iPhones - which I cannot understand how they did till this day). They also don’t have a shovel in the AI gold rush as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia do. I’m genuinely worried about the future of Apple, and seems like they can be the next Nokia. Just to clarify, I’m not anti Apple, I’m the one who buys all the crap they throw out (iPhone, watch, beats, Mac, iPad), that’s why I see they are getting less and less exciting.

"I am a cynical pessimist. How do I ever get to buy a hype?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1amih26/i_am_a_cynical_pessimist_how_do_i_ever_get_to_buy/";"The thing is: I am somewhat knowledgeable in the IT / AI field and chose that field as my investment ""playground"". When looking at trends, I tend to have a cynical, pessimistic outlook which, on a technical level, has generally proven to be correct in the past. However, the stock market ignores all this nice technical expertise and trades unfounded expectations and hype -- and I never buy into the hype and look at all those green numbers on my watchlist only.  Some examples: I looked at NVIDIA when the crypto mining hype was on, with a background in high performance computing, and figured their GPUs were not energy efficient enough and this was quite obviously a task for ASICs, which proved correct in hindsight. I decided to stay out of what I considered an unfounded hype -- and missed out on the first big jump.   I also looked at AI and big data-based predictive analysis and maintenance, back before the \*GPT hype, and with connections to high energy physicists who run serious big data analyses decided that that was not a good fit for typical industry data. Almost no one apart from perhaps the big cloud operators has enough raw data in their enterprise to do meaningful statistical analyses. From what I hear, this is also technically correct as many companies silently ditch their hopes to be able to do predictive maintenance now -- but I obviously missed out on that hype as well.  Can you give me some advice on adjusting my way of looking at the market? I find ""don't worry about the technical realities, the finance people won't understand anyway and just buy the shiny new stuff"" a bit too simplistic and cynical...

"AI Madness and profitablity";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b74mw7/ai_madness_and_profitablity/";"This isn't a post about AI bubble or why the chip and cloud hardware supplier is on a nutty uptrend. Their revenue in cases like NVDA has grew 120%+ YoY with insane profit margin, and since market is short sighted, it makes sense why the insane run. Lot of people kicking themselves for not see this coming, or someone like me who saw it coming but exited earlier because couldn’t value the “shovel” correctly in this gold rush.    Now lets take a step back and look at this trend from a different angle. Main buyers are the big 5 Google, OpenAI, META, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT (GOMAM).   In order for your you all to understand my next points we all first have to agree on few basic things   **1). Companies have FINITE capex amount**   **2). Every company at the end of the day WANTS to make money**   **3). Every company wants to find a way to REDUCE their capex and still grow**   For point #2, the way these company will eventually make money is by selling the products to consumer and business. So in next 5-10 years we will see leap in software and services innovations. We will see so many new small and midsize companies using these applications to build more complex solutions on cloud. Now take your guess who will benefit the most from this? if your answer is GOMAM, thats correct. If your answer is NVDA then you are an idiot.    I would say point #1 and point #3 go hand in hand, we are seeing lot of capex diverted within the company itself. So to no surprise, GOMAM are already building and some have built their own silicon. Its just matter of time when they start to reduce their exposure to external company. This isn’t to say that NVDA will ever become irrelevant. The point is they will always have to outgrow and justify for GOMAM to spend their capex on them. This is the bet you are making for going LONG nvidia at these valuation. Because again, market is short sighted, they are seeing 6-12 month guidance and pumping.   Now i am seeing crazy amount of doom and gloom for companies like AAPL and GOOG lately on reddit and also on media. I just have one question, that goes to #2. How do you guys think every software and services that will leverage these new silicon will reach the end users? Think for a second form a consumer standpoint. They don’t know wtf is NVDA, AMD. All they know is smartphones, tablets, wearable, laptops. I am not saying where you should invest your money. I am just saying don’t go with the trend like a madman. if you miss the shovel rush, you can still make plenty of money on factories that will make gold products for end users.    **in summary,**    **I see there is more value in going long on GOMAAM (Added AAPL) than NVDA,AMD**";"95";"2024-03-05T14:00:28"

Meanwhile, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid after Fitch Ratings placed the United States’ AAA rating on a negative rating watch. ***** > S&P 500 futures were up 0.6%, while Nasdaq-100 futures popped 1.9%. Dow futures were down 85 points, or 0.3%. ***** > Nvidia shares surged 27% in the premarket trading after the artificial intelligence beneficiary gave stronger-than-expected revenue guidance for its fiscal second quarter, while also reporting beats on the top and bottom line in the previous quarter. Several analysts covering the stock hiked their price targets on the stock following the results. ***** > Other semiconductor stocks followed Nvidia higher, including AMD and Taiwan Semiconductor, which rose 6.4% and 9.7%, respectively. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) popped 6.2%. ***** > Meanwhile, Fitch Ratings put the U.S.′ AAA long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating on a negative watch.

"Micron Q4 Earnings: Beats Estimates, but Poor Guidance Drags Stock Price";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16ugf0n/micron_q4_earnings_beats_estimates_but_poor/";"[https://tokenist.com/micron-q4-earnings-beats-estimates-but-poor-guidance-drags-stock-price/](https://tokenist.com/micron-q4-earnings-beats-estimates-but-poor-guidance-drags-stock-price/)  Micron reported Q4 2023 earnings and revenue, surpassing analysts’ expectations: however, its shares fell by 4.6% due to a less optimistic outlook amid ongoing supply constraints. While Micron posted an adjusted loss narrower than expected at $1.07 per share, and revenue of $4.01 billion exceeding the expected $3.93 billion, it was significantly down from $6.65 billion year-over-year.      Gross margins also plunged due to a nearly 40% decline in revenue from waning demand. Micron anticipates continued losses and is working to supply high-bandwidth chips to Nvidia, hoping to leverage the rising demand in AI, expecting this collaboration to bring in ""several hundred million"" dollars in revenue in 2024. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra remains optimistic about market recovery in 2024 and foresees record industry revenue in 2025.";"15";"2023-09-28T15:42:02"
