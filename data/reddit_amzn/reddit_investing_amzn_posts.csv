"Amazon has replaced Walgreens in the Dow Jones Industrial Index.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b0tdch/amazon_has_replaced_walgreens_in_the_dow_jones/";"[https://apnews.com/article/amazon-walgreens-dow-jones-industrial-average-stock-market-7e7d5e71ee10f7612a45ac1c8bb82c4e](https://apnews.com/article/amazon-walgreens-dow-jones-industrial-average-stock-market-7e7d5e71ee10f7612a45ac1c8bb82c4e)  Supposedly, the motivation was to replace a retail company with another retail company, but everyone knows most of Amazon‘s market value comes from its extremely lucrative web hosting business.  I‘m not sure how I feel about this. Before today, the Dow was the last of the 3 major U.S. large-cap indices with less (relatively speaking) concentration in tech. “Big Tech” now makes up 30% of the S&P 500 and even more of the NASDAQ-100.  The Dow Jones now includes 3 of the 6 companies (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon) usually considered as Big Tech, plus cloud software provider Salesforce, as well as 3 legacy tech companies (IBM, Intel, Cisco.) That‘s a lot of exposure to tech.  Relatively few 401k providers offer alternatives such as S&P 500 equally-weighted ETFs.";"225";"2024-02-26T22:29:18"

Said coworker has 8 grand of credit card debt with an interest rate of 25% and a minimum payment of around 500 per month.

"Nvidia’s sheer dominance can be summed up by this one underrated number";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awyoh4/nvidias_sheer_dominance_can_be_summed_up_by_this/";"My other Nvidia post got a lot of traction, so I thought I’d continue the Nvidia party. there’s been a lot of talk comparing them to Cisco back in the .com era.   I lived through .com era and it was vastly different. If you said you were an online mall, you could get $1 billion the next day. Because people understood malls and this Internet thing was going to raise all roofs.   Pets.com? I know what a pet is..com makes it even better!  I remember the exact street I was driving on when the one trillionth radio advertisement for Amazon came on the radio. And I was like, what a stupid name for a bookstore. Amazon has nothing to do with books. And for years and years and years, Amazon, lost money. They only existed because that.com Bubble had lifted them so far they had Cash. Lotsa cash. But they were a joke for about a decade.  But the real big thing was almost none of those companies had a profit. They didn’t make any money whatsoever. None. No business. They were burning through cash with expensive offices, expensive staff, oh man, salaries for tech workers were astronomical.  The companies that did have a profit, we’re making pennies. Or there profit margins were incredibly slim. There were only handfuls of companies that were catapulted by the bubble that didn’t meet this criteria.  Cisco was in a similar situation to Nvidia. Cisco built the tools that would enable this tremendous new technology. but their net profit margin was like 17%. Vastly less than nvidias. Nvidia forward p/e is 54. Ciscos was 150.  If it’s a bubble, it’s nowhere near the size of the.com bubble. S&P 500 is P/E of 22. In 2000 it was 28.

"AMZN Earnings Report Q2 2023";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15hkg9d/amzn_earnings_report_q2_2023/";"\*\* I'm for whatever reason, enjoying going through the documents and attempting to make it easier to digest and read. I just started doing this so any feedback would be appreciated. Goal is for a quick overview of the earnings report for an average person to be able to read and digest\*\*  1. Operating Activities:   The operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows showcases how Amazon generates cash from its core business operations. In both periods, the company's operating activities generated positive cash flow. There was a significant increase in net income, showing growth from a loss of $2.03 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. This highlights a remarkable improvement in Amazon's financial performance and operational efficiency.      2. Investing Activities:   Amazon invested heavily in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions during the analyzed periods. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, the company's investments in property and equipment amounted to $15.72 billion, which decreased to $11.45 billion in the same period in 2023. While the absolute values decreased, these investments are essential for the company's long-term growth and expansion.      3. Financing Activities:   The financing activities section details Amazon's capital structure and shareholder returns. The company engaged in various financing activities, including repurchasing common stock, resulting in cash outflows of $3.33 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2023, and $6 billion in the six months ending June 30, 2022. Additionally, the company obtained proceeds from short-term debt and other financing, contributing $4.87 billion and $4.4 billion in the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. Investors should be aware of these activities, as they impact the company's capital allocation strategy.      4. Cash Position:   Amazon maintained a strong cash position, reflecting its financial stability and liquidity. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased steadily over the periods, reaching $50.07 billion at the end of the twelve months ending June 30, 2023. This signifies the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations and pursue growth opportunities.      5. Debt and Interest Payments:   The company managed its debt obligations efficiently, making principal repayments on long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations. Amazon also paid interest on debt, with cash outflows totaling $349 million and $954 million for the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. These payments demonstrate responsible debt management and the company's commitment to meeting its financial obligations.      6. Net Sales:   Net sales are a fundamental indicator of Amazon's revenue growth and market performance. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, net sales reached $121.23 billion, which increased to $134.38 billion in the same period in 2023, representing an 11% year-over-year growth. Similarly, for the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net sales grew from $237.68 billion to $261.74 billion, showing strong and consistent revenue growth.      7. Operating Expenses:   Operating expenses provide insights into the company's cost structure and efficiency. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, operating expenses were $117.92 billion, which increased to $126.70 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating expenses increased from $230.69 billion to $249.29 billion, primarily due to higher fulfillment, technology, and infrastructure costs. Despite the increase, Amazon's revenue growth outpaced the rise in operating expenses, leading to improved operating income.      8. Operating Income:   Operating income measures the profitability of Amazon's core operations. The company experienced significant growth in operating income, increasing from $3.32 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to $7.68 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating income rose from $6.99 billion to $12.46 billion, indicating improved operational efficiency and profitability.      9. Non-Operating Expense:   The non-operating expense provides insights into Amazon's other income and expenses outside its core operations. Total non-operating expense decreased from ($5.97) billion to ($0.12) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. This decline was primarily due to a positive swing in other income (expense), net, indicating favorable financial management.      10. Net Income (Loss):   Net income is a critical metric that assesses Amazon's overall financial performance. The company experienced a significant improvement in net income, increasing from a loss of ($2.03) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net income increased from a loss of ($5.87) billion to a profit of $9.92 billion, demonstrating a strong financial turnaround.      11. Earnings Per Share (EPS):   Earnings per share is a vital metric for shareholders, as it represents the company's profitability on a per-share basis. Basic earnings per share increased from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.66 for the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. Diluted earnings per share showed similar growth, rising from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.65 for the same periods.      12. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss):   Other comprehensive income (loss) includes items that impact the company's financial position but are not part of the net income calculation. For the three months ending June 30, 2022, Amazon's other comprehensive income was ($2.42) billion, which increased to $293 million for the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, other comprehensive income was ($3.41) billion and $807 million, respectively.      13.

In the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, all segments showed significant growth in net sales.      •	North America: Net sales in North America increased from $80.85 billion to $87.75 billion, representing a 9% year-over-year growth.   •	International: Net sales in the International segment grew from $31.9 billion to $37.4 billion, reflecting a 17% year-over-year growth.   •	AWS: Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud computing segment, experienced remarkable growth, with net sales increasing from $16.37 billion to $20.2 billion, showing a 23% year-over-year growth.      Conclusion:   Amazon demonstrated robust financial performance and growth in the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. The company's operating activities generated positive cash flow, and net sales increased consistently across all segments. Investments in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions reflect Amazon's focus on long-term growth and expansion.      Although the financing activities included cash outflows related to stock repurchases, the company's strong cash position and responsible debt management position Amazon well for future growth. The substantial improvement in net income and operating income signifies improved financial performance and operational efficiency.            PROs & CONs:   Pros:      •	Strong Revenue Growth: Amazon has consistently demonstrated strong revenue growth across its various segments. The company's ability to expand its customer base, introduce new products and services, and leverage its e-commerce platform has led to impressive financial performance.   •	Diversification of Business Segments: Amazon has successfully diversified its business beyond e-commerce. The expansion into cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been a major growth driver, providing the company with a stable and profitable source of revenue.   •	Innovative and Customer-Centric Approach: Amazon's relentless focus on customer satisfaction, innovative technologies like Amazon Prime, and personalized shopping experiences have helped the company build a loyal customer base and maintain a competitive edge in the market.   •	Financial Stability and Liquidity: The company maintains a strong cash position and prudent debt management, providing it with the financial flexibility to invest in new ventures and navigate economic uncertainties.   •	Global Reach: Amazon operates in numerous countries, allowing it to tap into diverse markets and consumer preferences worldwide. Its vast international presence positions the company for further growth and market dominance.   •	Leading Cloud Service Provider: AWS is a dominant force in the cloud computing industry, serving a wide range of clients, from startups to large enterprises. The profitability and growth of AWS contribute significantly to Amazon's overall financial success.      Cons:      •	Regulatory Scrutiny: Amazon faces increasing regulatory scrutiny related to its market dominance and business practices. Antitrust concerns and accusations of unfair competition may lead to potential legal challenges and fines.   •	Labor Practices: The company has faced criticism for its labor practices, including allegations of poor working conditions and treatment of employees at its fulfillment centers. Such negative publicity can impact Amazon's reputation and may affect its ability to attract and retain talent.   •	Highly Competitive Markets: The e-commerce and cloud computing industries are highly competitive, with major players vying for market share. Amazon faces challenges from established competitors and emerging startups, requiring continuous investment in innovation and technology.   •	Dependence on Global Supply Chain: Amazon's vast supply chain network is critical for delivering products to customers. Any disruptions, such as those caused by geopolitical events or natural disasters, could affect the company's operations and financial performance.   •	Profit Margins: While Amazon experiences strong revenue growth, its profit margins have historically been relatively low. Intense competition and ongoing investments in new ventures can put pressure on the company's profitability.   •	Environmental Impact: As a large-scale retailer and cloud services provider, Amazon's operations have an environmental impact. The company has faced criticism for its carbon footprint, and there are growing expectations from stakeholders for more significant efforts towards sustainability.   TLDR:   Amazon recent earnings report for the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, reveals a robust financial performance and impressive revenue growth across its segments. The company generated positive cash flow from operating activities, showing a significant increase in net income, indicating improved financial health and operational efficiency. Amazon's strategic investments in property, equipment, and acquisitions demonstrate a focus on long-term growth and expansion. With a strong cash position and responsible debt management, the company exhibits financial stability and flexibility. However, regulatory scrutiny, labor practices, and intense competition pose potential challenges. Despite these, Amazon remains a leading player in the e-commerce and cloud computing industries, presenting attractive prospects for investors seeking exposure to a market-dominant, innovative, and customer-centric company with a history of success and growth.

But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.   To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Marín Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.   The final list of named trends we researched was:   \-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.   \-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.   \-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.   \-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestlé, L'Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.   \-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.   \-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.   \-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.   \-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce   Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.   From first mention   Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.   For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S&P 500.   The first interesting finding: When we look at the average of all these eight named trends, we see considerable price run-up before the trade being named. For the 24 months before the zero-date, we see the average named trend deliver 36% in excess returns. This means that if you magically knew about a new named trend before it happened, you could earn 36 percentage points above the S&P 500 for the two years before it was named.   Worth the ride, until...   But even if you don't have this magical foresight, it still doesn't hurt to ride a trend once it has been coined. On average, once the trend has been named and looking ahead 12 months, an investor can still earn about 13 percentage points in excess returns.   Yet 12 months following the naming is about the best you can do as returns peak at this point on average and decrease a bit subsequently. From the 12-month mark to the 24-month mark after a trend has been named, the average named trend lags behind the S&P 500 by about 2 percentage points.   When we look at the individual named trends, it might surprise people that the two best trades from the zero-date to the 24-month mark in our sample were the BAT and Cloud trends -- both earning more than 60% in excess return over the two-year period once they were coined by the press.   On the other end, the MT SAAS trade did the worst, dropping more than 95% in excess returns over the two-year period after being named.   All in all, this means your best option is to jump on a named trend as soon as you first hear about it -- provided you haven't been too late to the party -- and ride the initial momentum, if it happens. But if you get in past the 12-month mark, the returns might not be so magnificent.

"Why is mister Market allowing a 8% discount for a fund?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b3d1ci/why_is_mister_market_allowing_a_8_discount_for_a/";"Currently the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund, Inc. (ASG) is being sold at a 8% discount. It's net asset value is 5.88$ per share, yet Mr. Market says that it's price is 5.41$.  Is the market irrational or am I missing something here?  I know that the fund has around 1.1% management fees, but this is on a yearly basis while the discount is happening on a daily basis. The fund also has 8% dividends. You could argue that the 8% dividends are the reason for the 8% difference in the market price, but you would be wrong, as again the dividend is paid on a quarter basis of just 2%, so it's again 6% free money till the next ex-dividend date. If the fund liquidate all it's assets the owners would have 8% of their investment's value for free - no dividend involved here, just pure liquidation of stocks, so no discount for selling physical assets etc. Besides giving out 8% of dividends is a good reason to value the fund higher than it's net value, no?  [https://www.all-starfunds.com/asg](https://www.all-starfunds.com/asg)  I know that the fund has been performing bad over the last year, but after all the net value is higher than the market price which seems like easy money.  One thing I don't understand is how is this fund is able to provide 8% dividends?

Apologies if this has already been posted in this community.   I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ.  https://archive.is/20231009181337/https://www.wsj.com/articles/picking-a-stock-for-the-year-2048-66d90e  The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.  So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold.   So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049.   Here is my list so far.   1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 ) 2. Costco 3. Johnson and Johnson 4. Waste Management 5. CVS 6. Home Depot 7. Boeing 8. Caterpillar 9. GE Aerospace 10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia 11. Walmart/Target 12. Starbucks / McDonalds 13. UPS 14. JP Morgan / Bank of America 15. Berkshire / Markel 16. Disney 17. Tesla / GM 18. Hershey 19. Dollar General 20. Lockheed Martin  Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate.   Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.  Edit: Some really good points in the comments.   1. Most of my regular investing goes to VOO. Think of this as a fun little experiment  2. Since all of these are mature large companies, maybe it makes more sense to go with mid cap stocks. In that case, what would you pick?";"127";"2024-01-18T22:13:00"
"Stockanalysis on Zalando - Europe E-Commerce Player";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aw6pkf/stockanalysis_on_zalando_europe_ecommerce_player/";"Hi Guys, please mention any flaw you see in my reasoning on the stock or in the numbers I mention, because I know humans are not perfect, especially me.  So Zalando is an E-Commerce Marketplace in Europe and they specialize in Fashion, while having about 7.000 Brands and over 1.8 Million Items on their Plattform.  Every Number i mentioned can be checked on the zalando investor relations website  Strategy:  So the company has a Revenue of about 10.5 Billion in LTM and a GMV of about 14.76. Right now around 40% of their GMV comes from third-parties and they try to execute the same strategy as Amazon is doing right now, which is selling less of their own fashion, which means the GMV should be growing faster than the revenue and the gross Margin should rise.  (Generally i think this development can be seen especially in E-Commerce Marketplaces, due to the E-Commerce Buisness being not that interesting, because of low barriers of entry, with Amazon FBA and Shopify, and not many Synergieeffects, resulting from taking different E-Commerce shops together. Here the only good Differentiations are good reviews or a Brand that people remember, which often goes together. But that just on the side.)  Also like Amazon they provide a Fullfillmentsolution to their Partners, which is also growing in the adoption of the third-party-sales on Zalando. Another interesting area is their acquisition of Highsnobiety, which provides a Fashion Newsfeed, that could enhance Sales through the Inputs provided by the News and could further enhance time spent on the Zalando website and App, which improves customerconnection and Sales.  I even think, that a Marketplace in the fashion e-commerce space should be even more interesting as a buisness model, than amazons marketplace model right now, due to the higher margins on the products, which can also lead to way higher comissions, than Amazon can charge for 10 meters of tape or something like that. So Zalando can maybe profit from their partners brands and the differentiation, that comes with them.  Financials and Macro:  So even though the strategy sounds pretty good, the numbers haven't performed in the same way. This is mostly due to 2022 and 2023 being pretty rough years for E-Commerce, due to people shopping a bit more in the real world again and mostly just the macro being much worse in general. The problem with fashion is, that it is very cyclical, because these expenses aren't life preserving and can easily be cut back a bit. Furthermore nearly all big fashion players in Europe, like About You, Asos and so on orderd way to much inventory in 2021, because they thought the E-Commerce trend would go on like in the covid times. (This can be seen pretty nicely, when visiting the $YOU ticker for About you or the $ZAL for Zalando and looking on the inventory as a percantage of revenue. - which should, with Zalando getting more of their revenue through comissions and other revenue streams, decrese -  These Problems caused Zalandos GMV to shrink right now with -2.5 %, with active customers in LTM also shrinking Q on Q. However this has to be seen relative to industrie peers, for example Asos shrinking -10 % or boohoo also - 10% and About you also slightly shrinking with -0.5%. So here you can see Zalando and About you taking performing way better than the rest of the European e-commerce market.  A Development which is especially linked to the high inventory levels is way lower gross margin, visible at every of the before mentioned companies. This comes from every Fashionshop trying to sell their inventory off, because they want to avoid big depreciation and amortization expenses. However this process is now close to being done, with many of the mentioned e-commerce shops having way healthier inventory numbers. So I don't see any reason, why the gross margins shouldn't climb back to the levels we saw before the last two years, which would be at Zalando from around 38% on average to about 42%.  So just this effect could get margins from around 2 % for the full year up to 6 %. Furthermore Zalando would, if their GMV grows at the 8% Cagr, that is predicted for E-commerce in Europe till 2029, certainly increase their operating margin to maybe 8-10 % with an Operating leverage (revenues growing with 4-6 %) and more profitable revenue thorough comissions and services for their third-party-sales. And the numbers mentioned are in my opinion quite conservativly estimated.  Now to their Balance Sheet: They have  around 2.2 billion in equity, however this surplus could be lower if they still have problems to sell their slightly elevated inventory levels, so we rather say 2 billion adjusting for the risk.  Market Cap: 5.17 Billion  So you would pay around a 0.3 Price to Revenue multiple if you subtract the equity from their market cap, but mostly you can't do this exactly, because the equity won't return around 7 % year on year(as the msci world), so we say it's rather a 0.4 price revenue multiple. So you pay a 0.4 revenue multiple, for the biggest Fashionmarketplace in Europe, where the market is estimated to grow around 8 % on average y on y to 2029 and the operating margin of Zalando can be expected to increase from the 2 % right now very fast to around 6 %, and long term to 8-10 %. with a 6 % operating margin you would pay around 7 times earnings(with 10 billion in revenues) for this very likely growing buisness, with further margin improvement to go.  Risks:  The most important risk i see comes of course from Asia, with Temu and Shein. They just produce with much lower costs than the brands in Europe and sell to much lower prices. However i think that especially in Europe there is still a big interest in owning and wearing brandclothes and another trend which further supports this trend is people more and more expressing themselves through clothes. So surely Temu and Shein will take some share, but more from Shops like H & M and less from Fashion Brands.  Of course many people would also think, that amazon will just also take the fashion e-commercemarket very easily, however i think, that people want a special place for buying their brand clothes and don't want to search bar for their product of choice. More and more of the sales will be impuls sales, with the customers scrolling through the app at a busstop and just buying something that they like, which is not possible with amazon, due to their big supply of many other things, than brand clothing.  Another risk is, that the macro enviroment right now is much worse and the DACH Market where around 45 % of their revenue lies, is growing a bit slower than the 8 % Cagr in Europe. Even though this is possible, their DACH-Market already is very profitable, with a 6 % operating margin despite the way lower gross margin, so the very likely higher growth rate in their rest of europe department could lead to higher Operating margins here, due to more growth and the operating leverage, that comes with it.  So i think most of the European e-commerce stocks are really undervalued and even though we won't see the growth rates from the covid e-commerce hype, these buisnesses will still grow at very decent rates and should further improve their profitability, which makes Zalando in my opinion a good investment.";"6";"2024-02-21T09:00:45"

The technique was developed by a Robert Lichello in 1977, published in his (very click-baity) book - How to Make a Million Dollars in the Stock Market Automatically [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Dollars-Stock-Market-Automatically/dp/0451174534)            There's not a lot of info about it online besides a handful of forum posts with people claiming success, and a couple of articles:      [https://toughnickel.com/personal-finance/robertlichelloAIMSystem](https://toughnickel.com/personal-finance/robertlichelloAIMSystem)      [https://authormichaelhicks.com/automatic-investment-management-by-robert-lichello/](https://authormichaelhicks.com/automatic-investment-management-by-robert-lichello/)      [https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/jxu28l/ive\_built\_a\_chatbot\_to\_act\_as\_a\_virtual\_assistant/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/jxu28l/ive_built_a_chatbot_to_act_as_a_virtual_assistant/)      [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5OOqVouLt0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5OOqVouLt0)      [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUoVEMdq1gI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUoVEMdq1gI)      I've been backtesting this with a dozen or so large-cap companies (as the book suggests), but I hardly see any advantage over Buy-and-Hold.

"All Public Pensions Funds Are Around 25 Percent Of Their Proclaimed Net Assets - Especially Calpers";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aepf5e/all_public_pensions_funds_are_around_25_percent/";"When are the members of public pension ever going to figure out that   the numbers that they get are not accurate.    if amazon stock trades at 100x earnings. Obviously this equity, which is representative of the entire stock market for its absurd valuation so far beyond its actual earning capability is a mockery of the intention of equity markets.    on the balance sheet of the pension fund it has a ""paper gain""   meaning the stock trades at 100x earnings so on paper the equity trades at 200 per share but in reality, it is really worth 25 x earnings due to its 15 percent growth rate, and not the highest quality management.    that means that if interest rates were ever competitive than the price of the stock would effectively be cut by 75 percent, meaning the balance sheet of CALPERS, the California teachers pension fund would be in tatters. The reason is that these companies do not have earnings that substantiate their market caps.   NONE of them do.   For whatever reason the fiduciaries of Calpers have not told their membership that in order for their pension to be good, they need to have investments.    To have investments, you need to be allowed to make investments.    you cannot make investments without FREE FLOATING DEBT   Meaning, you need a free market with debt. Or else, then the stock market gets so much capital that it becomes uninvestable, which is exactly what happened.   Yet, the calpers financial management, act like its 2003, when there was a free market in debt.   This is like reminiscent of bernie madoff style scam.    The reason is the debt markets were socialized.    You cannot have investments without price discovery   Hilarious enough, the people who complain about ""wealth inequality"" have    literally without exaggeration, made it impossible to get earnings from bank deposits and the stock market because THEY and also the republicans did not protest strongly, for a SUSPENSION of FREE FLOATING INTEREST RATES.   LITERALLY INTEREST RATE PRICE CONTROLS.   So,thereby making money worthless for investment.   Anyone who buys an equity today like amazon will VIRTUALLY NEVER get a return from the stock in their LIFETIME.   WHY haven't pension fund managers who get paid millions of dollars a year tell their membership that their pensions are threatened and COMPLETELY unsustainable without having free floating interest rates?   This is criminal level negligence. They continue drawing their checks as if nothing is awry.   Some estimates indicate that Calpers is in reality only 25 percent funded.     Why is this not in the public square yet? It's obvious when looking at STRATOSPHERIC valuations";"0";"2024-01-30T15:16:18"

Isn’t it this type of mania and exuberance that should give the market pause?   > Nvidia has effectively grown to more than 98% of the market for data-center graphics processing units, or GPUs, due to a complete lack of meaningful competition. This early lead has given the company unbounded pricing power, driving its margins in the most recent quarter to over 76%.  > over the past few months we have seen signs of competition entering the market. This will affect Nvidia’s margins and the company’s ability to continue to grow at such a staggering rate.   > the competition is coming from an array of places [in addition to AMD who is predicting $4B for their new GPU] that include a number of Nvidia’s largest and most important customers.

I'm curious about the investment strategy of buying high when it's a good company.  For examples, look at Microsoft, Amazon, Eli Lilly, and Nvidia.  All at very high points.  Hitting new all time highs even.  In theory, my heart says if you truly believe in the company and that the stock will go up, then buying high isn't a problem.  But my brain is just like, NO, it'll clearly go down.  You never buy high lol.  So what do YOU all do?  Do you have a favorite stock that you buy more of no matter how high it gets? Or do you just enjoy the ride with what you have and look for something else to invest in?  I do have some small positions in those four companies, which is why I'm familiar with them. Clearly I'm comfortable enough with them to hold the shares I have. But my brain is just so wired to not buy high at peaks.  I've read a decent amount of different strategies and things to look for, but I've never really seen anything about a successful company and buying high.  I know it could be a little subjective too. Depends on your age and risk tolerance and things like that and what you are looking for, but I guess I'm just trying to go for a more General approach in this question. But in an effort to help if people want, I'm mid 30s, married, kids on the way. Have a good job and not worry about retirement. My personal investing is to try to Simply make money for me and the family for stuff like trips and fixing the house and things like that, so risk tolerance is fairly high.

"1 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/";"Last year there was a post asking what folks were doing to profit from the current/upcoming recession on Hacker News: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33040211](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33040211)  I replied ([https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33041751](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33041751)) that I purchased some pandemic stocks, which I started doing in April 2022. Most of my purchasing was through summer 2022, but I've bought others more recently, like Carvana on the dip in December (which luckily popped since it became a meme stock), as well as Meta, Amazon and Google on the dips in October. The most recent was Allbirds on the dip in March since I had just purchased the shoes and they quickly became my favorite.  Overall, I'm up 36%, but as you can imagine a few winners (which I luckily have larger stakes in) make up for the losers. My target timeline is \~3 years, and we could still see a deeper recession from a hard landing, so I plan to post more annual updates.  There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I've summarized each with the overall unrealized gain/loss so far as of this morning:  * Affirm: -11.33% * Amazon: +25.25% * Allbirds: +9.43% * Coinbase: -34.32% * Carvana: +306.5% * Google: +29.35% * Meta: +170.89% * Cloudflare: +14.35% * Netflix: +97.08% * Peloton: -54.61% * Roblox: +25.14% * Shopify: +39.26% * Snapchat: +3.21% * Snowflake: +11.14% * Unity: +8.91%  **Some commentary**  It's hard to convey how much of a roller coaster the the last 12 months have been, with some pretty large negative swings that I just had to watch and not react to. There are likely more to come, especially since it seems a lot of the potential good news is already priced in.  Interestingly, in that post I mentioned Peloton was one I regretted almost instantly, and is now my worst performer by far. Unfortunately, greed got the best of me and I caught that falling knife buying a few times as the stock dropped further. I was hoping they would get rid of the excess inventory, improve distribution and double down on subscriptions to turn things around, but that hasn't materialized. Maybe it still will, or they get acquired.  Despite the strong gains, I still feel Shopify (improved focus, strong brand), Netflix (new ad tier, other new streaming services struggling and likely to go back to content), and Meta (improved targeting post privacy changes + AI opportunities) still have good upside potential.  I also really like Microsoft due to their enterprise moat and opportunities with AI, but their stock never had the correction the other stocks did and that was the scent I was chasing at the time (right or wrong). But long-term, I also wonder if AI will negate the need for human productivity software since the AI can just do it and review/edit mode requires less bloat (e.g. video with Final Cut Pro vs. TikTok, or images with Photoshop vs. Instagram). I wouldn't doubt if we see an AI-native productivity suite that doesn't just integrate AI, but predicated on simplfy reviewing AI generated content.  I'm disappointed to have missed Nvidia (up 3X since October) since I used to own it and have been watching it since the crypto bust created excess inventory and a predictable dip, then the AI trend led to the recovery. The valuation feels rich, but could easily grow into it given the trajectory of AI, unless the hyperscalers make their own chips.  Perhaps counterintuitively, it seems it's more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts than financial analysts/stock pickers since, at the end of the day, you need to make your own decisions about the fundamentals and prospects of the business. Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but by definition backward looking while valuation is forward looking.  I'm curious to see how these perform if the US enters a broader recession in the next 18 months. I don't plan to sell unless something catastrophic happens and I see a better opportunity to shift to.  **Update \~6mo later here:** https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15\_year\_followup\_on\_buying\_the\_dip\_on\_pandemic/";"170";"2023-06-12T21:18:14"

I wanna invest into AI and cant decide whats the best call there.

Investing into S&P Tech will give me big Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA but not the other companys. Investing into NASDAQ 100 will give me all of them, but with a lower Rate (can be good can be bad). And of course i just can buy those 6 Stocks.     I think Apple (even if they dont have LLMs yet) will be big in AI in 1-2 Years and the capability shipping local AI on all of their devices are insane.  Huge potential here + we talk about Apple. Microsoft is playing the AI game better than anyone else right now and coming GPT Versions will slap. I also like the new approach of Meta and with LLAMA there is also huge Potential. NVIDIA is of course also a no brainer (even if some ppl think they are overvalued), they are way ahead of other companys like AMD right now.

Imagine buying a penthouse for $5 million dollars and then being able to rent it out at a fair market price for $1.8 million dollars a year. It would seem as if the penthouse was sold for way under value.   Below is an in depth explanation on why Terawulf is way under value.   **WHAT DOES TERAWULF DO?**   Terawulf has built two facilities in New York and Pennsylvania that are basically two huge state of the art computers. They’ve built these computer facilities to create an enormous amount of computing power. They then use this computing power to make money.   For Example: AI or artifice intelligence requires a lot of computing power. Terawulf is currently working with Talen and Amazon where they might sell their computing power to Amazon to power Amazon’s AI. Basically Amazon rents Terawulf’s facilities computing power, instead of building their own.   This potential Amazon deal is however a speculative future endeavor and not why I am writing this today. It just helped me explain what Terawulf has built without using the scary B word... Bitcoin.   However, that’s exactly what Terawulf is doing with their computing power.   They are “mining Bitcoin” or using their computing power, to help run the Bitcoin network. Similar to how Google could hire Terawulf’s computing power, to help run their email system GMAIL.   Terawulf, gets paid in Bitcoin daily, and immediately sells it for a hefty profit. The Terawulf CEO has invested millions of his own money into Terawulf and stated that the company is not in the business of speculating on the price of Bitcoin. They simply “Mine” Bitcoin everyday for a profit in American Dollars, not Bitcoin.   **TERAWULF’S BACKSTORY**   TERAWULF was formed in 2021, and their plan was to lock in long term cheap North American power (5-20 year plans). Not just any power, but Zero Carbon energy. Not only is it better for the environment, but in a world where regulations are moving in that direction, it’s better to be ready for it.   Once they locked in inexpensive green power, they bought land and started construction on buildings. Right now they have buildings in New York and Pennsylvania. Two states that have had discussions and laws even passed against companies mining bitcoin... but mining bitcoin with “bad” energy. Since Terawulf’s goal is 100% carbon free energy, they don’t have to worry.   Terawulf spent all of 2021 - 2022 getting their facilities ready. They started turning on the computers in 2023, but are still building and turning on new machines for 2024, and anticipate this continuing into 2025.   This all leads into why I believe they are so undervalued.   **STOCK PRICE**   Terawulf began this venture in 2021, during the last cryptocurrency bull run. Speculation was crazy in 2021 around anything crypto and Bitcoin related. Along with many other assets and mining companies, WULF’s price rocketed to a high of $44 per share in Nov 2021.   However soon after Bitcoin’s price went down and so did Terawulfs. WULF shares dropped as low as $0.53 in March 2023.   Rightfully so, I mean Terawulf up until that point had just taking on hundreds of millions in debt to build their facilities. According to their earnings reports this company just lost money month after month, year after year. They were an idea in 2021.   Most people don’t know what Bitcoin Mining is, so they see Terawulf, they see it’s a bitcoin mining company and don’t really know what the hell that means.   They’re investors not computer tech folks. So they look at what they do know, the earnings reports and well, the earnings reports are terrible. They don’t know why or care, however we now know it’s because Terawulf is still in the building stages.   It’s as if Ferrari spent over two years building a race car. But every month people asked how fast the race car was, and Ferrari said it went 0 mph. So everyone continued to write off this race car as a failure, without knowing that it was going to take 3 years to build.   They shouldn’t judge how fast it goes until it’s built, just like the market shouldn’t have judged Terawulf on how profitable it was before it was built.   I think the stock market thinks Terawulf is a fully built race car that goes 0mph, when in reality it is a half built race car that when fully built, will be the fastest car in the race.   Earnings reports are a major factor in how investors judge a company. Most articles and reports online are based off Terawulf’s released earnings reports. Those earnings reports don’t go past sept 2023, and those reports are very bad.   Currently, when you research Terawulf online, you’re likely to find a writeup that an algorithm wrote based off earnings reports before Oct 2023. The reports are filled with BAD numbers, and don’t explain that Terawulf was simply building their race car.   Now normally everyone has to wait until the company releases its earnings report to know how everything going. Not with Terawulf though.   Terawulf is not your average company, they are very transparent and have been releasing their numbers on their social media and their website. They are proud of what they accomplished and believe in a company that doesn’t hide behind walls, but instead informs investors of exactly what is going on.   They don’t pay for fancy marketing, they just make a damn good product and wait for word to catch on.   However, NOBODY is reading Terawulf’s reports... their twitter posts get maybe 100 likes, and a few spam comments.   So unless you’re one of the few like me listening, you are judging their company on the terrible earnings reports from 2021 thru September 2023.   However they just started turning on their machines in 2023, and have been expanding at a rapid rate throughout 2024.   On Fidelity and Charles Schwab if you click on reports for Terawulf and look at earnings... MISSED in big red letters pops up.   For investors it’s basically saying LOSER LOSER LOSER, over and over and over.   However, on March 28th 2024 the official earnings report comes out for Oct-Dec 2023.   Now if you’re following Terawulf on social media and understand Bitcoin Mining you’d know that Q4 was a bit of a winner this time. You’d also know that Q1 of 2024 is an even bigger winner. However, the vast majority of people simply wait for the official earnings reports.   Basically we are ahead of curve by 6 months.   I don’t know when exactly Wall Street is going to catch up on this, but right now WULF seems like a diamond in the rough. The confusion around what exactly is Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining, mixed with the delayed earnings reports has falsely labeled Terawulf a loser.   I anticipate that between now and summer of 2024 the market will catch on.   We discussed the price of the stock versus the earnings of the company. This is called a P/E ratio for short. Terawulf’s P/E ratio right now is about 4/1 since the entire value of the company is four times more than their gross earnings for the year.   In comparison to the software industry average of 56/1 which is what fidelity chose to compare it to Terawulf to.   A 56/1 P/E for Terawulf would value the stock $28 a share instead of $2 a share.   MARA Marathon Digital is a mining company that has a current P/E of 23/1. WULF at $11 a share would be a 23/1 P/E.   Now there are many other factors to consider and I think $10 a share is closer to a fair value.   I also think the stock could go to $100 a share considering how crazy the market can get, especially around something with the word Bitcoin in it.   However I am not an expert with how to value a company like this, should it be 3 billion or 10 billion, I’m not sure. What the stock market values is a best guess.   There’s so many things to consider, and nothing is guaranteed in this world. A comet could hit the Terawulf facility and blow it up tomorrow and drive the price to a few pennies.   I’m not a finial advisor, I have no idea your finances nor can I guarantee my beliefs or that I am missing something. I’m simply stating what I find interesting about this company and sharing that info and my beliefs.   Anyway, thanks for reading. Below is some more info to consider.   **DEEPER DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE**   SHORTS   Another reason why the price is so low, are the shorts have been opening up on this stock since 2022. This is just speculation, but I believe these shorts are coming from knowledgeable traders, who understood they would be out of profit for two years, or lenders who have hedged their investment.   For anyone who doesn’t understand Shorts, it’s basically a way to make money if the stock price goes down, and coincidently, investing in a short position on a stock helps drive the price down.   The shorts are slowly beginning to close and I have a feeling those shorts will close up completely by June 2024. Shorts closing brings stock price up.   TRENDING BUZZ WORDS CREATING HYPE   To add fuel to the fire, Terawulf prides itself in using green clean energy that’s carbon free, a very popular narrative. One thing I’ve learned in trading is that the best “story” often wins out. They also announced in Dec 2023 that they’re working with amazon and A.I. to capitalize the use of their mining machines. Two great buzz words for investors, “A.I.” & “Carbon Free Energy.” This mixed with the hype around Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies makes me think Terawulf’s stock price could go from highly undervalued to high over valued.   STOCK DILUTION   One negative I noticed was how Terawulf has been diluting their stock. Kind of how when the FED prints more dollars and as a result the price of groceries goes up. It’s normal for a company to be issuing stock to pay bills and incentivize employees. 40% of the company is owned by insiders, which means the people working for the company seem to believe in its success. They don’t seem to plan on heavy stock dilution for 2024 from what I’ve heard them say, and while it’s something to consider, I don’t see it as a major red flag.   WULF HISTORY   Terawulf was started in 2021, they bought IKONICS CORPORATION in 2021. So if you look at the history of the stock ticker symbol WULF, you will notice it goes back to 1993.   However, this price data doesn’t imply to the current company Terawulf, since as planned Terawulf sold Ikonics in 2022.   This WULF stock history adds to the confusion and messes with any algorithms taking in numbers from the old company and projecting it onto the new company.   Another reason why this company is flying under the radar... for now.   DEBT   Terawulf took on Debt, they have been paying off their debt enormously the last few months. So while the old earnings reports have their debt listed over 100 million, it’s more like 50 million and dropping.   BITCOIN PRICE   Bitcoins price does effect WULF’s profit, but they have set themselves up to be profitable well into the foreseeable future, including after the April 2024 Bitcoin Halving. Explaining the Bitcoin halving would be a lot right now, but it’s basically an event happening in April 2024 that effects the profits of Bitcoin miners. There’s a lot of miners that aren’t in a good position to capitalize on this event. Terawulf is in my opinion set up to be one of the most profitable mining companies after the halving. Once again this is a very complex thing to understand, but I’ve seen articles scaring Bitcoin Mining investors about the halving, and rightfully so. Just because Terawulf is set up for success doesn’t mean the Bitcoin Mining Market as a whole might not panic and temporarily drive down mining company prices. Another thing of many I’ve considered and any investor should too.   THANK YOU   Once agin, I could be missing something here, Terawulf could be lying like Enron for all we know, I do not know everything nor can I predict the future.   So if you do your own research please let me know if you find something I missed, I’ll be very grateful.   Thanks for reading!";"0";"2024-03-13T02:44:12"

In that sense, a company-specific risk, in my opinion, can easily be diversified away.

Because, startup has a company-specific risk like unforeseeable cash flows, but it is something non-systematic and can be diversified away. Right?   We of course don't use the same cost of capital because the startup is a riskier asset, but what I don't understand here, if we don't consider any additional risk premium for risks that can be diversified away, why don't we use a similar cost of capital for a startup with Apple, Amazon, etc...";"0";"2024-04-08T14:21:37"

Reasons for NVIDIA Share Increase:  Cutting-edge Technology: NVIDIA is at the forefront of groundbreaking technology, like artificial intelligence (AI) and graphics processing units (GPUs). Here's why it matters: NVIDIA's AI advancements have the power to transform industries such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and data analytics. Their GPUs dominate the gaming market, offering high-performance hardware that gamers love. Strong Partnerships: NVIDIA has formed strategic alliances with major tech giants, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, unlocking exciting opportunities: Collaborations with these influential companies put NVIDIA at the center of emerging technologies like cloud computing and machine learning. NVIDIA's recent acquisition of ARM Holdings gives them an even greater advantage in the semiconductor industry. Expanding into New Markets: NVIDIA's reach extends beyond gaming and AI, entering exciting sectors that are gaining momentum: Cryptocurrency mining has seen a significant surge, increasing the demand for NVIDIA GPUs, which boosts their sales and revenue. NVIDIA's focus on the automotive industry, developing advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technology, positions them as a key player in the future of transportation. Impressive Financial Performance: NVIDIA has a track record of delivering strong financial results, which bodes well for future growth: Consistent revenue and profit growth over the years demonstrate NVIDIA's ability to deliver solid financial outcomes, which may attract more investors. The company's robust cash flow allows for continued investment in research and development, ensuring they stay ahead of the competition. Remember, these arguments are purely speculative and aimed at generating discussion. Always conduct thorough research and analysis before making any investment decisions.";"0";"2023-06-11T14:55:11"

I don't think other big tech (Microsoft, OpenAI, and AWS) giants will order more GPUs because running a general-purpose GPU is very expensive: [Running ChatGPT is very expensive for the company. Each query costs roughly 4 cents, according to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/)   Google already has its own ASICs chips called TPU.    Apple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet, then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family.      Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run.  And want to diversify to other chip makers, like AMD, Intel, and specialized ARM makers.     Small businesses experiment and run their AI models using rented Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud capacities (mostly Google because of their TPU's low power-to-cost ratio).      The rest of the market is peanuts to make any dent.      **\[Conclusions\]:** Their a moderate-low probability Q4 revenues will reach a plateau of around 15-20 billion.  A moderate probability that they will be below 15 billion. A low probability of exceeding 20 billion.  &#x200B:  ***Let's sidestep to AI marker TAM topic,***        [*Meanwhile, looking forward to 2027, the server market's value is estimated at a staggering $195.6 billion.*](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-ai-and-hpc-gpu-sales-reportedly-approached-half-a-million-units-in-q3-thanks-to-meta-facebook)   However, this estimated revenue will be brought by those who rent AI processing capacities like AWS, GCP, and Azure cloud providers. And not ChatGPT clones. The market has not figured yet the TAM (total addressable market) of services like ChatGPT.

[The average cost of 1 query from a used is 4 cents](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/).     A single user runs 2,000 queries per month on average. The query is a single text message you send to the chatbot.      2000 \* 0.04 = 80 $ to service 1 user per month.    Until the OpenAI level of efficiency improves they will be losing 70$ to service 1 user per month.    No wonder OpenAI has closed its ChatGPT Plus subscription.  It doesn't seem sustainable.     Last note,  the majority of data centers upgrade their equipment every 4-5 years. So, if AI expectations won't burst, and chip efficiency improves 10-fold, and other chip makers won't catch up, don't expect big tech to re-stock their chips earlier than the end of 2027.      &#x200B:";"4";"2024-01-21T23:17:52"

"Is it easy to “beat the market” now?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1burmr0/is_it_easy_to_beat_the_market_now/";"Short question, if you invest in the top tech companies, is it easy to beat the marketing meaning the S&P?  We’ve all heard the mantra “you’ll never beat the market” but is that really true any more or does the phrase need some sort of updating?  I’ve been investing for 15 years now and I think I be beat the market or at least the overall S&P500 every single year.  There might have been a year that I nominally missed but if you add up all my investments and look at the gains, it’s significantly higher than if I just invested in a boring S&P ETF.  My Fidelity account does this for me automatically and I’ve always been higher…for over a decade now.   So hear me out, I’ve made some dumb mistakes and lost $$$ along the way but my winners have always offset that. My game plan is pretty simple: always invest in large cap stocks.    With a diverse portfolio made up of Microsoft, Nvidia, Facebook (now meta), Amazon, Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, Amd, and a few others, I’ve found this sector completely destroys the overall “market.” Sure I have a few outliers like Home Depot and OLIN but when I look at my pie chart, it’s very aggressive and very heavily in tech.    The difference in the S&P vs the NASDAQ confirms this over the last 20 years or more and you could argue I’ve built my own sort of NASDAQ mutual fund in a ways, but I’m still beating the NASDAQ too.    The contrarian’s argument is that given enough time, my large cap tech picks will eventually falter and I will begin losing but at the amount I’m up right now, for over a decade, that correction would have to be astronomical and I don’t see how the whole world economy wouldn’t fall if these tech picks crash down 50% at once.    I’m not trying to brag or troll this group or anything like that.  I’m just genuinely interested to know if tech has made it relatively easy to now beat the overall market, and if so, what consequences does that have on the stability of the whole market if more investors start doing what I’m doing?    Is there a point where the “market” is all tech now?  It sure feels like the S&P is so heavily weighted by tech now that maybe that’s the real underlying answer to my question.

"Columbus OH Market & Emerging Markets";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1bg58fh/columbus_oh_market_emerging_markets/";"So while shopping the Columbus Ohio market, I came across a couple of data points to share for input.      I would like to purchase rental property there and I'm reviewing some stats.  * Population is up 26.8% from 2000    * Median income is $58,202, and is up 54% from the year 2000, as per city-data    * Median house or condo value is $219,200, and is up 121% from year 2000, as per city-data (or about 5% appreciation per year average)    * Overall crime is down 79% compared to 2012, as per city-data    * Vacancy rate is 4.72%, as per dept of numbers    * Unemployment is 3.2%, as per dept of numbers (state average is 3.7%)  I plugged numbers into this deal analysis calculator (its free) that indicates the ideal purchase price for rental property based upon the income of the location (low-to-high end).  * It says the best purchase price range (all-in) is between $80k and $134k using the 4.7% vacancy rate (as shown above), 40% operating expenses and a target cap rate of 10%.    * I didn't include a credit for any deferred maintenance or front-end CapEx expenses.       * I'll do that case-by-case. * It also says the ""Low"" to ""High"" rent rates (based on the median income as a ""Mid"") are $1,200/month to $2,000/month (based upon the property/location).    * This seems a little high but I guess if I used a zip code versus the entire city, it would be more accurate (if it is in-fact inaccurate). * I then input my APR, term, DP and CC and it tells me my cash flow would be between $240/month and $403/month, of course based upon rent-to-price ratio and my expenses.  When I input this criteria into Zillow it gives me 45 results. Which is great because I don't need to sift through endless listings that won't make sense from the jump. But, I did filter the prices up to $160k just in case there were some extended days on market and they'd consider a lower offer.  My questions are:  * How reliable do you think these data points are today? ...City data only goes up to 2021 * Are these rent rates on par as well as the vacancy rate? ...within the city limits that is... * Are you cash flowing in this range if you have rentals there?

"Is the IT industry experiencing a growth spurt, or is this a bubble?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/13qo5vm/is_the_it_industry_experiencing_a_growth_spurt_or/";"Bernard Arnault, the head of LVMH, may be the wealthiest individual in the world, but IT companies still hold the title of the most valuable. Even following the recent market adjustment, **Apple** boasts a valuation exceeding $2.6 trillion, with **Microsoft** at $2.34 trillion, and **Alphabet** at $1.56 trillion.  How can this be? **Don't large tech firms also face the threat of economic downturns?**  Indeed, they do. However, the members of the MAMAA conglomerate (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet) took proactive measures to prepare for a potential economic slowdown by decreasing spending, which included a **reduction in labor costs**...  The recent **turbulence in the U.S. banking sector** has further funneled funds into the tech industry. Investors have shown a preference for companies boasting substantial profit margins and large cash reserves over more traditional safe-haven assets.  Another factor driving growth has been the **surge in Artificial Intelligence**. Investors anticipate that the capital injected into this sector will yield increased sales and, subsequently, elevated profits. Microsoft, for instance, anticipates a 6.7 percent revenue increase in the current quarter due to the rising demand for AI solutions.  Heading into 2023, the IT sector strikes a somewhat subdued chord: the Nasdaq Index suffered a decline of almost 33% in 2022. However, with **decreasing inflation** and the **prospect of a pause in Fed rate hikes**, tech stocks have regained their allure.  One also should not forget to note that key support propping up Nasdaq members was **stock buybacks**. Recall, too, that both Alphabet and Apple recently announced buybacks amounting to $70 billion and $90 billion respectively. Additionally, Meta, formerly Facebook, announced a stock buyback of $40 billion.  What lies on the horizon? **What are the analysts' predictions?**  Michael Landsberg, Chief Investment Officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management, asserts that [large tech stocks are currently overvalued](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/megacap-tech-stocks-out-of-control-big-tech-still-has-the-power-to-extend-the-rally-and-weather-an-economic-storm-analysts-say-a60b6bc3). For example, Microsoft shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 34.3, while Amazon's PE ratio (TTM) stands at 273.79.  On the other hand, analysts at Bank of America [do not foresee any reason for alarm](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worries-over-big-tech-driving-135954915.html), and they predict that the flourishing market will persist.  So **what should we anticipate next?** If the Fed deviates from its hawkish stance, the rally could possibly extend. If not, the recent market correction may appear minor in comparison to what could transpire. Additionally, the approaching debt ceiling deadline could provoke another stock market adjustment, as new Treasury debt issuance could drain Fed reserves and curtail liquidity.";"3";"2023-05-24T17:02:49"
"Who believes inflation is over?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/13v2ecx/who_believes_inflation_is_over/";"Inflation seems to have fallen out of the headlines recently given the lower CPI readings in the past few months. The market seems to be pricing a pretty significant decline in interest rates based on the forward SOFR curve. Does anyone think this not right?  Just log on to your Amazon account and have a look at items you bought in 2020 or early 2021. Every single item that I have bought has increased 25% to 100%+ in the past 3 years. You see it at Costco, you see it at restaurants.  Wage growth has only really occurred on a percentage basis for the lower skilled minimum wage job, and nowhere enough to cover the massive cost of living increases.  Is wage price inflation off the table because people are too scared of losing their jobs? Do people just accept a lower standard of living than before?  I can really only see inflation going away if people accept a lower standard of living and not push for higher wages.  EDIT: Not saying inflation is going to 0%, but I'm thinking it's too early to assume we are headed back down to 2% and the job is done. I think it's way more likely we stay in this 4% to 5% range or even head higher from here if wage inflation starts to kick in because people are not content with the diminished buying power.";"0";"2023-05-29T20:21:31"

"Just how big are the Magnificent Seven?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19az17m/just_how_big_are_the_magnificent_seven/";"This is a big quote from MarketWatch. I’ve seen the numbers before, but this really gave me pause.   > These captains of the SS S&P 500 are Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. They've been described as the magnificent seven by many news organizations. Fortunately for me, there's a common thread among this group. They are the only U.S. companies that have ever been valued at a trillion dollars by the public markets. To say these companies are dominating the S&P 500 is a giant understatement. Last year, their collective valuation gained more than $5 trillion. Compare that to the S&P 500's valuation gain of less than $8 trillion. That means the trillionaires were responsible for roughly 65% of the Index's market cap gain last year, despite comprising just 1.4% of its components. But doesn't this go against the main reason behind investing in S&P 500 index funds? Wouldn't the entire index be susceptible to a massive drop if just one of these seven companies failed?  > Phil Van Dorn: Well, I like index funds because they spread out your risk over many stocks and because the expenses are so low. In the mutual fund industry, traditionally, you might be looking at expenses of 1% of assets under management per year, and that can really pile up over time. But with an S&P 500 Index Fund, your expenses get close to zero. But as you have mentioned when you called the group of expensive stocks the Trillionaires' Club, a small group of companies now make up between 27 and 30% of the S&P 500 depending on which day you look at it.  > Jeremy Owens: Right, so that's seven out of 500 companies accounting for more than a quarter or less than a third of the entire market cap of the S&P 500 and really swaying the underlying metrics. What should an investor kind of take from this and how should we look at the S&P 500 moving forward, knowing how much these companies matter?  > Phil Van Dorn: One can say that there's a heck of a lot of risk in the seven companies that make up only 1% of the S&P 500, but make up close to a third of its value. However, the S&P 500 is self-correcting. It rewards success.";"28";"2024-01-20T01:51:08"

"Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1apur6l/looking_at_historical_data_does_it_show_that_this/";"Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market? I say that by looking at the data. For example. Amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. That is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself, but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. Also I have another example. Nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. The margins are high but obviously companies like Meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent GPU solutions to control costs, and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. The same is looking at arm. Arm which trades at like 150 x earnings, or something crazy, literally grows at like 28 percent. That means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity.  Then, if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004, Apple, it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth, a tiny market cap, better leadership. This compared to the 2000's investing environment or earlier is terrible, yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want.     It goes on and on. Looking at Palantir which trades at a crazy multiple, or basically any software company, yes it's possible to buy Palantir or any stock and it triple, but trying to get earnings at a good multiple in other words, Real INVESTING seems to be literally impossible right now.     Even the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like Alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline.      And there are questions like how is this possible and is this partly due to extremely irresponsible Fed reserve activity mainly due to QE pushing valuations to their highest levels ever.

"One common mistake of a novice trader";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19fgbu1/one_common_mistake_of_a_novice_trader/";"Let's imagine the mindset of beginners. Beginners want to earn quickly, a lot and with minimal effort. And most likely, we know from our experience, they will be quite fearful. So they will choose those instruments that are well-known and have a good reputation. These will probably be stocks of companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple.  **How will beginners add companies to their portfolio?**   Let's specify that the stocks of these companies are not cheap and cost 100-300 dollars. Of course beginners want to fill their portfolio on enthusiasm right now. This means our trader will go to the stock exchange and simply buy them.   **What is wrong with that?**   The point is that you should buy shares of even the seemingly coolest and most famous companies not at any moment of time when you want to, but look at whether it is a good time to enter a position.   **What does good or bad timing mean?**   In investing for 10-15 years the concepts of good and bad time lose their relevance. Because for such a long period of time stocks can fall and rise 100 times.  But if we speak about from 1 to 6 months trading, it is very important to choose the right moment. Because you need to earn money rather quickly and you want to earn more, of course.   For the sake of simplicity let's consider 2 companies: META and AAPL.    Both of them have a beautiful growing chart for the last year of trading, but you should not buy both companies now, if you take them for a short term.   The fact is that META and AAPL stocks are at their all-time highs right now. They have rallied strongly over the past couple months and there will soon be a period when the price will be corrected. Since there is no one chart in the market that is a forever rising straight line. There will always come moments of correction. And if you buy their stocks now, you are very likely to buy at the most expensive price in recent times.   That's why it's important to learn how to analyze charts and choose the moments to buy or sell smartly.";"0";"2024-01-25T19:36:53"

"First-time Poster (go easy)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15cx8ny/firsttime_poster_go_easy/";"TLDR: Swapping from Edward Jones to Schwab and looking for traditional IRA and other recommendations. \*Apologies for the following novel!     Hey folks, I am looking for some strategic advice. I started investing three years ago when I finished active-duty military service. My wife and I stupidly didn’t save or invest any money during my 20 years of service, so no IRAs or TSP starting off. We collectively were living paycheck-to-paycheck during my military service based on terrible spending habits.     In 2021 we sold a house which netted us around $150k. We bought another (at 2.499 interest) but put very little down because we used our VA loan and I wanted to feel the security of having cash on hand. We have kept the rest of the proceeds in the breakdown below. Not really knowing what I was doing, I opened accounts with Edward Jones and started throwing money at it. We were able to open the Roth's based on my income then, but have since become ineligible to add to those due to high income. Also, we bought all of the individual stocks and watched them plummet in 2022, but they have since recovered and we are basically back where we started.     Fast-forward to now, we still spend what I consider a ridiculous amount of money every month, but we are working to correct it and double-down on investing for retirement. I started working with a great company that does a 5% match with John Hancock, and I am maxing that contribution every year (about $20k) with 75% into RFHTX and 25% into the 500 Index Fund. I am not looking to change that allocation unless folks have a compelling recommendation. Additionally, we have roughly $5k/month that is unused (saved) and put in our normal bank savings account which is really giving us no return, about 60 dollars a month, so not really sure what to do there… I should note that I plan to work for at least the next 15-20 years and expect my current income level to remain static or increase.     So my questions are:    \-	As we are moving into Schwab, what index funds or ETFs would make the most sense for the Roth IRAs?   \-	Should we be maxing out Traditional IRAs with the intent to do a backdoor conversion later?    \-	What should be done with the cash that we have in our bank’s low-interest savings account?   \-	Are we on track or do I need to make some drastic move like taking savings and paying off vehicles / dropping the savings into my mortgage to reduce it / other?      One thought I have is to make the transition to Schwab and put the Roth’s/529s into whatever the advisor recommends. Then liquidating the $50,000 in individual stocks from EJ, put that money into a MMF with Schwab and use that money to fund Traditional IRAs for my wife and I. Would this be a smart move?      Below are some of our financial stats:   Age: 44 – seeking to retire between 60-65 y.o.   Current take home (net) income: $20,000/mo   \-	$12,000 from employment   \-	$8,000 from military retirement & VA disability   Monthly bills: $10,000/month   Discretionary spending: $5,000/mo   Current 401k: $88,000   (Edward Jones) Existing Roth IRAs: $20,000   USAA Savings account: $90,000   (Edward Jones) Kid’s 529s: $8,000 (although both kids have GI Bill, so won’t likely “need” the 529s)   (Edward Jones) Individual stock positions: $50,000   \-	Alphabet (100 shares)   \-	Amazon (60)   \-	Apple (50)   \-	Blackrock (5)   \-	Duke Energy (10)   \-	Meta (20)   \-	Microsoft (10)   \-	Southwest (100)   \-	Disney (20)   ";"3";"2023-07-29T19:02:26"
"Investing in software companies (tin foil chat)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18v3s5e/investing_in_software_companies_tin_foil_chat/";"Wanted to share some thought on how to pick stocks in technology. I want to focus on the quality of revenue. I did t know this until I spoke with a few experts and got me thinking about fraud and if there is a method to spot fraud in technology consistently.   I was brought up in the UK in the 90s and 00s where some managers made a fortune by investing in internet companies. Most of those people were long only investors and the horizon was super long. Their main thesis was around changes in society, habitual changes, that would have led to some internet companies to show abnormal growth in stock price. Amazon, Google, FB, Microsoft etc. These managers literally became millionaires.   The legacy of these managers dies hard and there are many money managers betting on healthcare tech (bio tech), food industries or energy transition. Their bets are almost always driven by top down analysis, instead of understanding the operations of each company. Most of these firms generate their money from licensing.   Licensing revenue has distinct characteristics such as - multi year firm wide contract  - cost of switching tends to be expensive  - once signed, your revenue is basically guaranteed for a good few years   One often overlooked is the fact that companies have a great leeway on when to book/show sales and cancellations in their book if and when these multi year licensing contracts get cancelled.  Imagine a hypothetical scenario where a firm sells a licensing agreement. The customer gives a notice or intent to cancel this licensing agreement at the end of the term or even in the middle of it for whatever reasons.   - there is often penalty involved in early termination  - the notice period is longer often in months  How does this cancellation appear in your quarterly or semi annual reports?  For this potential loss to appear in the official report, you would need this cancellation to be passed to a relevant department and recorded.   How does a customer give a notice to the firm of the intention to cancel the licensing agreement? Through their sales or relationship contact.   Once the sales team receives this cancellation, is there a process that gets initiated or can the sales team decide when to pass this cancellation notice to their management?   This cancellation doesn’t look good on the sales team that covers that region or customer type. Particularly if the contract amount was large, the bonus would be impacted. The sales team often starts a campaign to minimize the impact of the cancellation or at least understand why the contract is being terminated. These campaigns, due to the nature of the contract, could run months, right up to the date of the actual cancellation. And from what I hear, not very effective use of the sales teams time.   At what point, is the sales team forced to record this cancellation in their book? I think they will delay recording this loss of revenue till the very last day or they try to smooth the loss by booking this loss when there is a significant gain in revenue (new contract for example).   Does the same happen to new customer acquisitions? It could. Maybe preferable to record a new sale in certain months, due to accounting or reporting reasons, or bonus reasons.   For these reasons, technology firms revenue sometimes appears incredibly smooth, smooth because they are cooked, not by management of the firm that might have no knowledge of the book cooking of this nature, but rather on the ground by those who carry out day to day jobs.   This makes me want to spot firms without proper governance to short them. Firms seemingly doing well are the targets. Firms that rely on a few products are the targets instead of large diversified firms.   Eventually I think regulators will step in, but at the moment, they don’t seem to have much clue around technology licensing businesses.   Maybe this is a tin foil discussion";"0";"2023-12-31T09:59:01"
"What allocation approach is implied by Toby Nangle's new FT article on narrow markets driving equity returns?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15lgfgb/what_allocation_approach_is_implied_by_toby/";"What I take from the article below is not to rely too much on a macro-driven asset allocation strategy.  But what asset allocation strategy makes sense in this environment then?    &#x200B:  &#x200B:   www.ft.com /content/c5d7ee71-92a2-4840-9344-2f62e9642e61  # Narrow markets should humble macro forecasters  5-6 minutes   2023-08-08   Toby Nangle    The writer is a former global head of asset allocation at a fund manager   This year has been marked by strong equity markets, and what looks to be an astonishingly narrow rally. Of the 16.9 per cent returned by the S&P 500 index in the first half of this year, 12.9 per cent derived from the performance of only 10 companies.   With such a high proportion of a market’s value created by so few groups, it feels fair to question the tool kits of asset allocators and, more broadly, the product line-up of fund management firms.   Narrow stock market returns are, after all, the norm. Research by Arizona State University professor Hendrik Bessembinder shows that more than half of the $55.1tn in net wealth generated by the US equity market between 1926 and 2022 came from the performance of fewer than 0.3 per cent of the market’s stocks, with the other half of this net wealth coming from the next best 3.1 per cent of stocks.   Moreover, almost three-fifths of stocks actually destroyed wealth over the period. In quant-speak, the distribution of compound stock returns has been very positively skewed.   In addition, the skewness of equity returns turns out not to be a particularly North American phenomenon. Indeed, in the three decades ending in December 2020 the proportion of net wealth contributed by the best 1 per cent of emerging market stocks was more than 80 per cent.   Looking at the entire global stock universe outside the US, the proportion rises still further to more than 90 per cent. Winners have won big. Most individual stocks over the past 30 years have failed to outperform dollars stored under the mattress, let alone a local currency interest-bearing cash deposits — even after taking into account dividends.   Bessembinder’s work has typically been surveyed in terms of what it means for active stockpickers — with some seeing it as a rationalisation for chasing moonshots and others for pursuing passive index-investing. Less examined has been what it means for asset allocators.   Developed market stock index returns have been dominated by global companies — even if they each carry a domestic tilt. As such, connecting local macroeconomic developments to the performance of a region’s equity index can be something of a dark art.   Single large stocks with an economic fate that has little to do with their listing jurisdiction have dominated national index returns. For example, the photolithography machine-maker ASML accounts for more than a fifth of the total net wealth created by Dutch stocks in the 30 years up to 2020. Global fast-fashion retailer Inditex accounts for more than a sixth of Spanish stock returns. Global luxury brands LVMH and L’Oréal collectively account for almost a quarter of the returns from French stocks. These are not outliers. One cannot explain long-term returns without reference to such companies in pretty much any region.   If it becomes hard to explain equity index returns without reference to specific superstar groups, it stands to reason that it must be even harder to forecast equity index returns without taking a view on some individual companies. It’s easy today to focus on whether the Magnificent Seven that have powered the S&P 500 rally — Apple, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta — might stumble. With more than a quarter of the US market’s valuation riding on them, the question is not at all trivial. But 30 years ago, five of these seven had not even listed. It’s hard to take a view on companies that don’t yet exist.   I’ve been as guilty as the next asset allocator in explaining my preference for US over European stocks or vice versa with reference to some domestic macroeconomic outlook. Given that financials, utilities and property groups will carry a strong domestic flavour, this is still forgivable.   But when constructing a long-term strategic asset allocation, it is becoming increasingly untenable to justify regional preferences with reference to local macroeconomic forecasts. This may explain why long-term return forecasts for equity markets — or Capital Market Assumptions, as they are known — have such a lousy record.   The biggest single investment decision any institutional or individual investor is likely to make in their portfolio is their choice of strategic asset allocation. To create a strategic asset allocation one must make reasonable guesses about future market returns. Bessembinder’s research shows quite how invariably such reasonable guesses will be blindsided by the fate of single stocks.";"1";"2023-08-08T14:11:15"
