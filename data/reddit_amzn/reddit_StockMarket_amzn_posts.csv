"Buy Apple & Amazon stocks now?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1537ug9/buy_apple_amazon_stocks_now/";"Hey guys,   a while ago, I bought Apple shares at $138 a piece and Amazon shares at $104 a piece. Then Amazon dropped to about $80 and Apple $137ish. I wanted to buy more but then I was afraid they both would go down resulting me in a great loss.   Fast forward now, Apple is $194 and Amazon $133. would it be worth for me to try to buy more Amazon and Apple shares or should I wait until they drop a bit?   Perhaps, should I take the money and buy ETFs or indexes like VOO ?  Your advise will be greatly appreciated.   I started investing back in 2021.   Thanks! ";"11";"2023-07-18T21:29:02"
"Amazon to replace Walgreens in Dow Jones Industrial Average";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1aw66dx/amazon_to_replace_walgreens_in_dow_jones/";"Amazon is set to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Walgreens Boots Alliance effective next week, S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Tuesday.  Adding Amazon will increase consumer retail exposure as well as other areas in the Dow, and the move was prompted by Walmart's decision to split its stock, S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a news release.  The Dow, which debuted in 1896, is widely followed by retail investors, making it an important reflection of the U.S. stock market. Institutional investors more frequently benchmark their performance against the S&P 500.  As well as dominating online retail, the Seattle company is a major player in cloud computing, entertainment and other industries.  The change takes effect at the open of trading on Monday (Feb-26-2024).  Walmart will remain part of the Dow, although its upcoming three-for-one stock split, effective after market close on Friday, will reduce that retailer's weight in the index.  The Dow is weighted based on the share prices of its components, not on each company's overall market value.

"Amazon has a P/E over 250x. Can someone explain this to me?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/13j582l/amazon_has_a_pe_over_250x_can_someone_explain/";"Earnings just came out, and it wasn't bad. In line with expectations. They made about $3b in profit. They obviously have a strong marketshare in cloud, and that isn't going anywhere any time soon. I can say this safely as a software dev. They could raise their prices 25% and I know that would not be enough to get the company I work for to switch to anything else.   That being said, a P/E of anything over 50x seems crazy to me. 250 would be for a smaller company, growing exponentially. What are people predicting about the future of Amazon that they should be worth so much? Their retail business is low margin, and that isn't changing any time soon.   Is there some sort of expectation of exponential growth in profit? I just really don't get it. This seems crazy overvalued to me, and people just buy Amazon because it's a big name and that's it. As good as AWS is, there shouldn't be any prediction of wild growth. If anything they could lose a little bit of market share going forward.   What am I missing here?";"35";"2023-05-16T15:27:03"

But here's the kicker – he's acknowledging that not everyone can easily snag a piece of the pie because, well, they're not exactly budget-friendly shares.   Cramer's wishing for stock splits to make these big players more accessible to the everyday investor, aka the ""home gamer."" He's also got a bone to pick with the bearish analysts and media raining on the parade.   Cramer's tackling concerns about Amazon Web Services slowing down, but he's not losing sleep over it. Amazon just dropped a collab bomb with NVIDIA, diving into software and generative artificial intelligence.   What are your thoughts on this? Do you agree with Cramer's call for more positivity in the media, or do you think the bears have a point?

"AMZN Q2 2023 Earnings Report";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/15hkh7n/amzn_q2_2023_earnings_report/";"   \*\* I'm for whatever reason, enjoying going through the documents and attempting to make it easier to digest and read. I just started doing this so any feedback would be appreciated. Goal is for a quick overview of the earnings report for an average person to be able to read and digest\*\*  1. Operating Activities:  The operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows showcases how Amazon generates cash from its core business operations. In both periods, the company's operating activities generated positive cash flow. There was a significant increase in net income, showing growth from a loss of $2.03 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. This highlights a remarkable improvement in Amazon's financial performance and operational efficiency.  2. Investing Activities:  Amazon invested heavily in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions during the analyzed periods. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, the company's investments in property and equipment amounted to $15.72 billion, which decreased to $11.45 billion in the same period in 2023. While the absolute values decreased, these investments are essential for the company's long-term growth and expansion.  3. Financing Activities:  The financing activities section details Amazon's capital structure and shareholder returns. The company engaged in various financing activities, including repurchasing common stock, resulting in cash outflows of $3.33 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2023, and $6 billion in the six months ending June 30, 2022. Additionally, the company obtained proceeds from short-term debt and other financing, contributing $4.87 billion and $4.4 billion in the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. Investors should be aware of these activities, as they impact the company's capital allocation strategy.  4. Cash Position:  Amazon maintained a strong cash position, reflecting its financial stability and liquidity. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased steadily over the periods, reaching $50.07 billion at the end of the twelve months ending June 30, 2023. This signifies the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations and pursue growth opportunities.  5. Debt and Interest Payments:  The company managed its debt obligations efficiently, making principal repayments on long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations. Amazon also paid interest on debt, with cash outflows totaling $349 million and $954 million for the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. These payments demonstrate responsible debt management and the company's commitment to meeting its financial obligations.  6. Net Sales:  Net sales are a fundamental indicator of Amazon's revenue growth and market performance. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, net sales reached $121.23 billion, which increased to $134.38 billion in the same period in 2023, representing an 11% year-over-year growth. Similarly, for the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net sales grew from $237.68 billion to $261.74 billion, showing strong and consistent revenue growth.  7. Operating Expenses:  Operating expenses provide insights into the company's cost structure and efficiency. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, operating expenses were $117.92 billion, which increased to $126.70 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating expenses increased from $230.69 billion to $249.29 billion, primarily due to higher fulfillment, technology, and infrastructure costs. Despite the increase, Amazon's revenue growth outpaced the rise in operating expenses, leading to improved operating income.  8. Operating Income:  Operating income measures the profitability of Amazon's core operations. The company experienced significant growth in operating income, increasing from $3.32 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to $7.68 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating income rose from $6.99 billion to $12.46 billion, indicating improved operational efficiency and profitability.  9. Non-Operating Expense:  The non-operating expense provides insights into Amazon's other income and expenses outside its core operations. Total non-operating expense decreased from ($5.97) billion to ($0.12) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. This decline was primarily due to a positive swing in other income (expense), net, indicating favorable financial management.  10. Net Income (Loss):  Net income is a critical metric that assesses Amazon's overall financial performance. The company experienced a significant improvement in net income, increasing from a loss of ($2.03) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net income increased from a loss of ($5.87) billion to a profit of $9.92 billion, demonstrating a strong financial turnaround.  11. Earnings Per Share (EPS):  Earnings per share is a vital metric for shareholders, as it represents the company's profitability on a per-share basis. Basic earnings per share increased from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.66 for the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. Diluted earnings per share showed similar growth, rising from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.65 for the same periods.  12. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss):  Other comprehensive income (loss) includes items that impact the company's financial position but are not part of the net income calculation. For the three months ending June 30, 2022, Amazon's other comprehensive income was ($2.42) billion, which increased to $293 million for the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, other comprehensive income was ($3.41) billion and $807 million, respectively.  13.

Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, comprehensive loss improved from ($9.28) billion to a comprehensive income of $8.33 billion, highlighting the company's financial recovery.  14. Segment Information:  Amazon operates through several segments, including North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, all segments showed significant growth in net sales.  • North America: Net sales in North America increased from $80.85 billion to $87.75 billion, representing a 9% year-over-year growth.  • International: Net sales in the International segment grew from $31.9 billion to $37.4 billion, reflecting a 17% year-over-year growth.  • AWS: Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud computing segment, experienced remarkable growth, with net sales increasing from $16.37 billion to $20.2 billion, showing a 23% year-over-year growth.  Conclusion:  Amazon demonstrated robust financial performance and growth in the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. The company's operating activities generated positive cash flow, and net sales increased consistently across all segments. Investments in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions reflect Amazon's focus on long-term growth and expansion.  Although the financing activities included cash outflows related to stock repurchases, the company's strong cash position and responsible debt management position Amazon well for future growth. The substantial improvement in net income and operating income signifies improved financial performance and operational efficiency.  PROs & CONs:  Pros:  • Strong Revenue Growth: Amazon has consistently demonstrated strong revenue growth across its various segments. The company's ability to expand its customer base, introduce new products and services, and leverage its e-commerce platform has led to impressive financial performance.  • Diversification of Business Segments: Amazon has successfully diversified its business beyond e-commerce. The expansion into cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been a major growth driver, providing the company with a stable and profitable source of revenue.  • Innovative and Customer-Centric Approach: Amazon's relentless focus on customer satisfaction, innovative technologies like Amazon Prime, and personalized shopping experiences have helped the company build a loyal customer base and maintain a competitive edge in the market.  • Financial Stability and Liquidity: The company maintains a strong cash position and prudent debt management, providing it with the financial flexibility to invest in new ventures and navigate economic uncertainties.  • Global Reach: Amazon operates in numerous countries, allowing it to tap into diverse markets and consumer preferences worldwide. Its vast international presence positions the company for further growth and market dominance.  • Leading Cloud Service Provider: AWS is a dominant force in the cloud computing industry, serving a wide range of clients, from startups to large enterprises. The profitability and growth of AWS contribute significantly to Amazon's overall financial success.  Cons:  • Regulatory Scrutiny: Amazon faces increasing regulatory scrutiny related to its market dominance and business practices. Antitrust concerns and accusations of unfair competition may lead to potential legal challenges and fines.  • Labor Practices: The company has faced criticism for its labor practices, including allegations of poor working conditions and treatment of employees at its fulfillment centers. Such negative publicity can impact Amazon's reputation and may affect its ability to attract and retain talent.  • Highly Competitive Markets: The e-commerce and cloud computing industries are highly competitive, with major players vying for market share. Amazon faces challenges from established competitors and emerging startups, requiring continuous investment in innovation and technology.  • Dependence on Global Supply Chain: Amazon's vast supply chain network is critical for delivering products to customers. Any disruptions, such as those caused by geopolitical events or natural disasters, could affect the company's operations and financial performance.  • Profit Margins: While Amazon experiences strong revenue growth, its profit margins have historically been relatively low. Intense competition and ongoing investments in new ventures can put pressure on the company's profitability.  • Environmental Impact: As a large-scale retailer and cloud services provider, Amazon's operations have an environmental impact. The company has faced criticism for its carbon footprint, and there are growing expectations from stakeholders for more significant efforts towards sustainability.  TLDR:  Amazon recent earnings report for the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, reveals a robust financial performance and impressive revenue growth across its segments. The company generated positive cash flow from operating activities, showing a significant increase in net income, indicating improved financial health and operational efficiency. Amazon's strategic investments in property, equipment, and acquisitions demonstrate a focus on long-term growth and expansion. With a strong cash position and responsible debt management, the company exhibits financial stability and flexibility. However, regulatory scrutiny, labor practices, and intense competition pose potential challenges. Despite these, Amazon remains a leading player in the e-commerce and cloud computing industries, presenting attractive prospects for investors seeking exposure to a market-dominant, innovative, and customer-centric company with a history of success and growth.";"33";"2023-08-04T02:04:45"

"New to the stock market, help me out";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/196nawg/new_to_the_stock_market_help_me_out/";"Hey guys, so i just turned 18 and i want to invest some of my saved money in stocks. Right now i have no idea though what app i should use. I’m living in Belgium and i’ve heard about apps like Robinhood, DeGiro, Bux and Trading 212. What app is the best and safest option? Also what if any of these apps just shut down, is all my money gone then? I also don’t really know what to invest in but I was thinking to maybe invest in VOO and SPY. Or should I maybe also invest in companies like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Nvidia. I’m also not really planning to withdraw money often from my account just start with €1000 and put in €50 every month and just let it grow. In case any of you have any more tips for me please leave them in the comments, I would greatly appreciate it.";"2";"2024-01-14T20:02:39"
"My top ideas for next couple weeks";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1bzv07m/my_top_ideas_for_next_couple_weeks/";"Best long term buying opportunity (not recommend calls but trickling in slowly as still expecting downside risk)  United Healthcare - expect more downside but its stock prices have been going down while earnings have gone up.  Good combination for accumulation  Alibaba - harder to recommend after the recent bounce which is why it was moved from my best call idea, which is more of a short term call list, to a long term hold list  Dow jones - it broke the 50 day moving average so more downside expected but it’s closest to fair value compared to Nasdaq and s and p  McDonald - I would have it on my call list if it wasn’t for the risk of not knowing how much of the California new wage for fast food worker is built into sentiment.  But good long term hold because finally valuations are getting better, dividend is decent, and people are selling the stock forgetting/ignoring that California is such a small portion of its global market   Best call ideas Apple -oversold and ready for short term bounce but not a recommended medium term hold.  Also good stock to trickle in slowly and be ready for lot more volatility   AMD - terrible valuation and company but oversold going into earning calls.  People love to buy up semiconductor stocks last couple weeks before the call.  Good hedge if you want to short the tech or s and p index.     Best short ideas Gold - purely technical.  Way overbought   Amazon - single most overvalued tech stock in the magnificent seven and that’s really saying something.  Biggest risk to the short thesis is the earning call and people not wanting to sell leading into it and instead dumping after, which is why I only have a small position in Amazon in case it does sell of early but saving a big cash pile for major puts if it spikes after earning  Microsoft - completely overhyped.  Nothing more to say.  Energy stocks (XLE) - I took some profits on my puts I bought on Friday but look for opportunity to enter shorts after small bounce.  The most overbought sector in the entire s&P and oil price is unsustainable    Overall statement on the conditions of the market  Be very vigilant as we had into earnings call.  While the market as a whole is still ridiculously overvalued, if earning calls are good enough stock market will ignore/forget the fact that they already ran up expecting the good news.  I anticipate very bumpy 3 weeks.  I see S and P within 1% of all time high and Nasdaq within 1.5% of all time high as excellent short entries and around 5050 on s and p and 435 on the QQQ as strategic places to place bets for short term rebound.  My recommendation is to keep playing those 2 ranges until one either breaks or until after earnings call in which case it’s safe to short the market to hearts content  ";"13";"2024-04-09T17:28:52"

Then again they probably said similar things in 2004. It just seems like GAFAM will continue to purchase any successful companies of smaller size.

I’ve been looking a bit about investing a little extra on my own. Now, is it worth finding a company that pays you dividends while you own their stocks? If so, how much is needed to invest to make a decent dividend? Or is it worth just investing into a good known company like apple or Amazon?    I tried investing a couple years ago when the hype was crazy and ended up loosing about $500 and gave up (similar to the GameStop trend). I definitely want something a bit more reliable and safe that can help some of my money grow because I don’t think my body or mind can make it to retirement alone.

Fund manager is BlackRock and risk score is 6 out of 7 i guess this is high because all these companies are the biggest in the world so i thought it would be more safer but this risk score i don’t know.

Technically speaking if we were to use discounted cash flow method, S&P should be at least 20% lower than 2022 Feb price of 4800 peak..   But if we use money supply theory then valuation does not matter, money was in excess supply after pandemic but stocks are in limited supply. Just like how homes are 30-40% higher than pre pandemic levels, we may have to assume stocks should be higher by similar amount due to effect of monetary inflation.  And not to forget that if Fed was to signal rate cuts markets will fly another 20% higher from current price.

"What Walmart’s ($WMT) stock split means for the Dow Jones.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1amq3cv/what_walmarts_wmt_stock_split_means_for_the_dow/";"Walmart recently announced a 3 for 1 stock split, a significant move considering its status as a major component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Since the Dow is a price-weighted index, this split will decrease Walmart’s weighting in the index, initiating a rebalance to accommodate the drop in price.  It's intriguing to note that the Dow has been trailing behind the S&P 500 in performance YTD, increasing ~2.6% and ~5.4% respectively.   Potentially prompting the index to consider adding new stocks to compensate for the YTD underperformance.  The last time the Dow underwent a significant change was in August 2020. At that time, Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell were added, while Exxon, Pfizer, and RTX Corp were removed.  Unlike their usual practices, the Dow committee has delayed making changes for an extended period of time, reminiscent of the period from June 2009 to September 2012.  With the Dow undergoing rebalancing, I’m eyeing potential exits for IBM, Cisco, Intel, Verizon, and Walgreens Boots Alliance.    Additionally, I could see potential additions like Amazon, META, and Eli Lilly who have a wider touch on the economy.  Which stocks do you predict might be on the way out, and which new additions do you foresee?";"0";"2024-02-09T16:02:01"

This early stage innovation will trickle down  into public markets sooner that expected.

First, I look at the momentum of SPY generally, if not I move into SVOL (VIX etf). 2. If there's positive SPY momentum, I then look at if tech is overbought or not (RSI >= 80). 3.

People's interest in intelligent language tool ChatGPT has quickly spread throughout the market, with prominent investors rushing to buy stocks of companies they believe can drive the rise of artificial intelligence.  Bill Gates has stated that AI could bring about a radical reshuffling in the tech industry, potentially threatening Google's market dominance, while Microsoft is making swift moves in the AI field. He expects that eventually, tech giants will integrate into applications similar to personal assistants, communicating with people and providing recommendations, replacing applications like Amazon, Siri, or Outlook. However, he points out that more work needs to be done to make AI tools like ChatGPT more accurate and objective.  In his past investments, Bill Gates has tended to invest in stable industries such as technology, healthcare, and energy. He has a deep insight into emerging technologies and future trends and invests in these areas. He emphasizes the importance of holding stocks for the long term and leans towards companies that have long-term growth potential.

Worrisome?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/15iwki0/the_buffett_indicator_model_signals_an_overvalued/";"The Buffett Indicator (aka, Buffett Index, or Buffett Ratio) is the ratio of the total United States stock market to GDP. As of July 31, 2023 the ratio is calculated as:  *Aggregate US Market Value: $48.97T*   *divided by*  *Annualized GDP: $26.91T*  ***= 182%***  The current ratio of 182% is approximately 51.35% (or about 1.7 standard deviations) above the historical trend line, suggesting that the stock market is Overvalued relative to GDP.  The last times the ratio was like this were in September 2000, August 2020 and April 2022. The question is whether the Buffett Indicator should really be seen as a warning signal or not, given the fact that the modern economy has seen a rise in technology companies and businesses with significant intangible assets, such as patents and intellectual property and these assets may not be adequately represented in the GDP, potentially skewing the results of the Buffett Indicator.

"Everything you need to know about GME's earnings today";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/16bscyw/everything_you_need_to_know_about_gmes_earnings/";"GameStop will be reporting earnings from the most recent quarter today, we're expecting a loss of $0.14 per share.  We all know what happened in 2021 with the short squeeze. In fact, there's a new movie called Dumb Money that's all about it. But this post isn't about that. It's about today's earnings and whether or not calls (or puts) are a good idea. The company has been losing money for years and needs a bullish catalyst to help it turnaround.  **Key Factors**  [GameStop in June fired its chief executive](https://fortune.com/2023/06/07/gamestop-fires-ceo-names-ryan-cohen-executive-chairman/), Matthew Furlong, an Amazon veteran who had been appointed [two years earlier](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-names-amazon-executives-as-its-new-ceo-cfo-11623270149?mod=article_inline&mod=article_inline). The company in June also said its board had elected activist investor Ryan Cohen, the co-founder of online pet-supplies retailer Chewy, as executive chair.  The [press release](https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-election-ryan-cohen-executive-chairman) announcing that move offered little detail. But GameStop, in a filing, said Cohen’s leadership would “further unlock long-term value creation for our stockholders.” The company said it appointed Mark Robinson as general manager and principal executive officer.  In July, GameStop said Chief Financial Officer Diana Saadeh-Jajeh would [resign on Aug. 11.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-says-its-cfo-is-resigning-b00cc9c1?mod=mw_quote_news&mod=article_inline) Daniel Moore, it said then, would become interim principal financial officer.  Cohen’s influence over GameStop has grown since 2020. Under his guidance, the company [last year put a bigger focus on physical stores](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-stores-ryan-cohen-f67d3871) after stumbles in its e-commerce push.  “The videogame industry grew in [the second quarter], but a continuing digital mix shift likely impacted GameStop traffic,” [Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter](https://www.wedbush.com/analysts/michael-pachter/) said in a research note not too long ago. Pachter, in this note, said that growth in hardware, or things like consoles, for companies like Nintendo and Sony, as well as a “compelling” lineup for new games and other software, indicated potential good news for GameStop’s results during the second quarter. But he pointed to “underwhelming” hardware sales from Microsoft and said GameStop “appears to have lost market share in recent quarters,” adding that its collectibles business — which includes items like toys and trading cards — faces difficult comparisons. He also noted the threat from a broader migration toward digital, mobile and subscription gaming.  “There were notable new game releases such as Activision’s *Diablo IV* and Nintendo’s *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom*, with the majority of sales likely occurring digitally,” Pachter said.  In Gamestop's [2022 annual report](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/fe325562-c087-4fad-809c-efd183364196), the company highlighted a plan to cut costs (especially in Europe), improve vendor relationships and penetrate higher margin markets like collectibles and toys.  Just as important as earnings is guidance, however the company has not provided this metric in recent quarters. Still, from my research I see that analysts believe that the company will report third-quarter revenue of $1.159 million — implying a YOY decline of 2.34% — and an adjusted EPS loss of 14 cents. For the full year of 2023, analysts expect $5.706 billion of revenue and an adjusted EPS loss of 26 cents.  This does suck for GME, unfortunately it's not looking very good for share holders. However, the popularity in DRS shares is rising. Retail shareholders have enthusiastically adopted the practice of using the Direct Registration System (DRS). For those who don't know, the DRS allows investors to hold their shares through the company's transfer agent, Computershare. It eliminates the need to entrust shares to a broker or to possess a physical stock certificate, as was customary in the past.  By contrast, when individuals allow brokers to hold their shares, they're kept under the brokerage's ""street name,"" rather than the investor's name. Brokers may then loan these shares to short sellers, who require access to the stock of the companies they are betting against.  GameStop's DRS numbers are growing, last earning report, [they revealed that](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/gme/gamestop-stock-76-6-million-shares-registered-holders-with-gmes-transfer-agent) 76.6 million shares were held by registered owners through Computershare. This indicates that around 25% of GameStop's outstanding shares were in the transfer agent's custody as of June 1. It also represents an increase of approximately 600,000 shares from the previous quarter. GameStop is likely among the companies with the most outstanding shares registered with its transfer agent. Since October 2021, GameStop's management has considered this information ""material"" and has included it in the company's quarterly filings. However, this isn't indicative of a positive or negative earning report today. It just shows the ""ape"" mentality regarding GME.   For those who like to trade options, I'm going to get puts on GME. However, those who are holding shares, it's best to sell today before close. This is *not* financial advice tho.";"0";"2023-09-06T20:47:11"

"Interested in how you found your strategy";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1anqoqs/interested_in_how_you_found_your_strategy/";"Hey everyone, I'm thrilled to be in a position where I can invest $4k monthly at the age of 19. However, with this exciting opportunity comes the challenge of deciding where to allocate my funds and which investment strategy to pursue. Currently, l've evenly split my investments between an investment account and a high-yield savings account, both of which have grown to close to $20k. However, I can't help but feel that I might be missing out on potential returns by keeping too much in the high yield savings account and lacking a clear investment strategy for stocks. When I first started investing at 18, I focused on stocks that seemed promising and affordable. However, i've come to realize that this may not be the most effective strategy. Now that I'm taking investing Investing more seriously, I'm eager to explore new strategies. Recently, l've been experimenting with purchasing VOO, but aside from that, I'm feeling a bit lost on where to go next. Here is a list of everything I hold:  • AAPL (Apple Inc.): 6 shares • AGOX (Adaptive Alpha Opportunity Fund): 14 shares • AMZN (Amazon.com, Inc.): 7 shares • BABA (Alibaba Group Holding Limited):6 shares • F (Ford Motor Company: 24 shares • FIS (Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.): 23 shares • GM (General Motors Co): 53 shares • INTC (Intel Corporation): 12 shares • PYPL (PayPal Holdings, Inc.): 14 shares • SOFI (SoFi Technologies, Inc.): 53 shares • T (AT&T Inc.): 142 shares • TMUS (T- Mobile US, Inc.): 5 shares • VOO (Vanguard -20 Index Fund): 5 shares • T (AT&T Inc.): 142 shares • TMUS (T-Mobile US, Inc.): 5 shares • VOO (Vanguard 500 Index Fund): 5 shares • VXUS (Vanguard Total International Stock ETF): 5 shares Overall, I've achieved a 13% return with an 8% yearly return on my personal investment account. I'd greatly appreciate any thoughts or suggestions on how I can refine my investment strategy and optimize my portfolio for better long-term growth. Your advice and insights u V be incredibly valuable to me. Thanks in advance for your help!";"9";"2024-02-10T22:18:49"

"Building a portfolio for my cousin (25M) need suggestion";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/14ljyd6/building_a_portfolio_for_my_cousin_25m_need/";" Hey guys, I'm building a portfolio for my cousin who lives in the US. The primary goal is growth and the risk level is medium. I don't know much about US ETFs, but here's a list of ETFs and stocks I've picked for him. Let me know what you think I should add or change. He's 25, and it's more of a buy weekly/bi-weekly and come back in 3 - 5 years.  Picks:  * VOO - Tracks the performance of the 500 biggest US companies. * VUG - Tracks U.S. large-cap growth companies. It provides investors with diversified exposure to stocks of companies that are expected to have higher-than-average growth rates. * AAPL - Apple  * TD - Always good to have at least one bank for diversification * AMZN - Amazon  I know VOO and VUG overlap, especially with AAPL and AMZN, but I want him to have 2 primary ETFs and 3 to 4 stocks. I was thinking of adding SHOP too. I did take out NVDA and TSLA.";"0";"2023-06-28T22:19:33"

"Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/19esa5z/why_am_i_bullish_on_sfy_instead_of_spy/";"A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings:  https://preview.redd.it/evtbd2dnkgec1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=47c5c6d9f58e6997aad5330dba32ff543e2c8541  Data Sources:  * SPY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/spy/holdings/)​​, [Schwab](https://www.schwab.wallst.com/schwab/Prospect/research/etfs/schwabETF/index.asp?type=holdings&symbol=SPY)​​, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/?guccounter=1)​​. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST)​ * SFY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/sfy/holdings/)​​, [Zacks.com](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/SFY/holding)​​, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SFY/holdings/)​​. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST)  **Key Observations:**  * Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. * Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. * Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting.  It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation.  I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors:  1. **Expense Ratio**: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. 2. **Stock Selection Methodology**: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. 3. **Performance Trends**: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. 4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. 5. **Market Positioning**: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. 6. **Innovative Approach of SoFi**: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.  It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.  **What are your thoughts?**";"0";"2024-01-24T22:46:21"

"What has made stock markets in the last 2 decades to be less fundamentally focused?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/14abbql/what_has_made_stock_markets_in_the_last_2_decades/";"So I’m 21, and it seems like the entire duration of my life, stock markets have ceased to be driven by fundamentals, and it seems to be driven by momentum, FOMO and occasionally straight fear. The market now seems to be filled with periods of irrational exuberance and steep downturns with little inbetween. Why? There is little time where buyers and sellers are in check and an efficient consensus has been reached on how much an asset should be priced.  It seemed back when investing and markets in general were logical, growth was maybe number 4 on the totem pole of impotence for an investor to consider. Growth is obviously important but these days it’s the *only* thing that’s important. Why?  What exactly changed to make the stock market a slower cycle, with lower highs and lower lows, to an extremely volatile, non fundamental driven machine? Bubbles have been around since the 17th century or earlier, but what event, explicitly has made them more common, when you’d expect the number of asset bubbles to decrease quadratically upon one’s lifetime?  Is it just that market participants are not humans anymore(99.9% of them)? Robots don’t care about fundamentals and they just want to squeeze every penny out of something? Technology? Artificially low interest rates? I just want to know what exactly caused this change in markets. If it’s just computers, why does Bloomberg and CNBC say “investors don’t care about X stock market soars” instead of “algorithms don’t care…”? It implies normal people are the ones seriously engaging in asset inflation.  I understand that the market is in a Peroid of irrational exuberance, just like how in 2020 it was in a Peroid of unbound fear, unfortunately I turned 18 after the market already reached new highs.  Thank you for whatever answers you may provide, I understand this is a nuanced issue.  To me, and I’m not majoring in anything related to this, it seems with the technology it should be easy to value these things in a way that’s fair to both buyers and sellers. At the end of the day these are just stocks, not your first born they’re not invaluable. It’s a little confusing I guess to someone studying to be a structural engineer.";"0";"2023-06-15T21:43:06"

"Shopify ($SHOP) delivers impressive earnings, enticing investors to consider buying the stock.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/13lm704/shopify_shop_delivers_impressive_earnings/";"   ## Shopify's Q1 earnings call contained a major surprise.  The e-commerce landscape is dominated by behemoths like **Amazon** and **Walmart**. However, there are a number of rising players that have made inroads. One of them is **Shopify** **(****SHOP** **0.15%)**. If you have ever clicked on an advertisement on Facebook or Instagram and subsequently made a purchase, chances are you've checked out using Shopify.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, Shopify boomed in popularity. It's no secret that the pandemic was a catalyst for online shopping and the creation of side hustles (monetizing a hobby). During this period, Shopify's offering was in high demand, and subsequently, the financial profile of the company seemingly changed overnight.  It should be noted that Shopify's infrastructure is designed for businesses of all sizes, and not just small or medium businesses (SMBs). For example, Tesla uses Shopify as does PepsiCo, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and Nestle.  Furthermore, large consulting firms like Deloitte and enterprises such as **IBM** have strategic agreements with the e-commerce company as systems-integrated partners.  Like many other businesses, Shopify's operating results have started to normalize in a post-pandemic world and shares are up roughly 70% this year as of the time of this article, although they still are down about 65% from all-time highs in November 2021. Let's dig into the company's first-quarter results and assess if it's trading at a reasonable valuation and deserves a look for your portfolio.     ## Shopify's Q1 at a Glance  During Shopify's fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call, management offered the following outlook for the first quarter of 2023:  * Revenue growth in the high-teen percentages year over year: * Gross margins to be slightly higher quarter over quarter.  Per the company's Q1 earnings release, Shopify's revenue grew by 25% (and 27% on a constant-currency basis) to $1.5 billion. And its gross margin was 47.5%, up from 46% in Q4.So it's safe to say that Shopify exceeded its own forecast.  Another metric to analyse is the company's operating expenses. For the quarter, Shopify's operating expenses totalled $910 million, up 24% year over year. That increase was mainly driven by salaries and wages, including those of the company's Deliver employees, a business that Shopify is now selling just a year after buying it.  While Shopify blew away its revenue forecast, investors should be keenly aware that the company's combined annual growth for the cost of goods sold and operating expenses outweighed its revenue growth. For this reason, Shopify reported an operating loss of $193 million, nearly double its operating loss in Q1 2022. Yet despite these operating losses, Shopify reported a net income of $68 million, or $0.05 in earnings per share (EPS).    By contrast, Shopify reported a net loss of $1.5 billion ($1.17 EPS) for Q1 2022. This was due to a $1.6 billion net unrealized loss on equity and other investments.  Shopify owns stakes in other companies, and when these stocks experience volatility in either direction, it must factor those unrealized gains or losses relative to the cost basis for each investment into its bottom line. It should be noted that in Q1 2023, Shopify booked a net unrealized gain of $269 million, more than enough to overcome the operating loss.    Overall, these financial results look like a mixed bag to me. I am quite impressed by the revenue growth. However, Q1 clearly illustrated that the Deliver integration, and its associated costs, were a drag on the core business. After a year of rising costs and slow integration efforts, it's no wonder Shopify decided to pull the plug and divest these logistics assets to Flex port. While Shopify is also undergoing cost reductions in the form of layoffs, I question if a consistent path to profitability is viable.     ## Didn't see this coming  Although Shopify beat Wall Street's expectations, I think the *real* cause of its post-earnings stock surge was the surprise announcement that the company is selling its logistics assets to Flexport, a leader in that niche.  Remember, it was only last May that Shopify acquired the logistics and fulfillment company Deliverr. The thesis behind the deal was to layer Deliverr's merchant solutions on top of Shopify's fulfillment network (SFN) infrastructure. But over the last year, management has been updating investors about its integration efforts. Namely, Shopify's management made it clear that the extra costs associated with building out SFN will have a *dilutive* impact on the company's margin profile.   While it may be uncomfortable to admit, Shopify's Q1 results show that it has overhead bloat, driven mainly by added headcount from Deliverr. The divestiture helps Shopify cut labor other non-core operating expenses related to its logistics business.      ## Is the stock a buy?  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/ejok5t214q0b1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=07eb3d2aa3cc50571a3de7cb8c4eb82190d7c22e     In my opinion, there is more than meets the eye here. When it comes to logistics, Amazon is a juggernaut and it took decades to get there. Plain and simple, Shopify does not have the financial flexibility or the technical know-how to compete. On the surface, selling the logistics assets seems like a smart and responsible move for Shopify.   After the earnings call, analysts at several Wall Street institutions, among them **Goldman Sachs**, **Citigroup**, **Morgan Stanley**, and Piper Sandler, revised their price targets for Shopify.  Citigroup is the most bullish with a price estimate of $65 per share, implying roughly 8% upside from a recent price of about $60. By contrast, Piper Sandler modeled an intrinsic value of $50 per share or 17% downside. Goldman and Morgan Stanley have price estimates of $59 and $54 per share, respectively. The common theme among the banks is that all have neutral or neutral-equivalent ratings.  Shopify is not yet consistently profitable, which makes traditional valuation metrics such as price-to-earnings or the price/earnings-to-growth ratio less useful. One metric that can help is price-to-sales (P/S). Shopify is currently trading at 13 times its trailing-12-month revenue. P/S ratios vary by industry. But a general rule of thumb is to compare P/S ratios among competitors in the same industry. Given that comparable companies such as Amazon and Walmart are much larger, mature businesses, it's not necessarily fair to judge Shopify's P/S ratio because it's still a growth company, which as a group tends to have high ratios.    I personally do not like stocks when momentum is pushing them up. As a long-term investor, I am not looking to buy on perceived good news and sell on an upswing to book a quick gain. The most prudent action for investors is likely to assess Q2 earnings and digest how the Flexport deal is going. While Shopify has built a credible operation, the company faces an uphill battle, particularly with Amazon. There is definitely money to be made in Shopify stock, but it's volatility and underlying business fundamentals are enough for me to look elsewhere, and based on the available metrics it doesn't seem to be trading at a reasonable level.";"1";"2023-05-19T07:36:43"
"Apple becomes first U.S. company to reach $3 trillion market cap";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1493cw8/apple_becomes_first_us_company_to_reach_3/";"   * **Apple hit a market cap of $3 trillion briefly during trading on Monday.** * **The milestone is mostly symbolic but it represents investor recognition of Apple’s success over the past few years as the company has reported several record-breaking quarters of big growth in all of its product lines.** * **Apple’s cash flow also makes the stock a safe haven during times of market uncertainty.**  Apple briefly hit a market cap of $3 trillion during intraday trading on Monday, before dropping back under the mark shortly afterwards. Apple broke the barrier when its share price hit $182.86.  Apple rose 2.5% on Monday to close at $182.01, just missing closing the trading day at the $3 trillion mark.   The milestone is mostly symbolic but it shows investors remain bullish on Apple stock and its ability to grow. At a market value of $3 trillion, Apple tripled its valuation in under four years. And analysts see plenty of room to run.  Apple showed annual growth across all of its product categories in its fourth-quarter earnings, with revenue up 29% year-over-year. While the iPhone is still the biggest sales driver, Apple’s services business grew 25.6% year-over-year and delivered more than $18 billion in revenue during the quarter.   In December, for example, Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty raised the firm’s price target on Apple from $164 to $200, and maintained the equivalent of a buy rating, arguing that new products like virtual reality and augmented reality headsets aren’t yet baked into the share price.  Huberty also said she expects Apple’s App Store revenue to outperform Morgan Stanley’s forecasts for the quarter and for Apple to ship 83 million units during the December quarter, 3 million more than anticipated.  Apple sold 27 million pairs of its newest AirPods model over the holidays, driving 20% year-over-year growth for Apple’s wearables business during the quarter, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TFI Asset Management Limited said in a Monday note.  Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote on Sunday that the mark is a “watershed moment” but has more room to grow, especially since Ives values Apple’s services business at $1.5 trillion.  Investors also turned to Apple as a safe haven during recent market uncertainty, thanks to its strong balance sheet and prodigious cash flow, which it uses to invest in new products, stock buybacks and to return capital to shareholders through dividends.  Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to hit a $1 trillion market cap during intraday trading on Aug. 2, 2018. It hit a $2 trillion valuation just over two years later on Aug. 19, 2020.  Apple’s peers aren’t far behind. Microsoft is worth about $2.5 trillion, Amazon has about a $1.75 market cap and Google’s market valuation is just shy of $2 trillion.  Apple stock rose 34% in 2021.";"138";"2023-06-14T11:30:13"

"Total noob looking for a little help";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/15ii0sf/total_noob_looking_for_a_little_help/";"Hey all  So as the title states I'm a total newb to trading in general really. I do feel I have an alright understanding of how to evaluate a stock to some degree of success. However I'm having trouble using that evaluation to accurately predict how a stock is going to react. Obviously there is no exact science to this stuff but I just need to be a little more consistent.   So looking at two stocks this morning during pre-market. AMZN and DKNG, both beat fairly well on earnings. My initial thought process was okay both beat on earnings and both have gapped up a fair amount during extended hours trading, I would think they would continue the breakout maybe after a slight pullback at the open. However AMZN consolidated and eventually it gradually climbs to 143.63 then again gradually sells off throughout the day. Okay makes sense. DKNG however just dumps right off the open and continues to fall throughout the day quite sharply with a couple slight pullbacks, it falls all the way to about 30.38.  So I Googled around a bit trying to figure out why a stock that just posted good earnings would drop off like that. Most common answer I seemed to find was it's more about forward guidance than the actual current earnings. Okay that makes sense. So I went back and looked at both companies guidance for earnings next quarter on TradingView. Both are projected to post worse earnings next quarter than they just posted.   So based on that I would think both of them should take a bit of a dive no? This is where I'm confused. Why would they behave so differently? I'm still very much learning the ""market psychology"" so to speak and maybe that is where I'm going wrong? Genuinely trying to and interested in learning so any insight or advice anyone can offer would be much appreciated.  As a side note if there are any learning resources you found really helped you when starting out would you mind sharing? :)  Thanks in advance!";"5";"2023-08-05T03:19:49"

I have done a few 7 day free trials and they were actually decent and somewhat informative. The price was a bit high for the trials that I tried out so I cancelled but I think it can be worth it sometimes if the analysis is well researched or it brings something to my attention - maybe a new drug is going to release results soon for a disease for example but its not really known but has a big market.

"Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/18s3rvu/magnificent_7_and_friends_contributed_75_of_sp/";"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing =  &#x200B:  The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023  [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9)  &#x200B:  The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions.  &#x200B:  It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post.  &#x200B:  The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%.  &#x200B:  The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%.  &#x200B:  Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%.  &#x200B:  Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said.  &#x200B:  That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote.  &#x200B:  Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found.  &#x200B:  Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July.  &#x200B:  The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said.  &#x200B:  The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering.  &#x200B:  SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown.  &#x200B:  Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78%  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%,  [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. AMZN, 0.16%,  Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%,  Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%,  Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%,  and Meta Platforms Inc.  META, 0.56%.  &#x200B:  See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024?  &#x200B:  Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind.  &#x200B:  The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.  &#x200B:  In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high:  &#x200B:  The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted.  &#x200B:  Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.";"11";"2023-12-27T16:52:27"

"The Rise of Data Centers: An Alternative to NVDA’s Dominance in the AI Market.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1525xgb/the_rise_of_data_centers_an_alternative_to_nvdas/";"Wall Street Awakens to New Opportunities Amidst Overvaluation Concerns and NVDA’s Vulnerabilities  In recent times, the technology landscape has been dominated by the impressive growth and innovation of companies like Nvidia (NVDA), which have become synonymous with artificial intelligence (AI) advancements. However, a new contender has emerged, challenging the notion that NVDA is the sole option for investors seeking exposure to the AI market. Data centers, once considered a supporting player, are now positioning themselves as formidable alternatives with the potential to not only rival but surpass the computing power of NVDA. This article explores the rise of data centers and the vulnerabilities of NVDA, shedding light on the implications they pose for investors amidst concerns of NVDA’s overvaluation on Wall Street.  The Alternative Powerhouses: Data centers have traditionally served as the backbone of cloud computing, storing vast amounts of information and providing processing capabilities to various industries. However, with the exponential growth of AI applications, data centers have evolved into powerhouses capable of supporting complex computational tasks and training neural networks. Unlike NVDA, which primarily focuses on semiconductors, data centers possess the infrastructure, scalability, and dedicated resources required to handle the intensive computing demands of AI algorithms. They are now ready to challenge NVDA’s dominance in terms of computing power and offer a more diverse investment opportunity in the semiconductor market.  Overvaluation Concerns and Market Perception: The buzz surrounding NVDA’s achievements has led to concerns of overvaluation as investors rush to invest in what was once considered the primary AI play. The stock’s valuation has skyrocketed, raising questions about its sustainability. However, market perceptions are shifting, driven by the emergence of data centers as a compelling alternative. Savvy investors are recognizing the potential benefits of diversifying their portfolios and exploring opportunities beyond NVDA, which could protect them from the risks associated with an overvalued stock.  The Shift in Market Dynamics: The financial landscape is dynamic and ever-evolving, with market sentiment and trends constantly shifting. The growing recognition of data centers as a powerful alternative to NVDA signals a potential turning point in the AI market. As the market becomes saturated with NVDA investments, the demand for alternative investment opportunities is expected to surge.  Blackstone’s Strategic Focus: Notably, Blackstone, a prominent player in the investment landscape, has already made a decisive move in favor of data centers. Recognizing the changing and highly competitive nature of the semiconductor sector, Blackstone has chosen to prioritize investments in data centers. This strategic shift underscores their confidence and foresight, as they find valuations more favorable and growth more prominent in the data center market.  Investing in Data Centers: A Viable Strategy? Given the increasing competitiveness of data centers, investors seeking exposure to the AI market may find it wise to explore this emerging sector. Data centers provide a robust and diversified approach, offering access to a range of companies harnessing AI capabilities. By investing in data centers, individuals can capitalize on the growing demand for AI-driven computing power while mitigating the risks associated with NVDA’s vulnerabilities and potential overvaluation.  Conclusion: The dominance of NVDA in the AI market is no longer assured, as data centers rise to prominence and challenge its position. While NVDA has undoubtedly been at the forefront of AI advancements, the emergence of data centers as a formidable alternative cannot be ignored. Investors are increasingly recognizing the value of diversifying their portfolios and exploring alternative opportunities beyond NVDA’s potential overvaluation. Wall Street is awakening to the vulnerabilities of NVDA and the immense potential of data centers, which are poised to reshape the investment landscape and provide a broader array of opportunities in the AI market. Blackstone’s strategic focus on data centers further solidifies their importance in the shifting technological landscape.";"3";"2023-07-17T17:59:44"

"A Post-Earnings Review of Alphabet (GOOG)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/15bbp1h/a_postearnings_review_of_alphabet_goog/";"I'm a big fan of making things more visual rather than a whole lot of text, so here's a rundown of some key things from Alphabet's latest earnings.   # The Cloud Market Share  First up, cloud market share. Conveniently, Microsoft released numbers as well this week so we can lump Azure into this. Amazon has not yet given us an update on AWS, but we should get that next week. For now, here's a breakdown of how the Cloud market stacks up.   [AWS vs Azure vs Google Cloud](https://preview.redd.it/ujdyz4xqakeb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=77900a753697eb52ba6a328f5a219b3a9a10b1d4)  It should be noted that Microsoft does not break Azure out from a whole lot of other tools, I've assumed it's around two-thirds of ""Intelligent Cloud"" today. It could easily be +/- $5B from that $58.9B figure, but there's no confirmation of that.   Over time, Google Cloud and Azure are closing the gap on AWS. It's worth noting that the size of the pie is growing considerably, so AWS is still growing at a good pace, just Azure and Google Cloud have been growing a lot better recently.   &#x200B:  [AWS vs Google Cloud vs Azure over time](https://preview.redd.it/yqwy50b7bkeb1.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bf590948c039ac062ab41933ebb8a66bf8aa53a)  # YouTube vs Netflix  YouTube once again saw some decent advertising growth and it got me thinking... it's bigger than Netflix, right? Turns out it's pretty close on just advertising alone.   &#x200B:  [Netflix Streaming vs YouTube Ad Revenue](https://preview.redd.it/hr8y9fdfbkeb1.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&s=349f7763c9324eaf86297a208f4fbdde7fe50788)  Alphabet does not break out YouTube Premium subscription numbers, but once can be sure that the tally puts YouTube higher than Netflix streaming on a revenue basis. So, the next time Disney+ versus Max vs Netflix is brought up in a ""King of Streaming"" battle, just know that YouTube is sat quietly dominating in the background.   # Google Cloud's Profitable Year  Finally, Google Cloud is on track for a profitable year on an operating basis. It's not done that before, but the past two quarters have both been positive setting the stage for the company's first profitable year of cloud services.   &#x200B:  [Google Cloud operating income](https://preview.redd.it/gf92055ybkeb1.png?width=1316&format=png&auto=webp&s=febfa54c41fdbab7d96f035a52b3aa9c90c892c7)  # Suggestions / Requests?

"SP500 Futures TA for 8/2/23";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/15fne0p/sp500_futures_ta_for_8223/";" *I share my plan for educational purposes and discussion and it is not intended as trade recommendations or ideas.*  ***Recap***: In the plan for today I wrote that *“a sustained breakout above* ***4609-20*** *would signal that a new trend leg is developing”*. This level was tested but not taken out overnight and so what looked like a potential breakout at yesterday’s close again failed and kept the market in a tight range.   In said in the plan that I 'm viewing **4596** support. In the premarket session, the market tested below this level and recovered it, and I got long just after the market opened today. I exited the majority of the trade at **4609**, the next resistance level from the plan, and the last contract was taken out at breakeven. For as tight a range as the market is in, I’m happy to get a win at all. The market proceeded to retest **4596** and even towards the other support level from yesterday’s educational section, but really didn’t go anywhere.  ***Balance/Trend***: The market has been in the balance area since July 18: I have defined this region as **4559-4609**, and added an additional level at **4620** to capture the drift we’ve seen at the highs when the market has tried breaking above 4609. Since Friday, this has tightened further and there is no predominant recent trend. Core trends, ones that span weeks or months or more, are all still pointing up.   ***Analysis***: Today’s action was more of what we’ve come to expect in balanced markets and indeed is the reason why I always track the balance and trend in the section above. In yesterday’s newsletter, I highlighted the fact that the market continues to balance within the upper distribution of the Friday profile and today’s low keeps that bit of analysis relevant.  In the near term, I would watch for bulls to hold the market above **4589** (and **4582** at the lowest) to keep their near-term momentum . A failure here raises the odds that the market moves back to the balance area lows at **4559**. Whatever happens though, it’s clearly a choppy consolidation until some sort of trend resumes (above **4609-20** or below **4559**). With jobs figures due the rest of this week and Apple and Amazon reporting on Thursday, volatility could/should be just ahead.   ***Plan***  * There are several support levels that I’m watching that are bunched together, as they often are in these environments: **4573**, **4579-82, 4589, 4596**. These were all covered in greater detail elsewhere, but given their proximity and the choppy conditions, trading these could be very difficult. As usual, I am following my guidelines to get confirmation and exit the trade at the next level * One potential support that I’m watching is at **4562**, a spot where the market previously saw strong buying. Ideally the market would test **4559** first and bounce from there for me to get long at this level * If the market were to lose the balance area lows, I would be hesitant to trade counter to that trend, though a spot to watch for a support trade would be at **4542-45** * Other potential support levels are **4529**, **4494-97**, **4479, 4472**, **4466** * Again, the market would really need to clear **4620** to convince me of a breakout, and even then I rarely chase them. My preference would be a breakout and retest, perhaps down to about **4616**,  to signal a long * There is potential resistance at **4636**, where I added a second aqua trendline to better reflect recent market action. The core level from that channel is at \~**4662** * The next spot for resistance is **4683** and comes from the yellow trend channel, which I recently added to connect the October ‘22 and March ‘23 lows  https://preview.redd.it/o7ver5pi3kfb1.png?width=1714&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffe4133de72f78b6181ecb263e788b9e8feb3131";"1";"2023-08-01T22:12:42"

"Worse case scenario: the perfect Bear cocktail";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1aq1g2o/worse_case_scenario_the_perfect_bear_cocktail/";"After reading all the comments from my last post and doing some more thinking. I decided to entertain the idea of what would be the perfect Bear cocktail that could trigger a Stock Market destabilization. I'm not taking into account any type of positive news. I'm simply going the negative route, in a slow and systematic manner, without any huge trigger events.  What am I missing and at what dates that's important and could also add to this?  If you notice in the prior post list, three out of six times... rising interest rates were part of the cause that brought the market down at least 20%. Oil price shocks two out of 6. Then there´s speculative investments at the dotcom bubble. Covid, overvaluation, trade tensions... Stagflation. So these have to be in the mix one way or another:     Cocktail Potential Ingredients:   1. Rising interest rates.   2. Oil price shocks.   3. Speculative tech investments.   4. Overvaluation.   5. Trade tensions.   6. Stagflation.   7. New round of Covid-19.   8. Housing or Commercial Real Estate Bubble.     So this is the speculative worse case scenario we could have without going as far as having a WWIII:     February 13, 2024: CPI report comes in hot. S&P500 comes down 1.5%, some buy the tiny dip.   February 15, 2024: Jobless claims rise. Doesn't alter the market but adds to the cocktail mix.  February 16, 2024: A higher-than-expected PPI indicates increasing costs at the producer level, which can signal rising inflationary pressures. Producers might pass these higher costs onto consumers, leading to an increase in consumer prices and overall inflation. The Fed to consider tightening monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to combat inflation. This could include raising interest rates or adjusting the pace of tapering asset purchases.  Financial markets don't react negatively to a higher-than-expected PPI, as it they priced it in from the CPI report.   February 21, 2024: Nvidia posts earnings, they actually do fine but investors realize that´s gonna be the ceiling for now so the stock falls 15%. Other tech stocks get stained by the fear, bringing the S&P500 2.5% lower. AI investment sentiments leans towards potentially speculative for now.  March 12, 2024: February´s CPI report comes in hot again, causing Algorithmic trades to sell and bring down the S&P500 another 2%.  March 19-20, 2024: FOMC Meeting gives subtext of potentially not bringing interest rates down yet. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterates emphasis on the central bank's commitment to combating inflation, even if it requires keeping interest rates high for an extended period. This brings down the market sentiment down and numbers another 1%.   April 5, 2024:  In a CNBC YouTube video report, experts delve into the complexities of the current commercial real estate (CRE) market. The rise of remote work led to a decreased demand for office spaces, the pandemic trained people to make purchases online, commercial real estate bubble starts to show symptoms of cracking up.   April 10, 2024: CPI report is on ambiguous. Not up, not down. Anything could happen at this point. Aprils report will define what the FED will do and the next 6 months of stock market activity. Market loses .5%  April 17, 2024: Tom Lee's bullish perspective has been challenged by the prior events and during an interview he mentions that this was the turmoil he had been expecting but sees the S&P500 going back to 5,200 points by the end of the year. Currently at 4,600... 7.5% below all time highs.  May 1, 2024: FOMC Meeting leaves a bad taste in mouth. Jerome shifts narrative towards not lowering interests rates yet. Market falls another 2.5% on the bad sentiment.  May 15, 2024:  Situations in the Middle East, such as tensions in Gaza or Iran, could impact global oil supplies by affecting regional stability and energy infrastructure. Saudi Arabia, a key OPEC member, might alter its oil production strategy in response to shifts in global politics, economic pressures, or changes in energy demand. Actions perceived as irrational could stem from strategic decisions to protect national interests, influence oil prices, or respond to international events. S&P500 falls 0.5%.  July 8, 2024: A new wave of Covid-19 actually breaks through the collective deceit of it being over because death rates rise significantly and word spreads out again from hospital staff that's it's getting real bad. Stock market reacts in a mixed manner. Amazon and tech companies go up a little, small caps enter another bad rout. S&P500 falls 1%.  July 20, 2024: Numbers start to confirm a Stagflation situation actually taking place. A significant slowdown in economic growth, rising unemployment rates, declining consumer spending, and a contraction in manufacturing. Inflation pressures, coupled with tightening monetary policies aimed at controlling price levels, contribute to decreased economic activity. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions serve as catalysts, further straining global markets. The interconnectedness of these factors in precipitate a recessionary environment. S&P500 falls .7%.  July 23, 2024: Nvidia reports and disappoints, falls another 8% in tandem with other tech companies.  July 25, 2024: Commercial Real Estate bubble pops and hits the news hard. S&P500 falls 1.4% At 13.6% the all time highs from January 2024. Currently at 4,400 points.  August 14, 2024: After all the earnings reports it becomes increasingly clear: the FED won't lower rates and will keep them there for longer than expected: consumer spending is declining, companies keep firing people, the Bear narrative takes over. The S&P500 falls to 4,010 points. 23.5% below all time highs. It stays around here for the next 6 months, falls further and gets better by the end of 2025.   ";"13";"2024-02-13T20:00:48"
"Investment plan for about 85 000$ USD over the coming year";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1521zl5/investment_plan_for_about_85_000_usd_over_the/";"So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years.  I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030.  However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now.  I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices.  The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (**European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ** \- I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of **Norwegian dividend stocks** (Done)-Buy shares in **AMD** for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in **Alphabet** ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin **Tesla Corp** TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in **TSMC** TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to **bank account** I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time)  Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco **S&P 500 UCITS ETF** Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE **China UCITS ETF** FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE **India UCITS ETF** FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering **Apple** APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering **Microsoft** MSF, **Meta** FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering **Amazon** (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-**Berkshire Hathaway Class B** BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering **Palantir** PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered **Nvidia** (FOMO)-Considered **IBM** and **Intel** as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)  So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?  Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)";"0";"2023-07-17T15:28:09"
"Top Tech stocks to consider: Unlocking high potential investments for Tech enthusiasts";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/13vmjy6/top_tech_stocks_to_consider_unlocking_high/";"## A combination of recent performance, future opportunities, and attractive valuations makes these stocks compelling right now.  Despite the recent sell-off of tech stocks, this sector is still a favourite among investors -- and for good reason. Technology companies are fun and exciting to learn about and follow, and many of their products are consumer-facing favourites of many investors.  In the current higher-interest-rate environment, the price paid for stocks matters more than it has in recent history. With that in mind, there are some stocks that are still trading for reasonable or cheap valuations that present attractive buying opportunities right now. Let's take a look at three of those stocks to see what makes them great buys.  ## PayPal  For many years, the story of **PayPal** **(PYPL** **1.43%)** was one of expansion, with revenue growth averaging around 17% each quarter. More recently, management decided to prioritize increasing the activity of its existing customers. The recent results show that this may have been a wise decision.  One example is how much more valuable each account has become to PayPal's bottom line. In the first quarter of 2023, active accounts remained relatively stable year over year, while transactions per active account have increased by 13%. This is proof that the focus on driving higher activity levels on existing accounts is paying off.  ## DigitalOcean  The leaders in cloud infrastructure are household names. **Amazon** Web Services (AWS), **Alphabet**'s Google Cloud, and **Microsoft**'s Azure are the clear leaders in the space. However, smaller upstart **DigitalOcean** (**DOCN** **4.99%)** is not only holding its own, but it's also growing faster than its tech giant competitors.   DigitalOcean caters to small and medium-sized businesses by offering affordable and transparent pricing as well as substantial customer support. This strategy has been paying off. In Q1 2023, DigitalOcean grew its revenue by 30% year over year, outpacing its competition. For comparison, AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure increased by 16%, 28%, and 27%, respectively.  DigitalOcean is also growing its largest customers even more rapidly than its revenue. Customers that spend more than $50 per month, called ""builders and scalers,"" increased by 43% year over year. These customers now represent 86% of total revenue. This is an important metric to keep an eye on as it is an indicator of how DigitalOcean is able to continue to serve its customers as they grow and scale.  The company has only been on the public markets for a few years, but it's currently trading for valuation multiples below its historical average and not far from its all-time lows.  ## Endava  **Endava** (**DAVA** **2.53%)** may not be a household name for investors, but it should be. This IT consulting company has been putting up impressive numbers despite the fact that its stock is down 34% year to date and down 70% from its late 2021 high.  Third-quarter 2023 results, which represent the quarter ending in March, were impressive with revenue and earnings per share increasing by 20% year over year. Endava is also consistently cash flow positive, and it generated a 10% free cash flow margin for the quarter.   Endava has been growing its roster of large customers impressively. The number of clients spending more than 1 million British pounds ($1.24 million) in revenue reached 155 in Q3, an increase of 31% year over year. The overall customer base is also becoming more diversified. Endava's top-10 clients represented 33% of total revenue in Q3, down from 35% in the year-ago quarter.  The stock took a hit after earnings, mostly due to the fact that the company lowered its fiscal 2023 guidance. However, management thinks that slowing revenue from the private equity part of its customer base is a temporary pause due to the fallout relating to the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March.  Endava trades for three times sales and 25 times earnings, both of which are near all-time lows. With strong results even in the face of some important customers' short-term challenges, the current valuation is compelling for this quickly growing business.";"0";"2023-05-30T12:29:38"
"Better Cathie Wood stock: Roku vs. Shopify";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1491lkj/better_cathie_wood_stock_roku_vs_shopify/";"   **Roku** and **Shopify** are two of Cathie Wood's favorite long-term holdings. The famed growth investor's flagship exchange-traded fund, the **Ark Innovation ETF**, holds Roku as its second-largest position (7.99% of its portfolio) and Shopify as its eighth-largest position (4.55%).  Both companies grew rapidly throughout the pandemic as consumers watched more streaming videos on Roku's devices and did more online shopping through Shopify-powered storefronts. But they both faced tough post-pandemic slowdowns as those tailwinds dissipated, and rising interest rates exacerbated that pressure by driving investors away from higher-growth stocks.   That's why in 2022, Roku's stock plunged 82%, Shopify's stock fell 75%, and the Ark Innovation ETF shed 67% of its value. But since the beginning of 2023, shares of Roku and Shopify have both soared more than 70% as the Ark Innovation ETF rallied 36%. Does that rebound indicate it's finally safe to buy either stock again?   #  Roku's post-pandemic slowdown isn't over yet  Roku's revenue rose 58% in 2020 and 55% in 2021, but grew just 13% to $3.1 billion in 2022 as its platform and device businesses faced near-term challenges. Its higher-margin platform business, which sells ads across its Roku OS and free Roku Channel, struggled as the macro headwinds forced companies to rein in their ad spending. Its lower-margin device business grappled with supply chain constraints, high component prices, and stiff competition from other streaming device makers.    Roku's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) turned negative with a loss of $84 million in 2022, compared to a profit of $465 million in 2021, as its platform gross margins shrank and its device gross margins remained negative throughout the entire year. That pressure on its device business will likely worsen because it's absorbing its higher supply chain costs instead of passing them onto its consumers. It also recently launched its own first-party Roku TVs, which it will likely need to sell at paper-thin margins or even losses to remain competitive.    On the bright side, Roku's audience continues to expand. It ended the first quarter of 2023 with 71.6 million active accounts, representing 17% growth from a year earlier, and its streaming hours continue to rise sequentially and year over year. Unfortunately, the softness of its advertising business is still making it hard to grow its average revenue per user (ARPU), which declined 5% year over year in the first quarter.  For 2023, analysts expect Roku's revenue to rise 5% to $3.3 billion, but they expect its adjusted EBITDA loss to widen to $269 million. But in 2024 they expect its revenue growth to accelerate again as its adjusted EBITDA turns positive.   #  Shopify's post-pandemic growth is stabilizing   Shopify's self-service e-commerce tools enable merchants to launch their own online storefronts, process payments fulfilll orders, and manage their own marketing campaigns. That flexibility makes it a popular choice for sellers who don't want to join a crowded third-party marketplace like **Amazon**. It also became an essential tool for both merchants and customers when brick-and-mortar stores closed down during the pandemic.    Shopify's revenue rose 86% in 2020 and another 57% in 2021. Its adjusted net income jumped 1,332% in 2020 and grew 66% in 2021. But in 2022, its revenue only grew 21% as its adjusted net income plunged 94%. Its top-line growth cooled off as the pandemic passed, but it continued to ramp up its spending to expand its lower-margin Shop Pay payments platform and logistics network. Its acquisitions of 6 River Systems and Deliver, which were both aimed at strengthening its logistics capabilities, exacerbated that pressure on its operating margins.    Shopify's slowing growth and plummeting profits rattled the bulls, but the company has recently made some drastic changes. During its first-quarter earnings report, management told investors that Shopify would sell its entire logistics division to Flexport for a 13% stake in the private company. It also said it would lay off about a fifth of its workforce to stabilize its profits.   As a result, analysts expect Shopify's revenue to rise 20% in 2023 as its adjusted EPS grows a whopping 700%.   #  The valuations and verdict  Roku trades at three times this year's sales, while Shopify trades at 13 times this year's sales. Roku is trading at a lower valuation because it hasn't convinced the market its business model is sustainable, but investors are still paying a premium for the long-term growth potential of Shopify's e-commerce services.  I wouldn't rush to buy either of these stocks right now. But if I had to choose one over the other, I'd stick with Shopify because it's growing faster, making bolder decisions, and its business model seems more disruptive.";"0";"2023-06-14T09:39:16"
"Don't miss out on the rebound: Grab these super stocks on the dip";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/13ojoib/dont_miss_out_on_the_rebound_grab_these_super/";"   ## 1. Confluent's largest customer cohort continues to outperform  Data streaming is a technology rapidly growing in importance for businesses because consumers are increasingly demanding more live experiences from their digital products and services. **Confluent** **(****CFLT****)** is a leader in the industry, and some of the largest companies in the world are flocking to its platform.  https://preview.redd.it/1d47wfra1c1b1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=18d11ba93beb4cb1dc036b0c617549b74d19a8d2     Cloud computing allows businesses to operate online, and every interaction within their digital ecosystem creates data. The ability to use that information instantly is a game changer for the customer experience: a retailer, for example, can manage inventory in real time so products never go out of stock. And an online sports betting platform can offer live markets during a game because data streaming allows them to calculate odds, feed them to the users, and accept bets -- all within seconds.  The technology has implications for almost every industry, and International Data Corp. predicts 90% of the world's 1,000 largest companies will be using it by 2025.   In the first quarter of 2023, Confluent generated $174.3 million in revenue, up 38% year over year and well above its $168 million forecast. But there was an even more impressive figure: The number of businesses spending $1 million or more on Confluent's platform surged 53% -- more than three times faster than the company's customer base grew overall.     ## 2. DigitalOcean continues to outgrow its trillion-dollar competitors  **DigitalOcean** **(****DOCN** **-2.30%)** is a provider of cloud computing services that allow its customers to store data, host websites, and even develop software. It has one significant point of difference from its major competitors like **Amazon** Web Services (AWS) and **Microsoft** Azure: DigitalOcean targets small to medium-sized businesses with under 500 employees.  https://preview.redd.it/j5ogu8pz1c1b1.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9d5ea9ad7f757754226d5a6593c27779b6bc798   It's a lucrative segment of the cloud market because DigitalOcean can develop a relationship with businesses in their start-up phase and then reap the financial rewards when they begin to scale up. The company offers personalized service, cheap pricing, and a simple cloud platform with one-click deployment tools designed to suit its target customers. Other cloud providers are more focused on large enterprise customers, so they don't typically offer a competing value proposition for small businesses.     As of Q1, DigitalOcean had 146,500 customers spending more than $50 per month. That includes 15,000 ""scalers,"" which are its top spenders, each contributing an average of $1,962 per month to DigitalOcean's revenue. Speaking of which, the company generated $165.1 million in revenue during the quarter, marking an increase of 30% year over year. That was a faster growth rate for the period than AWS (16%), Microsoft Azure (27%), and **Alphabet**'s Google Cloud (28%) delivered!  &#x200B:  ## 3. Redfin stock has soared 149% in 2023  **Redfin**'s **(****RDFN** **-4.18%)** got off to a strong start in 2023, with the stock price up 149% so far this year. But it's still down 88% from its all-time high. The real estate technology company struggled over the last 18 months because the U.S. Federal Reserve embarked on the most aggressive campaign to hike interest rates in its history to fight soaring inflation. That's directly impacting demand for housing because consumers can't afford to borrow as much money, leading to a slowdown in Redfin's business.  https://preview.redd.it/f9q0wwkd2c1b1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=09c39ca2be669cca3c9cb6df40d69816a7367bc1  Redfin employs 1,876 lead agents covering 98% of the U.S. housing market (geographically), allowing the company to operate at a level of scale that smaller independent realtors can't match. As a result, it charges listing fees as low as 1%, undercutting the more common rate of 2.5% and creating a win-win for Redfin and its sellers.  The company is so popular that it represented 0.78% of the nearly 2 million houses sold in America during the first quarter of 2023. That might not sound like a big number, but there are 3 million registered agents across the country, so Redfin is punching well above its weight.  Due to the absence of direct buying, Redfin's revenue crashed 45% in Q1 compared to the same quarter last year (as expected). But Redfin is now a much leaner, healthier business, and it expects to deliver positive non-GAAP earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) this year. That's primarily why investors have sent Redfin stock soaring in 2023, and it might just be getting warmed up.";"0";"2023-05-22T09:24:34"
"The Bad Economics Of The Audio Streaming Industry (Spotify Example)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/17m3215/the_bad_economics_of_the_audio_streaming_industry/";"Hey everyone, before I share with you my thoughts on Spotify, I thought it might be a good idea to share a famous quote from Warren Buffett, which I think applies to the audio streaming market: *'When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact'.*  This posts breaks down:  * Overview of Spotify * Economics of the Audio Streaming Business * Why I think its bad economics for investors  # Spotify Overview:   Spotify is one of the world’s most popular audio streaming subscription service giving access to over 100 million tracks and 5 million podcasts to millions of members. Spotify is the leader in the audio streaming market with a market share of 30.5% and Spotify has been growing their premium subscribers every year with no signs of slowing down.  *Premium Subscribers (In Millions)*  |**2015**|**2016**|**2017**|**2018**|**2019**|**2020**|**2021**|**2022**|**2023 (2Qs)**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |92|154|244|341|445|567|675|770|*430\**|  In 2022, the global audio streaming market was around $34 billion. The audio streaming market is expected to grow to over $100 billion by 2030 according to research and markets. Despite Spotify's growth and the growth of the industry at large, the economics of Spotify and other businesses in this market doesn't appear to be looking good at all and in my opinion I don't see signs of improvement. I will explain the economics of the industry a little below but I will first present revenue and profitability in years 2015 & 2022:  *Revenue (In Millions)*  |**2015**|**2022**| |:-|:-| |$1,940|$11,727|  *Profitability (In Millions)*  |**2015**|**2022**| |:-|:-| |($235)|($689)|  Although I only present these two years, operating losses for this company has been consistent in all years between this period. Someone has to cover the cost of the money losing operations of Spotify and it looks as if shareholders has been footing the bill. Shares outstanding has been increasing.  Shares outstanding:  |**2015**|**2022**| |:-|:-| |141,946,000|195,846,362|  I believe Spotify can continue to grow revenue but I think the path to profitability is no where near in sight. Looking more closely into the economics of the audio streaming business, it appears that Spotify **doesn't have a moat** and I don't think any competitor can gain an advantage in this industry.  # Economics of the Audio Streaming Business   There are certain rules in this industry that prevent any company from gaining any real advantage from another. The audio streaming business is subject to a ‘most favored nation clause’, which sounds complicated but it essentially means that audio streaming providers such as Spotify is in some ways restricted from negotiating exclusive deals with artists. Let’s say Spotify has agreed to a deal with a music publisher at $10,000, and this deal contains a most favoured nation clause, if another publisher comes in and agrees to a $15,000 deal with Spotify, then Spotify will have to pay the same amount to first publisher. For example, let’s say Spotify signed an agreement that gives it permission to stream **The Weeknd** ***(which is the most listened artist on Spotify)*** on its platform. And this agreement contains a MFN clause. The way this works is that Spotify will need to pay royalties to the Universal Music Group, which is the Weeknd’s publisher, every time a song is played on its platform. The Royalty rates are set by the Copyright Royalty Board which establishes the minimum rate a streaming service has to pay their artists. If Spotify signs a new agreement with **Rihanna,** and Spotify pays Rihanna's publisher (Sony/ATV) a higher amount to stream her songs on the platform, then Spotify will have to pay the difference to the Weekend Publisher because of the clause agreement. This applies to other audio streaming services such as Apple Music, Youtube Music, etc.  # Why this is bad economics for Spotify investors    **Reason 1:** Since it is in the best interests of music artists to go after those MFN agreements: this really prevents any audio streaming service from signing exclusive deals with music artists that prevent from being streamed on other platforms. It is also the goal of a music artist to promote their music as far and as wide as possible and be to paid the maximum amount, and to do that, any major artist, or any artist in general will also have similar agreements with other streaming platforms, giving none of these platforms any competitive advantage. ***This is very different from video streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, who has their own production studio and exclusive rights to TV shows and movies.***  **Reason 2:** As someone who likes listening to music, it really doesn’t bother me what platform I use, as long I can listen to the music I like. So I really struggle to find any competitive advantage Spotify has and because of that, I’m not really sure if Spotify can maintain its position in the market without spending an excessive amount. And from what we have already seen, Spotify is already struggling to keep its costs down so achieving a sustainable level of profits in the future is very hard to predict.  **Reason 3:** Competition. Since the audio streaming market is huge and is expected to grow, this will attract new competitors into the market. Without a competitive advantage (other than a well-known brand - not very durable) Spotify will likely need to increase their costs further in the future to maintain and protect its market share of 30.5%. If more competitors enter the market, then Spotify will need to increase marketing costs to attract new consumers, this expense may increase by a lot. Since Spotify is a technology company, research and development costs will need to continually increase, since old and new competitors will be investing to improve their audio streaming service so they take market share from Spotify. Another problem is pricing. Let’s imagine a new competitor enters the market and sells their streaming service at a lower price than Spotify. Spotify will then need to reduce its subscription costs to prevent their members from cancelling their membership and signing up with a competitor.  Those are my thoughts on Spotify and the economics of the audio streaming business. As a consumer and a lover of music, we gain the benefit of competition. However, I think the consumer benefit will continue to come at the expense of shareholders. Of course, I could be wrong. Please share your thoughts on Spotify and whether you agree or disagree with my review, I welcome any discussion :)  Hope everyone is enjoying their day.";"27";"2023-11-02T14:05:22"
"An Open Letter to the CEO and directors of Cloudflare";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/159c3ez/an_open_letter_to_the_ceo_and_directors_of/";"   To Mr. Matthew Prince, and Directors of Cloudflare,  My name is Ming Wong, and I am the CEO of Zetalon Ltd., a company that has been a committed investor and free user of Cloudflare's services. I am penning this open letter to express my concerns and provide suggestions that, I believe, could contribute to the financial performance and longevity of Cloudflare.  Despite the company's remarkable growth in customer base and service offerings since its initial public offering in 2019, the financial reports from 2019 to the present indicate a continuous operation at a loss, with a reported loss of $190.1M in 2022. This persistent inability to turn a profit raises serious concerns about the company's long-term sustainability and its value creation for shareholders.  I understand that Cloudflare's strategy has been to build customer loyalty and support small websites to grow into large, paid websites. This is a commendable approach, and it has indeed resulted in a significant increase in Cloudflare's customer base. However, it is also clear that this strategy has not been successful in turning the company's impressive growth into profitability.  Cloudflare's growth and market presence are indeed impressive. The company boasts over 4 million customers, including 17% of Fortune 500 companies. It generated $431.06 million in revenue in 2020, a 5.08x increase since 2016. There are 7.59 million active websites using Cloudflare, and the company has 119,206 paying customers. These paying customers produced 88.84% of the revenue, indicating a significant reliance on a relatively small portion of the user base.  Despite this impressive market share, Cloudflare has fewer high-traffic websites compared to competitors like Akamai, Amazon CloudFront, and Fastly. This is a clear indication that the company's current strategy is not fully capitalizing on its potential.  Importantly, Cloudflare provides its services at a more affordable rate than many of its competitors, including BelugaCDN, Amazon Web Services, Stack Path, Microsoft Azure, and Google. This competitive pricing gives Cloudflare an edge in attracting customers, particularly small and medium enterprises looking for cost-effective solutions. While this strategy contributes to Cloudflare's expansive customer base, it further underlines the necessity of increasing revenue streams beyond just customer subscriptions.  However, the current financial performance poses potential risks to the shareholders. Continuous operation at a loss can diminish shareholder value over time, which could eventually lead to shareholder dissatisfaction and the potential for capital flight. Shareholder value should not be an afterthought: rather, it is a primary goal that aligns with the company's growth and success.  To address this and enhance profitability, I propose a strategic shift in Cloudflare's approach to its free services. Here are the specific changes I propose:  Limit Free Plan Features: Disallow features like Async JavaScript Loading with Rocket Loader and Multi-User Administrative Access and Read-only User Access in the free plan. Also, limit the number of free custom hostnames from 100 to 50. These changes will encourage multi-employee companies to upgrade to a paid plan.  Introduce Ads on the ""Checking your browser before accessing"" Page: By forcing this page to be shown on all free websites, it can serve as an effective platform for displaying ads, providing an additional revenue stream. This change could also serve as a stepping stone for Cloudflare to develop its own ad network, further diversifying its revenue streams.  Introduce a $20 per Year Plan: Replace the current free plan with a $20 per year plan. This nominal fee is affordable for most users and can generate significant revenue given Cloudflare's large user base.  Although these changes may entail risks such as potential customer dissatisfaction and a possible initial decrease in the user base, it is important to emphasize the long-term benefits. Implementing these changes could not only result in increased revenue but also lead to a diversified business model less reliant on customer subscriptions alone. This diversification could reduce risk in the long term and lead to a more robust, resilient business. Moreover, the profitability from these strategic shifts could significantly increase shareholder value over time, securing the company's longevity and growth prospects.  Here are some rough estimates:  If 25% of the 7.48 million free websites move to the $20 per year plan, that's 1.87 million websites. At $20 per website per year, the potential revenue increase would be $37.4 million per year.  Assuming 25% of websites stop using Cloudflare, the remaining free plan users would be 3.24 million websites. Assuming the average daily traffic of the websites is 100, that's 324 million page views per day. Over a year, that's approximately 118.26 billion page views. With a $3 CPM, the average CPM of Google Display Network ads, the potential ad revenue would be approximately $354.780 million per year.  So, the total potential revenue increase from both the $20 per year plan and the ads would be approximately $392.18 million per year. This revenue increase not only covers the $193.4 million loss reported in 2022 but also potentially results in a significant profit.  I understand and appreciate the reasoning behind Cloudflare's commitment to a free service, and I am cognizant of the factors that make it such an invaluable asset. I'd like to address each of these points:  Data: Cloudflare's ability to gather a wide array of data from its free service users, thereby enhancing protection for paid users, is indeed commendable. My proposition for limiting features on the free plan and the introduction of a $20 per year plan should not compromise this ability. A lower-tiered paid plan may even encourage more users to sign up, potentially offering a larger data set.  Customer Referrals: I recognize that customer referrals, particularly from satisfied users of the free service, play a pivotal role in attracting larger customers. I believe that a $20 per year plan would continue to offer tremendous value, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction and continuing to drive referrals.  Employee Referrals: I acknowledge the importance of the free plan in attracting potential employees. I propose that, with careful communication and strategic rollout, the changes will be accepted and will continue to attract top talent to Cloudflare.  QA: Offering new features to free customers for testing is indeed a unique and valuable approach. The changes I propose should not interfere with this. On the contrary, a more diverse range of customers due to a $20 plan may provide even more varied feedback and testing.  Bandwidth Chicken & Egg: I understand the role of free customers in achieving the scale necessary for competitive pricing and regional peering. By introducing a reasonably priced $20 per year plan, I believe that we can maintain, if not increase, the diversity and scale of our customer base.  Looking ahead, I believe that Cloudflare holds substantial growth opportunities, which, if tapped into strategically, could enhance long-term benefits for both the company and its shareholders. Specifically, I would like to highlight three potential areas of expansion:  Ad Networks: By introducing ads on the ""Checking your browser before accessing"" page, Cloudflare could diversify its revenue streams and lay the foundation for establishing its own ad network. Ad networks have been profitable ventures for many tech companies, and with Cloudflare's broad user base, there is significant potential for high returns.  Web Hosting Services: Cloudflare's existing infrastructure and network capacity make it an ideal candidate to offer web hosting services. This could attract a new customer segment that's looking for a one-stop-shop for their website needs, generating additional revenue while enhancing the company's value proposition.  Virtual Private Servers (VPS): The growing trend towards remote work and online businesses increases the demand for reliable and affordable VPS. By offering VPS services, Cloudflare could capitalize on this trend and further strengthen its market position.  By expanding into these areas, Cloudflare would not only diversify its offerings but also create synergies with its existing services. For instance, customers using Cloudflare's web hosting or VPS services could be more likely to use other Cloudflare services, creating a more integrated and stickier customer base.  Moreover, these new revenue streams could greatly enhance the long-term financial performance of the company. While the initial investment might be substantial, the potential for increased and diversified revenue could outweigh the costs in the long term, driving profitability, and thereby enhancing shareholder value.  While I believe that the changes, I propose carry significant potential for profit and growth, I am aware that they also present certain risks. Therefore, I find it essential to acknowledge and consider these risks in your decision-making process.  Customer Backlash: Changes to the free plan could lead to a backlash from current free users. However, it's important to note that even with these changes, Cloudflare's services are still very competitively priced. Therefore, despite changes to the free plan, Cloudflare will continue to provide excellent value for its users. Nevertheless, careful communication about these changes and potentially introducing transitional measures could help manage this risk effectively.  Competitive Dynamics: A change in Cloudflare's pricing structure could potentially alter competitive dynamics in the market, possibly inciting competitive responses from other CDN and cloud service providers.  Ad Network Viability: While the potential revenue from ads is significant, building an ad network also involves challenges. Besides the technical challenges, it may also take time to attract advertisers and achieve profitable scale.  Diversification Risks: While diversifying into web hosting services and VPS may seem attractive, it's important to consider that Cloudflare would be competing in a new market with its own competitive dynamics and established players. Moreover, the investment required to establish a presence in these markets could be substantial.  As with any strategic decisions, it's crucial to balance the potential rewards with the inherent risks. While the strategies I propose carry risks, I believe that with careful planning and execution, these risks can be effectively managed. Moreover, the potential long-term benefits in terms of revenue growth, profitability, and shareholder value are significant.  I am confident in Cloudflare's potential for growth and profitability. However, it is crucial that the management team takes decisive action to address the current profitability issues. The proposed strategies are not just about improving the financial performance of the company, but also about fulfilling the company's responsibilities to its shareholders.  Thank you for taking the time to consider my concerns and proposals. I firmly believe that these strategic shifts would significantly enhance Cloudflare's profitability and shareholder value. I urge the board to conduct a thorough review of the proposed strategies and consider implementing them for the long-term success of the company.  I look forward to your response and to seeing Cloudflare seize these growth opportunities, ensuring a prosperous future for all stakeholders.  Best regards,  Ming Wong  CEO, Zetalon Ltd.

Today, it stands as a global leader in e-commerce, cloud computing, digital media, and other technological innovations. The company’s foundation lies in addressing customer needs and fostering an ecosystem where all participants create and share value. Known for its massive online marketplaces, Alibaba has expanded its reach into various sectors, positioning itself as a key player in the digital economy.  ### Alibaba’s Strategic Shift: Embracing AI and Global Commerce  Alibaba Group, under the leadership of CEO Yongming ‘Eddie’ Wu, is at a pivotal juncture, redefining its strategic direction to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving digital landscape. The company’s recent earnings call highlighted significant shifts in its operational and strategic focus, emphasizing the importance of AI-driven technology and a global commerce network as its primary growth drivers for the next decade.  The company is undergoing a transformation, focusing on establishing a nimble and fast decision-making governance structure. This shift is crucial as Alibaba contends with rapidly developing technologies and changing market expectations. The corporate governance reforms initiated this year aim to enhance the company’s entrepreneurial mindset and improve its decision-making systems.  Alibaba is also conducting a strategic review of its existing businesses, distinguishing between core and non-core segments. After 24 years, Alibaba is evolving from a single company into a new governance model of “1+6+N” in which major business groups and various companies have independent operations.  “1” represents Alibaba Group’s holding company, “6” refers to six major business groups – Cloud Intelligence Group, Taobao and Tmall Group, Local Services Group, Alibaba International Digital Commerce (AIDC) Group, Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited, and Digital Media and Entertainment Group, and “N” refers to various businesses such as Alibaba Health, Sun Art Retail, and Freshippo.  The company is intensively investing in its core businesses, pursuing R&D, and enhancing user experiences to ensure long-term vitality and competitiveness. This approach is expected to maximize synergy across business groups, striking a balance between independence and cooperation.  In terms of financial performance, Alibaba remains committed to delivering shareholder value. During fiscal year 2023, the company repurchased approximately US$10.9 billion of its shares, representing a significant portion of its free cash flow. This move underscores Alibaba’s confidence in its financial health and long-term prospects.  Moreover, Alibaba’s cloud computing platform, the third largest globally, is set to play a pivotal role in the company’s future. The convergence of AI and cloud computing is identified as a key impetus for future development, signaling Alibaba’s commitment to technological innovation and transformation.  In summary, Alibaba Group is strategically positioning itself to navigate the challenges and opportunities of the new digital era. By focusing on AI-driven technologies, global commerce, and a reinvigorated corporate structure, the company is poised to unlock new growth avenues and reinforce its market leadership.  ### Recent Financials:  Alibaba’s diverse business model, spanning from China commerce to international commerce and digital media, has enabled it to maintain financial stability. Despite global economic fluctuations, Alibaba generated substantial free cash flow, evidencing its robust financial health. The company’s strategic investments in new technologies and talent, coupled with a significant share repurchase program, reflect its commitment to long-term value creation and shareholder returns.  Alibaba’s financial performance over the past few years has been noteworthy. The company has experienced a 5-year CAGR free cash flow growth of 12% and a FCF margin of 22%. Additionally, its 5-year CAGR revenue growth over the same period was about 28%. Despite the market’s negative sentiment, Alibaba’s net debt stands at an impressive -$51.48 billion, with a market capitalization of $183 billion. The fiscal year 2023 has shown improvement across all business segments, with notable growth in international commerce and steady performance in local services, digital media, and cloud services. Alibaba’s ability to maintain profitability and generate substantial cash flow, despite challenging market conditions, and political concerns speaks to its financial resilience and operational efficiency.  ### Financial Bullet Points:  * Revenue: RMB 224.79 billion (2023-09-30), **up** 8.5% YoY. * Gross Profit: RMB 85.13 billion (2023-09-30), 12.06% **increase** YoY. * Net Income: RMB 27.85 billion (2023-09-30), **significantly up** from a previous year’s loss. * Gross Margin: 37.87% (2023-09-30), an **increase** from 36.67% the previous year. * FCF Margin: 21.90% (2023-09-30), an **increase** from 16.89% the previous year.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/hhoymiovja6c1.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=0528b5afd12d68f769ef77bbe4758222378b7456  ### Business Model & Competitors Analysis:  Alibaba’s business model is diverse, spanning e-commerce, cloud computing, digital media, and entertainment. Its major e-commerce platforms, Taobao and Tmall, are the cornerstone of its success, offering a wide range of products and services. Alibaba Cloud, the digital backbone of the company, provides cloud services and solutions, supporting businesses globally.  In terms of competition, Alibaba faces challenges from domestic players like Tencent and JD.com, as well as international giants like Amazon and Google, especially in cloud computing and digital services.  ### SWOT Analysis:  * **Strengths**: Strong market presence, diverse business portfolio, robust cloud computing services. * **Weaknesses**: Regulatory and political challenges, dependence on the Chinese market. * **Opportunities**: Expansion in international markets, advancements in AI and technology. * **Threats**: Intense competition, geopolitical tensions, and changing market dynamics.  ### Investment Outlook:  Alibaba’s current market valuation appears significantly undervalued, especially when considering its robust financials and market position. Analysis using discounted cash flow models suggests even with very low assumptions, that Alibaba’s fair value is more than double its current stock price. This undervaluation presents a substantial opportunity for investors. The company’s financial health, combined with its potential for growth and recovery, makes it a compelling choice for those looking to invest in a company with a strong foundation and promising future prospects. Despite the recent political challenges and market volatility, Alibaba’s fundamentals and strategic positioning hint at a significant upside potential in the coming years.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/rmo8zycuja6c1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f9b835225efb9ff88b56622b163b5f8aca439b6  Loop Capital holds a perspective that Alibaba’s valuation does not factor in its international commerce, local services, logistics, digital media, and Ant Group segments. Despite this, they have set a price target of $115 for Alibaba, indicating a potential 65% upside. They also observe that the core e-commerce business of Alibaba is currently valued at 7 times earnings, which they consider to be a subdued valuation. Under more typical market conditions, Loop Capital suggests that a more appropriate multiple for this segment would be around 15 times earnings.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/00itg8asja6c1.jpg?width=692&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4b8aa0cace10e185be1d460452f8a071d6ed1ea  ### Concluding Remarks:  Alibaba Group is at a transformative phase, strategically positioning itself for the future. With a strong financial foundation, a focus on AI and technology, and a commitment to core business segments, Alibaba is well-equipped to navigate the challenges and seize the opportunities of the digital era.
