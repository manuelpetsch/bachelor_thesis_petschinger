"Nvidia is worth more than Amazon and Google. Hunting down Apple next ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b3yy0q/nvidia_is_worth_more_than_amazon_and_google/";"Make it make sense people.   It blows my mind. Amazon and Google are power houses with some of the greatest company “moats” I’ve ever seen. Nvidia is definitely dominating their market but it sure doesn’t seem they have nearly the diversified portfolio these other heavy weights do. Or the protection from another company catching up.   Google (search, cloud, mobile, YouTube, software, AI, advertising, consumer electronics, etc.) and Amazon (e-commerce, cloud, Prime, advertising, subscriptions, grocery, consumer electronics, etc)  It’s just crazy to me. Happy Friday folks. ";"2420";"2024-03-01T17:46:56"
"FTC readies lawsuit that could break up Amazon";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/159o8pp/ftc_readies_lawsuit_that_could_break_up_amazon/";"The Federal Trade Commission is finalizing its long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, four people with knowledge of the matter told POLITICO, a move that could ultimately break up parts of the company.  The FTC has been investigating the company on a number of fronts, and the coming case would be one of the most aggressive and high-profile moves in the Biden administration’s rocky effort to tame the power of tech giants. The wide-ranging lawsuit is expected as soon as August, and will likely challenge a host of Amazon’s business practices, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss a confidential matter. If successful, it could lead to a court-ordered restructuring of the $1.3 trillion empire and define the legacy of FTC Chair Lina Khan.  Khan rose to prominence as a Big Tech skeptic with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in. Because any case will likely take years to wind through the courts, the final result will rest with her successors. The exact details of the final lawsuit are not known, and changes to the final complaint are expected until the eleventh hour. But personnel throughout the agency, including Khan herself, have homed in on several of Amazon’s business practices, said some of the people.  The complaint is likely to focus on challenges to Amazon Prime, Amazon rules that the FTC says block lower prices on competing websites, and policies the FTC believes force merchants to use Amazon’s logistics and advertising services, according to some of the people.  The agency has been drafting a complaint since at least the end of last year, some of the people said, and is likely to file its case in federal court rather than its in-house tribunal.  In its probe, the FTC has interviewed dozens of witnesses both inside and outside Amazon, including CEO Andy Jassy and former CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, some of the people said. The FTC has collected millions of documents from Amazon and third parties over the last three years to build its case.

"Amazon's $150 Billion Data Center Bet: Preparing for AI Boom and Market Domination";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1brp6gc/amazons_150_billion_data_center_bet_preparing_for/";"ARTICLE TLDR: Amazon is investing a whopping $150 billion over 15 years to build data centers, anticipating a surge in demand for AI and digital services. This move aims to cement Amazon's lead in cloud services and enhance customer satisfaction. Additionally, Amazon is allocating over $1 billion this year to Nvidia's new Blackwell AI data center, further underlining its commitment to staying ahead in the tech race. With previous significant expenditures and strategic acquisitions, Amazon signals a bullish stance on profitability and market dominance.

"Amazon cuts hundreds of jobs in cloud computing unit";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1buvr9l/amazon_cuts_hundreds_of_jobs_in_cloud_computing/";"Amazon’s cloud computing division is laying off hundreds of employees in its physical stores technology and sales and marketing units, the company confirmed on Wednesday.  “We’ve identified a few targeted areas of the organization we need to streamline in order to continue focusing our efforts on the key strategic areas that we believe will deliver maximum impact,” an AWS spokesperson said in a statement. “We didn’t make these decisions lightly, and we’re committed to supporting the employees throughout their transition to new roles in and outside of Amazon.”  The cuts were first reported by GeekWire.  Amazon’s lucrative AWS unit has seen its sales growth decelerate in recent quarters as companies trimmed their cloud spend amid rising interest rates. Amazon executives expressed some optimism in February when they said the market is starting to show signs of a reacceleration.  The cuts to AWS’ store technology team come after Amazon said it would remove cashierless checkout systems in its U.S. Fresh stores. The AWS unit includes teams overseeing the cashierless tech, called Just Walk Out, as well as its Dash smart carts and Amazon One palm-based payment technology. The store technology team was moved out of Amazon’s retail group and folded into its cloud computing division in 2022.  The AWS spokesperson said the company decided to make cuts to the store technology division “as a result of a broader strategic shift in the use of some applications in Amazon’s owned as well as in third-party stores.”  Amazon continues to trim its headcount after more than a year of mass layoffs. Beginning at the end of 2022 and continuing through 2023, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs across almost every area of the company. So far this year, Amazon has laid off employees in its Twitch, Audible, Buy with Prime, and Prime Video and MGM Studios units.  Employees in the U.S. will continue to receive their pay and benefits for at least 60 days, and they will be eligible for a severance package.

"Amazon Is in Talks to Offer Free Mobile Service to US Prime Members";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13yfjve/amazon_is_in_talks_to_offer_free_mobile_service/";"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-talks-offer-free-mobile-123703089.html  Amazon.com Inc. has been talking with wireless carriers about offering low-cost or possibly free nationwide mobile phone service to Prime subscribers, according to people familiar with the situation. The company is negotiating with Verizon Communications Inc., T-Mobile US Inc. and Dish Network Corp. to get the lowest possible wholesale prices. That would let it offer Prime members wireless plans for $10 a month or possibly for free and bolster loyalty among its biggest spending customers, the people said, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter.  The talks have been going on for six to eight weeks and have also included AT&T Inc. at times, but the plan may take several more months to launch and could be scrapped, one person said. Dish shares jumped 14% Friday in New York since a deal with the retail giant could help the struggling satellite-TV company as it transitions to become a national wireless carrier. Meanwhile, T-Mobile fell 8.4%, AT&T dropped 5% and Verizon slid 3.5.%. The big three national carriers could see their own subscribers flee to a cheaper option at Amazon. Deutsche Telekom AG, which holds a majority stake in T-Mobile, fell 5.7% in Germany. “We are always exploring adding even more benefits for Prime members, but don’t have plans to add wireless at this time,” Amazon spokesperson Maggie Sivon said in a statement. Verizon and Dish declined to comment.  Amazon’s US Prime subscribers pay $139 a year for privileges like speedy free delivery, video streaming and access to 100 million songs. Analysts say Prime membership has stagnated in the country since Amazon boosted the annual price from $119, a sign that a subscription is less attractive to consumers struggling with a stubbornly high inflation rate. About 167 million Amazon shoppers had Prime memberships as of March, unchanged from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Amazon is competing with Walmart Inc., whose $98-a-year Walmart+ membership is emerging as a lower-cost alternative offering many of the same perks as Prime and free grocery delivery on orders of at least $35. Amazon in February increased its free grocery delivery threshold to $150 from $35. For the wireless industry, an Amazon deal could be seen as a welcome boost to wholesale revenue and a way to attract more traffic to newly expanded 5G networks. But Amazon’s entry could be detrimental if Prime wireless becomes popular and starts to chip away at the big carriers’ customer base.  A deeply below-market price from one of the world’s largest retailers could easily undercut the pricing power of the big three national carriers, making it tempting for subscribers to go to Amazon. Unlimited plans start at $60 a month at Verizon and T-Mobile, with AT&T starting at $65. Anytime Amazon enters a new market, it sends shivers through the industry because the Seattle-based retail giant has shown it’s willing to absorb billions of dollars in shipping and movie production costs to fuel Prime membership growth. Wireless service could be just one more item that Amazon’s willing to take a hit on if it gives the company a leg up versus Walmart.";"1368";"2023-06-02T17:17:52"
"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says he's committed to cost cutting while investing in AI in shareholder letter";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1c1ckwh/amazon_ceo_andy_jassy_says_hes_committed_to_cost/";"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on Thursday published his annual shareholder letter, where he pledged to keep looking for ways to keep costs in check even as the company doubles down on investing in new growth areas like artificial intelligence.  “I think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one of our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers’ lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we’re investing,” Jassy wrote in his third shareholder letter since taking the helm at Amazon from former CEO Jeff Bezos, who stepped down in 2021.  Under Jassy, Amazon has morphed into a leaner version of itself, as slowing sales and a challenging economy pushed the company to eschew the relentless growth of the Bezos years. Beginning at the end of 2022 and continuing through 2023, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs. Those cuts have continued this year, with Amazon announcing layoffs in its cloud computing, Prime Video and Twitch livestreaming units, among others.  Even amid a period of retrenchment in some areas, Jassy said he’s focused on finding new areas of growth within the company so that Amazon remains “resilient.” He stressed the importance of building “primitive services,” which he described as “discrete, foundational building blocks” that can spur new projects and businesses.  Jassy used Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing division, as an example. Before he became Amazon’s CEO, Jassy oversaw the creation of AWS, which grew from an internal tool to become the dominant cloud service and one of Amazon’s most profitable businesses.  He said he believes generative artificial intelligence stands to be Amazon’s next “primitive service” that could transform the company. “We’re optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS,” Jassy wrote.  Amazon on Thursday added Andrew Ng, a renowned AI pioneer who previously led Google Brain and was a scientist at Baidu, to its board. Ng will replace Judy McGrath, who has sat on the board since 2014.  In the past year, Amazon has made a flurry of AI announcements as the field exploded, causing tech companies to pour money into the space. Last month, Amazon added $2.75 billion to its stake in AI startup Anthropic in its largest venture investment yet. Jassy has also pledged to infuse AI into every one of Amazon’s businesses.

"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy broke federal labor law with anti-union remarks";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ci40bs/amazon_ceo_andy_jassy_broke_federal_labor_law/";"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy violated federal labor law in comments he made to media outlets about unionization efforts at the company, a National Labor Relations Board judge ruled Wednesday.  NLRB Administrative Law Judge Brian Gee cited interviews Jassy gave in 2022 to CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Bloomberg Television and at The New York Times’ DealBook conference. The interviews coincided with an upswing in union campaigns in Amazon’s warehouse and delivery operations.  Jassy told CNBC in April 2022 that if employees were to vote in a union, they may be less empowered in the workplace and things would become “much slower” and “more bureaucratic.” Similarly, in the Bloomberg interview, Jassy remarked, “if you see something on the line that you think could be better for your team or you or your customers, you can’t just go to your manager and say, ‘Let’s change it.’”  At the DealBook conference, Jassy said that without a union the workplace isn’t “bureaucratic, it’s not slow.”  Gee said the comments “threatened employees that, if they selected a union, they would become less empowered and would find it harder to get things done quickly.”  The NLRB filed the complaint against Amazon and Jassy in October 2022. In his ruling Wednesday, Gee said Jassy’s other comments that unionization would change workers’ relationship with their employer were lawful. But the Amazon chief’s other remarks that employees would be less empowered and “better off” without a union violated labor law, “because they went beyond merely commenting on the employee-employer relationship.”  Amazon spokesperson Mary Kate Paradis said in a statement that the company disagrees with the NLRB’s ruling and that it intends to appeal.  “The decision reflects poorly on the state of free speech rights today, and we remain optimistic that we will be able to continue to engage in a reasonable discussion on these issues where all perspectives have an opportunity to be heard,” Paradis said.  The judge recommends Amazon be ordered to “cease and desist” from making such comments in the future, and that the company be required to post and distribute a notice about the order to employees nationwide.

"Amazon stock analysis: Why it's my only holding in my portfolio";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ah1ift/amazon_stock_analysis_why_its_my_only_holding_in/";"I'm more bullish on Amazon today than I was two days ago. Even though their stock price has increased by 6% in after markets. I think Amazon is valued less today than before their earnings. Their earnings were that good. I'll share with you my thoughts on Amazon and why my investing portfolio will change form 80% Amazon and 20% Google to 100% Amazon the second the market opens.  Let's have a look at all their revenue streams very briefly.  AWS. Cloud computing. In the words of Andy Jassy: a technology that will change businesses around the world with the same amount of impact the invention of electricity had on businesses. Businesses are only just now starting to adopt. We are still early in the early phases of cloud computing. AWS hit 90 billion in sales this year. And their last two quarters AWS had an operating income of 30%. AWS is getting more reasons to adopt and more reasons to increase spending by their customers due to the many AI solutions it offers to companies. It's safe to say AWS will hit 100 billion in revenue next year and that this will bring in around 30 billion in operating income. Many people are scared that AWS will have their customers stolen by Azure. Firstly, 90% of the cloud engineers I talk to, prefer AWS. Secondly, it costs a ton of money to set up cloud infrastructure for businesses. Why would they throw all their money away and spend this once again to make a switch to a different cloud provider. The majority of the current customers Amazon has aren't going anywhere. You can basically look at it as a subscription. Lastly on AWS, AWS has 6 times more server capacity than the next 12 competitors combined.  Advertising. Many people tend to forget how big Amazon advertising is. It generated $47 billion in the last twelve months and it's growing at 27% year on year. That means if there are 3 more years of 25% growth we are nearing an other nearly 100 billion revenue stream. And although we don't know their margins on advertising we know nearly certainly that it's generating higher profit margins than Meta or Google due to the fact that Amazon advertising is way more targeted. Oh you're looking at Amazon.com to buy a BBQ? Here's and advertisement of a BBQ. The cost per click on those type of ads will be very high.  Warehouse and logistics. This is the least sexy side of the business, but because of the amount of revenue it's still up there potential wise. Amazon online stores and third party sellers generated $410 billion in revenue in 2023. Amazon is the leader in logistics robotics. This has not only been told by Amazon, but this was dropped in the FedEx earnings call a few quarters back. Amazon is the company that will offer the best solutions as of now. They will most likely first fulfill their own needs and afterwards export their robotics to other parties for profit although now we are getting way ahead of ourselves as Amazon still hasn't impacted their own margins. Fulfillment cost used to hover around 27% of the product sales in 2020. After Covid, Amazon invested heavily in infrastructure for logistics. This increases maintenance and the need of personnel. Also they grew too much and too fast decreasing their margins. Their fulfillment cost was 31% of product sales in 2021, 35% in 2022 peaking at 37% in Q1 2023 and now ending Q4 2023 at 34% averaging once again 35% of the net product sales being the cost of fulfillment for the full year of 2023. But we see a decrease. Amazon went from 37% in Q1 2023 to now 34% in Q4 2023. This may not seem like a lot but when we are talking about such big numbers that this has significant impact. If Amazon would get their total fulfillment cost percentage compared to net product sales down to 33% for a full year this would leave Amazon with an extra 6 billion operating income. If Amazon would get the percentage down to 30% this would mean $13.5 billion more operating income than FY2023. If Amazon would get back to their previous 27%. This would mean a total of $21 billion more operating income. And keeping their current price to operating cash flow of 20 in mind (which is low compared to the historic mean of 27) an increase of $21 billion in a year means an increase of $420 billion in market cap. Keeping automation in mind I think they should have little trouble getting back to their old percentage of 27% in the next three to five years.  Amazon Prime, now the majority of prime members are coming from the US, Europe is only just now receiving prime content from their own country and advertisements to subscribe to prime. I'm located in the Netherlands we had a company that is comparable to Amazon for online products for here and Belgium way before Amazon arrived here. Amazon has been in the Netherlands since 2014 but they are just now completely blowing the competitor out of the water. Since one year me and many others are only using Amazon and now we are seeing ads to subscribe to prime. Subscribing to prime is only valuable if you actually make use of the logistics side of things. But it helps if prime has other things to offer as well. That's where we get to my next point. Prime video is partnering up with lots of famous people here to make Prime content. And the content isn't bad at all. That prime content hasn't even been rolling out for 6 months. Prime is just in its infancy for many countries it has recently moved into. Like I said Amazon is here since 2014 but only now I'm seeing Dutch shows on Amazon prime and having lots of people ask me to share my prime account with them. I'm sure the Netherlands wont be alone in this, it will be all the other countries as well. And guess what Amazon prime just received an additional big revenue stream, advertising. All users will receive advertisements unless they pay a few dollars a month to not see ads. Netflix earns more per subscriber that's on the cheaper subscription with ads than it does on the more expensive subscription without ads.  Additionally Amazon International gets even less love. Understandable though it's less revenue and barley sees a positive quarter. But what people forget is that it took Amazon US 10 years to turn profitable. So why do we think that International will be any faster, especially considering there is less infrastructure in countries outside of the US. I'd say we might need to wait 15 years for those countries to start making a profit. So which countries have been operational for longer than 15 years? The United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, China and Canada. Which countries have been operational for less than 15 years? Italy, Spain, Brazil, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore, Australia, Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Poland, Egypt and Belgium. We don't only need time for Amazon to build out the infrastructure. The middleclass in many of these countries is still growing which will increase activity in buying. And lastly, we need to give Amazon time to make Amazon prime subscription a valuable subscription in these countries by adding local content to Prime Video.  Amazon infrastructure, like I previously mentioned AWS has 6 times the server capacity compared to the next 12 competitors. Amazon is spending by far the most on renewable energy sources. They spent $2.5 billion on renewable energy, all to power their delivery vans and their servers. Although it may not seem huge but generating their in house electricity is bound to save them billions in the long run. Also Amazon is making their own chips for their AWS servers, they don't depend on a different party to be able to deliver. This in turn also increases their margins.  Lastly, Amazon is not sitting still. They have Amazon Gaming, Project Kuiper which has 3.000 satellites in orbit, they are making a plan to revolutionize the healthcare system and make it more cost and time efficient. They say in their call that they are still investing money to look for the next big pillar of Amazon, something that will be as big as AWS, advertising or Prime. They're not sitting still.  Okay story wise, I might have convinced you by now. But you could say, this is all a bunch of promising words. What about their valuation? Due to the fact Amazon invests a lot of their cash flow Amazon has usually been valued based on their price to operating cash flow. If we take the current after market price of Amazon of $169. Their current price to operating cash flow is at 20.6. This is 15% lower than what it was 2 days ago and this is 35% lower compared to their historical median price to operating cash flow of 27. Now this doesn't per se have to mean they will ever get back to that median price to operating cash flow so lets look at some different valuation methods. Remember Paypal was attractive to many people because it was ""only at a PE of 30"" instead of the usual 60. So lets keep on looking.  In Q4 of 2023 alone Amazon produced $30 billion free cash flow. Now Q4 is always a record quarter so we can't multiply this by 4. Q3 of 2023 Amazon had a free cash flow of $10 billion. This was still a quarter where many of their cost saving initiatives hadn't yet fully come to fruition, so although it was a much better quarter than Q2 which generated 6 billion in free cash flow. I'm very certain that Q3 free cash flow will be more in line with upcoming quarter. If we multiply 10 billion by 3 and 30 billion once. That's a free cash flow of 60 billion. This would be their free cash flow in 2024 if they don't grow, don't further increase margins and don't continue to lessen their investing of cash flow. If we take a quite reasonable (in my opinion) price to free cash flow of 30 times we see that Amazon stock should be valued at 1800 billion market cap. That's pretty much where the marketcap is at right now. Although I'm a firm believer that Amazon will grow in 2024. Let's not forget they are giving all their prime members ads from now on, or the ability to pay more for no ads. This alone will generate around 2 billion free cash flow in my estimation. Other than that I'm expecting Amazon to grow it's already existing revenue streams further, increase its margin further and decrease CAPEX. Which should result in record free cash flow in 2024. I'm estimating 12 billion in Q1, 13 billion in Q2, 15 billion in Q3 and 38 billion in Q4. Now I would love to tell you that these estimations are highly calculated by me and a pack of mathematicians. But I'll have to disappoint you and say that it's not. I've been doing estimates on Amazon every quarter based on the trends I see in the numbers and the story I pair with it. I have been quite spot on with the numbers so far. If my estimation would be reasonably close it would mean a market cap of 2.340 trillion, an increase of 34% at a price to free cash flow of 30 or an increase to a market cap of 2.730, an increase of 57% at a price to free cash flow of 35. Do note Microsoft is valued at 40 times price to free cash flow. And although I think Amazon and Microsoft should be valued similarly I find it hard to justify a price to free cash flow of 40 or more if you're not growing cash flow above 20% YoY.  We could also disassemble the components of Amazon and value these components with the price to sales of a company that offers similar services. To some people this might be a bit more hocus-pocus but I like doing this to see where Amazon stands in the market compared to other stocks. I'm using price to sales in this example because sadly we do not know the operating income on Amazon advertising and on Amazon Prime.  AWS had a total sales in FY 2023 of $90 billion. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Microsoft of 13 times. Resulting in AWS having a marketcap of $1,170 billion.  Amazon advertising has a total sales in FY 2023 of $47 billion. Lets get the average price to sales of two companies for this one. Google of 6 times price to sales and Meta of 8 times. Thus we multiply by 7. Resulting in Amazon advertising having a marketcap of $329 billion. Even though Amazon advertising has higher margins and is growing faster than Google and Meta.  Next up Amazon Prime had a total sales of $40 billion in FY 2023. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Netflix of 7.5. Resulting in Amazon Prime having a marketcap of $300 billion.  Lastly Amazon online stores, physical stores and logistics services offered to third party sellers generated a total revenue of 392$ billion in FY 2023. Lets take a price to sales of 0.70 based on the price to sales of Walmart at 0.71 and the price to sales of FedEx at 0.69. Resulting in a market cap of $274 billion dollars.  If we calculate all the components together we have a total market cap from Amazon of 2.073 trillion. An increase of 18.5% form the current prices. And this is based on historic number, not forward looking. Similarly when using the price to operating cash flow Amazon had two days ago of 23 we see that Amazon's stock is valued at a 15% cheaper price now than just two days ago. Supporting the argument that Amazon is more less 15% undervalued based on current prices, not forward looking expectations. This is why I moved my Google position into Amazon. As Google is looking undervalued by 15% on forward looking prices, but Amazon is looking undervalued by the same amount based on historic prices. Meaning if we expect Amazon to do slightly better in the future Amazon is a better buy than Google.  TLDR: I think Amazon is undervalued by 15% based on historic numbers.

"Meta, Microsoft and Amazon team up on maps project to crack Apple-Google duopoly";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15abmox/meta_microsoft_and_amazon_team_up_on_maps_project/";"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/meta-microsoft-amazon-join-overture-maps-to-vie-with-apple-google.html  Google and Apple dominate the market for online maps, charging mobile app developers for access to their mapping services. The other mega-cap tech companies are joining together to help create another option. A group formed by Meta, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, along with TomTom, is releasing data that could enable companies to build their own maps, without having to rely on Google or Apple. The Overture Maps Foundation, which was established late last year, captured 59 million “points of interest,” such as restaurants, landmarks, streets and regional borders. The data has been cleaned and formatted so it can be used for free as the base layer for a new map application.  Meta and Microsoft collected and donated the data to Overture, according to Marc Prioleau, executive director of the OMF. Data on places is often difficult to collect and license, and building map data requires lots of time and staff to gather and clean it, he told CNBC in an interview. “We have some companies that, if they wanted to invest to build the map data, they could,” Prioleau said. Rather than spending that kind of money, he said, companies were asking, “Can we just get collaboration around the open base map?” Overture is aiming to establish a baseline for maps data so that companies can use it to build and operate their own maps.  For many companies, Google’s and Apple’s maps aren’t ideal, because they don’t provide access to the underlying data. Instead, those companies allow app makers to use their maps as a service and, in many cases, charge each time the underlying map is accessed. For example, app makers pay per thousand Google Maps lookups through an application programming interface (API). Apple allows access to Apple Maps for free for native app developers, but web app developers need to pay. “That works for a lot of people, but not for others,” Prioleau said. Overture is only offering the underlying map data, leaving it up to companies to build their own software on top of it.";"795";"2023-07-26T19:13:04"

The Federal Trade Commission has filed its long-anticipated antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.  In a sweeping complaint unveiled Tuesday, the FTC and attorneys general from 17 states accused Amazon of wielding its “monopoly power” to inflate prices, degrade quality for shoppers and unlawfully exclude rivals, thereby undermining competition.  The agency laid out a two-pronged strategy by which Amazon “unlawfully maintains” its monopoly power. It pointed to so-called anti-discounting measures the company uses to punish sellers and deter other online retailers from offering lower, more competitive prices than Amazon, which translates to keeping prices higher for products across the internet, the FTC said.  Amazon also “effectively requires” that sellers use its “costly” fulfillment services in order to obtain the vaunted Prime badge for their products, the FTC said, which in turn makes it more expensive to do business on the platform.  These tactics have degraded the shopping experience on Amazon, the FTC added, and forced sellers to pay expensive fees to market their goods on the site, while facing no other choice “but to rely on Amazon to stay in business.”  The lawsuit is a major milestone for FTC Chair Lina Khan, who rose to prominence for her 2017 Yale Law Journal note, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” Khan argued in the article that the prominent antitrust framework at the time failed to capture the true extent of Amazon’s dominance and potential harm to competition. Through her work at the FTC, Khan has sought to reset that framework and push the boundaries of antitrust law through risky legal battles.  Amazon sought Khan’s recusal from antitrust investigations into its business, arguing that her past writing and critiques showed she had prejudged the outcome of such probes.  The charges are the culmination of several years of pressure on federal enforcers to deal with what some competitors, sellers and lawmakers saw as anticompetitive practices. Amazon was one of four Big Tech companies investigated by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, which found it held monopoly power over most of its third-party sellers and many suppliers. The majority Democratic staff at the time alleged that Amazon shored up “competitive moats” by acquiring rival sites like Diapers.com and Zappos.  At the time, an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement that “large companies are not dominant by definition, and the presumption that success can only be the result of anti-competitive behavior is simply wrong.”  Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, Amazon has transformed from an online bookseller into a retail, advertising and cloud computing giant with a staggering market valuation of roughly $1.4 trillion. The company has sought to expand its dominance by entering verticals like health care, streaming, and grocery, acquiring primary care provider One Medical, legendary film and television studio MGM, and upscale supermarket chain Whole Foods.  Those moves have attracted intense regulatory scrutiny. The House subcommittee report also accused Amazon of abusing its position in online retail to harm third-party merchants who rely on the platform to sell goods, and alleged it uses “strong-arm tactics” to bully retail partners. The FTC is also reviewing Amazon’s planned $1.7 billion acquisition of Roomba maker iRobot  on antitrust grounds. Amazon recently paid roughly $30 million to settle two privacy lawsuits brought by the FTC concerning its Ring doorbell and Alexa units. The agency followed up in June with a lawsuit accusing Amazon of tricking users into signing up for Prime,  while making it too difficult for them to cancel.  Amazon’s marketplace has transformed into a linchpin of its e-commerce business since its launch in 2000. The company had already expanded beyond its origins as a bookseller to offering things like CDs and videos. But once it opened its doors to third-party sellers, it supercharged the number and variety of products for sale on its website, earning it the moniker “the everything store.”  The third-party marketplace has given Amazon access to a higher-margin business than just selling books. It has also increased the fees it charges sellers to do business on its site, run advertisements, and tap into its fulfillment and delivery services. In the first half of 2023, the company collected a 45% cut of every sale made by sellers in the U.S., up from 19% in 2014, according to the nonprofit Institute for Local Self Reliance. Sales from third-party sellers now comprise 60% of total units sold, the company recently disclosed.";"282";"2023-09-26T18:15:51"
"Amazon spends $2.75B on AI startup Anthropic, its largest venture investment";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bp6rv9/amazon_spends_275b_on_ai_startup_anthropic_its/";"Amazon is making its largest outside investment in its three-decade history as it looks to gain an edge in the artificial intelligence race.   The tech giant said it will spend another $2.75 billion backing Anthropic, a San Francisco-based startup that’s widely viewed as a frontrunner in generative artificial intelligence. Its foundation model and chatbot Claude competes with OpenAI and ChatGPT.  The companies announced an initial $1.25 billion investment in September, and said at the time that Amazon would invest up to $4 billion. Wednesday’s news marks Amazon’s second tranche of that funding.  Amazon will maintain a minority stake in the company and won’t have an Anthropic board seat, the company said. The deal was struck at the AI startup’s last valuation, which was $18.4 billion, according to a source.   Over the past year, Anthropic closed five different funding deals worth about $7.3 billion — and with the new Amazon investment, the total exceeds $10 billion. The company’s product directly competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT in both the enterprise and consumer worlds, and it was founded by ex-OpenAI research executives and employees.  News of the Amazon investment comes weeks after Anthropic debuted Claude 3, its newest suite of AI models that it says are its fastest and most powerful yet. The company said the most capable of its new models outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini Ultra on industry benchmark tests, such as undergraduate level knowledge, graduate level reasoning and basic mathematics.  “Generative AI is poised to be the most transformational technology of our time, and we believe our strategic collaboration with Anthropic will further improve our customers’ experiences, and look forward to what’s next,” said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of data and AI at AWS.  Amazon’s move is the latest in a spending blitz among cloud providers to stay ahead in the AI race. And it’s the second update in a week to Anthropic’s capital structure. Late Friday, bankruptcy filings showed crypto exchange FTX struck a deal with a group of buyers to sell the majority of its stake in Anthropic, confirming a CNBC report from last week.  The term generative AI entered the mainstream and business vernacular seemingly overnight, and the field has exploded over the past year, with a record $29.1 billion invested across nearly 700 deals in 2023, according to PitchBook. OpenAI’s ChatGPT first showcased the tech’s ability to produce human-like language and creative content in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has said more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted the platform, spanning industries such as financial services, legal applications and education.  Cloud providers like Amazon Web Services don’t want to be caught flat-footed.  It’s a symbiotic relationship. As part of the agreement, Anthropic said it will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. It will also use Amazon chips to train, build and deploy its foundation models. Amazon has been designing its own chips that may eventually compete with Nvidia.   Microsoft has been on its own spending spree with a high-profile investment into OpenAI. Microsoft’s OpenAI bet has reportedly jumped to $13 billion as the startup’s valuation has topped $29 billion. Microsoft’s Azure is also OpenAI’s exclusive provider for computing power, which means the startup’s success and new business flows back to Microsoft’s cloud servers.  Google, meanwhile, has also backed Anthropic, with its own deal for Google Cloud. It agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic, comprising a $500 million cash infusion, with another $1.5 billion to be invested over time. Salesforce is also a backer.  Anthropic’s new model suite, announced earlier this month, marks the first time the company has offered “multimodality,” or adding options like photo and video capabilities to generative AI.  But multimodality, and increasingly complex AI models, also lead to more potential risks. Google recently took its AI image generator, part of its Gemini chatbot, offline after users discovered historical inaccuracies and questionable responses, which circulated widely on social media.  Anthropic’s Claude 3 does not generate images: instead, it only allows users to upload images and other documents for analysis.  “Of course no model is perfect, and I think that’s a very important thing to say upfront,” Anthropic co-founder Daniela Amodei told CNBC earlier this month. “We’ve tried very diligently to make these models the intersection of as capable and as safe as possible. Of course there are going to be places where the model still makes something up from time to time.”  Amazon’s biggest venture bet before Anthropic was electric vehicle maker Rivian, where it invested more than $1.3 billion. That too, was a strategic partnership.   These partnerships have been picking up in the face of more antitrust scrutiny. A drop in acquisitions by the Magnificent Seven — Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla — has been offset by an increase in venture-style investing, according to Pitchbook.  AI and machine-learning investments from those seven tech companies jumped to $24.6 billion last year, up from $4.4 billion in 2022, according to Pitchbook. At the same time, Big Tech’s M&A deals fell from 40 deals in 2022 to 13 last year.   “There is a sort of paranoia motivation to invest in potential disruptors,” Pitchbook AI analyst, Brendan Burke, said in an interview. “The other motivation is to increase sales, and to invest in companies that are likely to use the other company’s product — they tend to be partners, more so than competitors.”  Big Tech’s spending spree in AI has come under fire for the seemingly circular nature of these agreements. By investing in AI startups, some, including Benchmark’s Bill Gurley have accused the tech giants of funneling cash back to their cloud businesses, which in turn, may show up as revenue. Gurley described it as a way to “goose your own revenues.”  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is taking a closer look at these partnerships, including Microsoft’s OpenAI deal and Google and Amazon’s Anthropic investments. What’s sometimes called “round tripping” can be illegal — especially if the aim is to mislead investors. But Amazon has said that this type of venture investing does not constitute round tripping.  FTC Chair Lina Khan announced the inquiry during the agency’s tech summit on AI, describing it as a “market inquiry into the investments and partnerships being formed between AI developers and major cloud service providers.”  Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/27/amazon-spends-2point7b-on-startup-anthropic-in-largest-venture-investment.html";"639";"2024-03-27T17:54:55"

"I think this was Amazon when it was $10 [PDD]";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bbcgqa/i_think_this_was_amazon_when_it_was_10_pdd/";"Wanted to share my due diligence on a stock that is in my portfolio, PinDuoDuo Holdings. I caught a hold of this stock when I was researching BABA, and found out that PDD was not only profitable but was growing 50% + YOY and was also profitable. This got me deep-diving into the stock. I started accumulating after it rebounded at the bottom around $65 and recently added more to the position given the recent correction.     **Business Operations**   PDD is an E-commerce business located in China. Their main competitors consist of major players as such Alibaba & [Jd.com](http://Jd.com) but have been snatching a tremendous amount of market share. There are a few key reasons why PDD has been striving so well.  1. With the current recession in China, everybody has been trying to save more and spend less and PDD does exactly just that. They gamify the buying experience for the users, encouraging families and friends to join in on a “group-buy” to get it for a cheaper price. The reason they are able to charge at such competitive prices is they handle directly with the supplier/manufacturer to deliver the goods and attain special prices. PDD handles every single process of the logistics, cutting out unnecessary middlemen. Alibaba also does this with their “Cainiao” logistics company but I think it is less integrated than PDD’s process. This is very clear from the gross margin difference of around 60-75% compared to Alibaba’s 35-40% and also a much higher return on invested capital at 25% and compared to 10%. 2. They focus heavily on their agriculture program. Farmers do not have the best connections/resources, therefore they usually make very thin margins. With PDD they directly engage with the farmers to cut out any unnecessary middleman. They spent 10 billion RMB to create an agriculture program to help address some of the agricultural needs in the country. Once new farmers hit the market, they can receive digital training to become a seller on the platform. This would be a further tailwind for growth in the future. As far as I know, PDD is the only player in the market with this initiative.  **Valuation (PDD)**   PDD is extremely cheap for a company that is growing this fast. In Q32023 PDD generated RMB 68.840 Billion with a net income of RMB 15.537 Billion. The same time the previous year they generated RMB 35.504 Billion with a net income of RMB 10.589. That is a revenue growth of 94% & earnings growth of 46%! Best part is that they barely dilute the stock which means shareholders retain nearly all of those earnings.  **Here's my DCF Assumption:**   **FCF Growth Year 1 to 3:** 30% CAGR, **Year 4 to 6:** 22% CAGR, **Year 7-10:** 18% CAGR   **Outstanding** S**hares(Projected):** 1,631,000,000   **Discount Rate:** 16%   **Intrinsic Value:** $132.64/Share   Now you might say that the discount to the current share price today ($110) does not feel like it gives enough of a margin of safety, however do keep note that I am heavily sandbagging the future growth of this company(they are expected to grow 80% next year) and this already with an extreme discount rate. If you would apply an industry standard of 10% discount rate the intrinsic value of the stock would be **$289/Share!** Of course, there is a reason why I heavily sandbagged the stock which I will explain in the next section.      **Risks of Chinese Equities**   With the recession happening in China, everything including stocks, and properties have been on a fire sale and getting cheaper for the past 2 years. Even though the fundamentals of the stock are good it can get cheaper for no good reason. Look at JD, it is trading below book value even though cashflow growth is still there, yielding an insane 25% free cash flow. Now investing in PDD might still be viable because despite the recession, it is still growing very fast and is very profitable, so it is somewhat negated this side of the risk slightly.   Another risk that I have to mention is the VIE structure. When you invest in PDD, you technically do not own shares of the company. You own an entity with a holding company that has made a contract for PDD to distribute profits to that holding company you do not technically own shares of the company. The reason for the is because of the restrictions the CCP has imposed on foreign investments so this is a loophole for international investors. The only reason why PDD is still operating this way is because the CCP closes an eye on these VIE entities. At any moment they could implement a new regulation and completely render the shares worthless.   Even with the risks I have mentioned, the tech crackdown had already been over for 2 years and the CCP has been inviting people to invest again in China, therefore the risk of the VIE structure falling apart is quite low IMHO.      **Other things to take note off**   - 36.8% Institutional Ownership   - 33.6% Insider Ownership (That’s good)   - 29% Return on Invested Capital TTM   - Net Debt is zero  **Conclusion**   Even though the geopolitical risks are there, I think the prospect of the business can continue to thrive even in a recession. With strong growth and profitability, my hope is that PDD can continue to gain market share from its competitors and become a trillion dollar stock in the future. Cheers.";"0";"2024-03-10T16:07:29"
"Amazon (AMZN) DCF Analysis";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bk5tag/amazon_amzn_dcf_analysis/";"***NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE***  Before I start, I should preface by saying that I understand that AMZN is a good stock in general, my post will not be on why AMZN is good. But beyond that, I'd also like to explore whether or not AMZN is over/undervalued, it is possible to be a good stock but still overvalued.   # Introduction:  AMZN has built a strong business model, creating a global logistics network to connect consumers to sellers all over the world. This behemoth of a business inadvertently makes AMZN irreplaceable in our day-to-day life, the convenience and speed at which AMZN offers its services is unparalleled by many companies. Because the company takes a long-term view on returns, it chooses to forfeit short-term gains for longer-term returns. On top of its logistics business, AMZN is also involved in cloud computing the next frontier with large growth potential, all these show the forward-thinking acumen its leaders have.  # Investment Thesis:  ***Established Logistics Network***   AMZN’s most compelling competitive advantage is that it has an established global logistics network that no other company can replicate without substantial monetary and time investment, through controlling its own logistics network by purchasing its own cargo ships and leasing planes ([SOURCE](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/04/how-amazon-beats-supply-chain-chaos-with-ships-and-long-haul-planes.html)). AMZN can control where the ship docks which allows them to be more efficient with their cost through avoiding busy ports.       ***Strong Reverse Logistics***   Consumers increasingly perceive easy & free returns as essential ([SOURCE](https://www.powerreviews.com/research/reduce-returns/)). A very large C.A. for AMZN is its established reverse logistics as evidenced by AMZN being able to offer free return shipping for such a large volume of goods due to them expanding the scale of their reverse logistics that it makes economical sense for them to be able to offer these services for free. AMZN has also increased the ease of returning products, for example, by using UPS stores as a physical retail location where customers can drop off their parcels. UPS is reliant on AMZN as well, accounting for 11% of UPS revenue which gives AMZN large leverage over UPS ([SOURCE](https://www.wsj.com/business/fedex-amazon-discuss-returns-4325af30?st=oo1tomj716vco8d&reflink=article_copyURL_share))      How retailers manage their reverse logistics is also important as it is an additional outlet of significant revenue source. A few notable strides that AMZN is taking in this front is FBA Grade and Sell, where AMZN grades the item that buyers returned and grades it. Afterward, 3P Sellers (FBA Sellers) set the price based on the condition of the product.       ***Branding Goodwill***   Even though in recent years a few large e-commerce platforms have appeared such as Taobao, Shoppee, and Alibaba. AMZN has managed to maintain its reputation as a place that consumers will turn to if they want to get high-quality, safe, and reliable products that would not be flimsy or poorly made. The main reason why people use Taobao or Alibaba is because it is a website to get quasi items at a fraction of the price ([SOURCE](https://ec4ulimited.com/advantages-disadvantages-taobao-shopping/#:~:text=Goods%20from%20Taobao%20are%20cheap,for%20same%20or%20similar%20items)). Consumers have grown to accept the compromise in quality in exchange for a discount, this may be great in an economic downturn but during an average or booming macro environment, it ends up becoming a disadvantage. On top of that, by competing on price Taobao and Alibaba in the long run is unable to earn much margins and reinvest substantially to grow their business at a pace comparable to AMZN.  # Revenue:  ***Retail Sales***   Retail sales refer to AMZN’s online marketplace and physical stores.    AMZN has such large economies of scale that they can offer higher quality products for cheaper. “Amazon prices are 13% cheaper than other retailers for essential items.” ([SOURCE](https://www.grocerygazette.co.uk/2022/11/16/amazon-prices-cheaper-retailer/#:~:text=Amazon%20prices%2013%25%20cheaper%20than%20other%20retailers%20for%20essential%20items,-FMCGNewsSupermarkets&text=Amazon%20prices%20are%20an%20average,a%20new%20study%20has%20revealed)). On top of that, the increasing convenience of AMZN through speedier delivery increases the appeal of AMZN. “more than 90 percent of consumers expect two- to three-day delivery as the norm, while 30 percent expect same-day delivery.” ([SOURCE](https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/treasury-payments/insights/why-shopping-has-changed-forever)).    AMZN can achieve higher rates of same-day delivery due to their strategy called “regionalization”, where they store items closer to customers. This results in customers choosing AMZN to deliver their everyday shopping needs as AMZN can get them their items significantly faster. Regionalization also allows AMZN to save on cost which in turn allows AMZN to offer a wider variety of items at a lower Average Selling Price (ASP) profitably. On top of that, AMZN has also released RUFUS an interactive AI model that allows the user to chat with it to get more personalized recommendations based on the consumer's diverse requirements.     AMZN's next frontier of growth comes from India, where it is building out a logistics network to be able to serve rural customers in India. However, AMZN has recently invested heavily in its fulfillment network by doubling it. ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-doubled-fulfillment-network-since-202622130.html)) So, I assumed that AMZN would slow down growth plans to capitalize on their new fulfillment network fully. India represents a very strong growth opportunity given the high smartphone penetration rate of India, the rapid growth of the Indian economy, and their large population ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/467163/forecast-of-smartphone-users-in-india/)), this culmination of factors makes India a very lucrative market for AMZN to expand in.   When forecasting Average Monthly Traffic, I took into account ([SOURCE](https://www.sellzone.com/the-state-of-amazon-2022-key-data-insights-trends-to-watch/)). I assumed that as AMZN’s fulfillment network gets more comprehensive their monthly traffic increases as AMZN’s value proposition increases. I assumed that AMZN expands its fulfillment network significantly every 5 years.   When forecasting Sales/Monthly Traffic, as AMZN begins targeting more price-conscious countries, I assumed that AMZN’s sales/monthly traffic did not grow due to AMZN raising prices and only grew in line with the perpetual inflation rate. However, in the longer run as AMZN becomes more entrenched in these countries’ consumer habits I assumed that AMZN has larger price-setting abilities.      ***Third Party Sales (3P)***   Third Party Sales (3P) refers to the %sales AMZN earns as commission from third party sellers that sell on AMZN’s website.       The appeal of AMZN to retailers is that retailers can reach a massive audience very easily and can glean valuable insights on their products from the tools that AMZN platforms provide. Listing on AMZN also adds a layer of credibility and convenience, especially for Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) sellers.      When forecasting 3P Gross Merchandise Value, I took into account ([SOURCE](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazon-sales-top-700-billion-in-2023)). Opting for less granularity I forecasted GMV as a % of historic averages. As AMZN expands into more markets I expect this GMV to increase as there are now more sellers that are attracted to the services provided by AMZN.      When forecasting %GMV Earned, I assumed that AMZN slowly begin taking up a larger portion of the pie as AMZN would build a very strong value proposition to sellers and sellers would grow increasingly reliant on AMZN’s platform. However, I assumed modest growth as AMZN has to remain attractive to sellers by not cutting too much into their margins.     ***Advertising***   Advertising refers to ad revenue AMZN earns from advertisers to advertise on AMZN’s platform.   When forecasting Advertising, there is a lack of suitable data to forecast advertising, and the success of advertising hinges on the success of retail. Opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of retail revenue.   ***Subscription***    Subscription refers to AMZN’s subscription service, Amazon Prime.   When forecasting number of subscribers, taking into account ([SOURCE](https://www.yaguara.co/amazon-prime-statistics/#:~:text=There%20are%20230%20million%20Amazon,through%20Prime%20membership%20in%202023)). I believe that NFLX is a very strong competitor having dedicated their entire business model exclusively to content acquisition and marketing compared to AMZN which has a lot of other businesses that they need to pay attention to. I believe a significant portion of subscribers are purchasing Prime Video as an add-on to Amazon Prime rather than just for Prime Video alone. On top of that, in foreign countries where local broadcasters are still in a strong position, it’s tougher for AMZN to break into so I believe that Amazon Prime subscribers will not grow at an aggressive pace. In the past few years, with the backdrop of a poor macro-environment AMZN’s subscribers numbers Y/Y growth rate declined evident that Amazon Prime is perceived as a luxury good or an item placed in low priority.   When forecasting churn rate, taking into account ([SOURCE](https://churnkey.co/blog/churn-rates-for-streaming-services/)). Opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages. However, I believe that AMZN’s churn rate is higher than it should be due to the influx of new subscribers trying out Amazon Prime for the first time. So, over time I believe that as consumers get used to using Amazon Prime and develop a reliance on the service I believe that the churn rate tends downwards. So I assumed that as AMZN enters into newer markets the value of Amazon Prime increases which incentivizes consumers to stay subscribed to Amazon Prime.    When forecasting Annual Revenue/Member, as AMZN begins targeting more price-conscious countries, I assumed that AMZN’s Annual Revenue/Member did not grow due to AMZN raising prices in these countries and only in countries where AMZN has an established presence. So, this leads to the overall Y/Y growth rate being slower in the short run.  ***AWS***   AWS refers to AMZN’s cloud computing services. AWS offers SAAS and IAAS.      AWS has a strong first movers advantage, they started in 2006 whereas Google Cloud started in 2008 and Microsoft Azure started in 2010. I believe that AWS has had strong growth in recent history in part due to the chip shortage and a mass rush into AI Training that demanded a lot of chips, causing some companies to resort to renting more cloud GPUs from AMZN.     AMZN’s Gen AI strategy has 3 layers. The first layer is targetting the training and inference market for AI. The second layer (Amazon Bedrock) offers large numbers of foundational LLM that businesses can use and develop according to their needs, allowing customers to experiment with different models to optimize experience and cost. The third layer is (Amazon Q) which functions similarly to ChatGPT.      Others   AMZN’s other revenue sources.       When forecasting Others, I forecasted it as a %retail sales as the success of Others hinges on the success of AMZN’s retail arm of business. Opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.  # Reality Check:  As a reality check for my forecast, I looked at the world’s GDP to figure out if the GMV for AMZN is in line with the total growth in goods and services in the world. As of 2023, AMZN’s GMV as a %World GDP is 0.5%. By 2040, the world GDP is at 153T ([SOURCE](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Global-GDP-could-rise-by-about-12-trillion-in-2040-an-8-percent-increase-mainly-from_fig1_346806184#:~:text=NonCommercial%204.0%20International-,Global%20GDP%20could%20rise%20by%20about%20%2412%20trillion%20in%202040,health%3A%20A%20prescription%20for%20prosperity)), I assumed that AMZN’s GMV as a %world GDP is 1.8%. This is realistic as over time, it would make sense for smaller players to sell their products on AMZN rather than rebuilding a new logistics network from the ground up. An example of smaller players using a much larger platform to sell is live stream commerce, which is prominent on platforms such as Douyin ([SOURCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj8vaCGq4WFAxWO1jgGHaqNBEQQFnoECBMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.statista.com%2Fstatistics%2F1174906%2Fchina-gmv-of-live-streaming-commerce-on-douyin%2F&usg=AOvVaw1RJ3TKxYD-m8lPZtrTMtRz&opi=89978449)).      The total world population as of 2023 is at 8.05 billion ([SOURCE](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/)), and monthly Traffic as of 2023 as a % of the total world population is at 32.92%. By 2043, the world population will grow to 9.36 billion ([SOURCE](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/world-population-projections/)), I assumed that AMZN’s monthly traffic as a %world population is 49.67%.      I believe that these assessments are realistic given that I am expecting AMZN to expand its logistics network about 6x over 20 years, increasing its reach far beyond its domestic reach in the US. The speed of expansion is logical too given that AMZN was able to double its logistics network 2x over 2 years.   # Cost:  ***COGS***  When forecasting COGS, Regionalization has reduced the distance needed by AMZN to deliver their item to customers, in turn saving cost.       ***G&A***  When forecasting G&A, I took into account the number of employees. AMZN has been reducing headcount over the past few years, as AMZN overhired during COVID-19 to keep up with the raging demand.       When forecasting Cost/Employee, as AMZN is in money-saving mode I assumed that they continued the historic trend of cutting down Cost/Employee for the next 2 years before growing in line with the perpetual inflation rate.      ***R&D***  When forecasting R&D, R&D was capitalized. To determine the useful life I looked at what the majority of the spending was on, “Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented.” and  “The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.5 years.” - 2023 Q4 10-K. So, I assumed that the main expenditure came from capitalized video content, and applying the conservatism principle, the amortization was rounded down to 3 years.  # Change in NWC:  When forecasting change in NWC as AMZN recently rolled out their regionalization efforts in FY23, the impact on Day Inventory may be very apparent and should be assumed as the status quo going forward.  # D&A and CapEX:  When forecasting Amortization and Content Amortization, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.      When forecasting Content Acquisition and CapEX, I assumed that as AMZN expands its reach the CapEX spending increases before regressing to below historic averages.   # WACC:  “The weighted-average remaining term of the financing obligations was 17.9 years and 17.0 years and the weighted-average imputed interest rate was 3.1% as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.” - 2023 Q4 10-K    10Y T-Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 4.31%   Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/)) = 1.17   Stable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%   COE = 9.69%   AMZN is rated “AA-” ([SOURCE](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-affirms-amazoncom-inc-at-aa-outlook-stable-20-06-2023))   AA Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 5.03%   Marginal Tax Rate = 21.00%   AT-COD = 3.97%   Stock Price (5D Avg) = $173.97   Shares O/S = 10387.38M   Market Value of Equity = 1807092.50M   Weighted Average Maturity = 17.0 Years   FY23 Debt Obligation = 67150M   Interest Expense = 2081.65M   Market Value of Debt = 60026.19M   %Debt = 3.21%   %Equity = 96.79%   %WACC = 9.48%     # Conclusion:  Ultimately, in my base case, I value AMZN at $155.67 per share. I believe that AMZN is still overvalued despite it being a good company. This overvaluation of AMZN is a direct result of AMZN posting high free cash flow in recent quarters which gave investors the confidence that AMZN is capable of deriving positive free cash flow from its business. However, most of this positive cash flow was derived from their high margins AWS and advertising increasing substantially Y/Y. This could mean that positive cash flows are a cyclical occurrence as cloud computing is reliant on the volatile AI market and advertising is a cyclical industry that relies on macro-conditions. I believe that there is a strong case for AMZN to break beyond its current market valuation, but for it to be successful will be dependent on how the Indian market reacts to it and if AMZN is able to restart its push in the China market.

"I think this year and beyond, Amazon $AMZN will have record cash flow and record stock price, and here is why";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b5vuxf/i_think_this_year_and_beyond_amazon_amzn_will/";"Background: I am a 3rd party seller who sells private label goods on Amazon. I gross annually between $1-2mil in revenue. At first many sellers and I kind of brushed off this new policy change that was initiated on March 1st, 2024. However once digging deeper into it and making shipments to send into Amazon, I realized how much of a vulture Amazon truly is. As much as I absolutely hate these changes, and I hope FTC investigates the shit out of them, this is extremely bullish for Amazon's cashflow perspective.      https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/headlines.html?id=GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5&ref=nslp\_at\_33\_GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5\_en-US\_ttl\_rf\_recent\_news\_34https://www.ecomcrew.com/amazon-fba-big-fee-increase-2024/      Analysis:      Amazon's recent strategic adjustments are poised to enhance its profitability significantly through the expansion of the Amazon Global Logistics Program and modifications to its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) policies. Here's a breakdown of why these changes will benefit Amazon financially:      Expansion of Amazon Global Logistics Program:- What it is: Amazon Global Logistics is a comprehensive shipping and logistics service that facilitates international shipping for sellers on Amazon's platform. It handles cargo from the point of origin to Amazon warehouses worldwide, including sea, air, and land transportation.      \- Impact: Given that 60-70% of Amazon's third-party sellers are from China, and a substantial portion of private label goods on Amazon are imported from China, the expansion of this program positions Amazon as a key logistics provider for international sellers. By handling sea shipping directly, Amazon eliminates the need to pay third-party shipping companies, thus capturing more revenue from the logistics and shipping process.      ""Voluntary"" Use of Amazon Warehouse Distribution (AWD) for FBA Sellers:  \- What it is: Amazon's policy now encourages third-party FBA sellers to use its Amazon Warehouse Distribution system, compelling them to store inventory in Amazon's warehouses, which incurs storage fees, inbound fees, and other charges. Amazon will then automatically distribute its inventory to FBA warehouses as it deem fit.      \- Impact: This move ensures a consistent revenue stream from storage and handling fees paid by sellers. Additionally, sellers are faced with significant penalties for not using AWD, such as high inventory placement fees or the logistical burden of distributing inventory across multiple locations in the USA. (Before this, sellers can usually send all its inventory to one warehouse to save on cost, but that's no longer the case). This strategy not only generates more revenue from fees but also reduces Amazon's costs by shifting the inventory distribution burden to sellers. The average inventory placement cost per box will be about $25-$50. This is absolutely ridiculous.      Implementation of Extra Fulfillment Fees for Low Inventory:      \- What it is: Amazon has introduced an additional fulfillment fee for sellers who maintain less than 28 days of inventory in Amazon's warehouses. This fee, a minimum of $0.89 per unit, penalizes sellers for not keeping a sufficient stock, especially for high-demand items.      \- Impact: This policy directly impacts sellers' profit margins, especially for those selling products at lower price points. For example, a $9.99 item with a profit margin of $2, selling 10,000 units a month, this extra charge significantly eats into profits. The intent behind keeping inventory levels lean—to avoid excessive storage fees—now results in additional costs through fulfillment fees.      This policy effectively forces sellers to either risk running low on inventory and incurring extra fees or overstock to avoid these penalties, leading to higher storage fees. What's even more fucked up about it is that Amazon fulfillment centers usually checks in our shipments late. This means that if I have shipment that was delivered to Amazon Warehouse (Say enough inventory to cover 40 days) but not checked in, and I only have 30 days of inventory left, now I will have to pay extra fee because of ""low inventory"" even though it takes forever for Amazon to process your inventory. I have multiple shipments that's been delivered for about 3 weeks now, and they are still not checked in.      \- Strategic Benefit for Amazon: By charging extra for fulfillment when inventory levels fall below a certain threshold, Amazon not only generates additional revenue but also pressures sellers to maintain higher inventory levels, thereby increasing the use of Amazon's storage facilities. This policy, combined with the ""voluntary"" use of Amazon's Inventory Placement service for restocking, which incurs additional fees, further ties sellers into Amazon's logistics ecosystem. It incentivizes the use of Amazon's AWD system, underlining Amazon's strategy to centralize control over logistics and distribution, enhancing its revenue streams from logistical and warehousing services while also potentially reducing operational complexities and costs.      \*\*Overall Financial Impact:\*\*These backend changes significantly reduce operational costs for Amazon by streamlining logistics and warehouse operations. Simultaneously, they increase revenue through logistics services, storage, and handling fees. By centralizing control over logistics and storage, Amazon not only saves on the costs of dealing with external logistics providers but also capitalizes on the fees charged to sellers. This dual approach of cutting costs and boosting revenue streams is poised to enhance Amazon's profitability in the competitive e-commerce and logistics sectors.      Again, I hope Lina Khan investigates the shit out of Amazon for using this bullshit tactic, but it is what it is. This is going to be extremely bullish for Amazon as it cuts costs while strengthen its global logistics empire.      Bonus: Amazon Advertising is also a bunch of bullshit (In terms of as a gigantic cash cow for them). The suggested bids for keywords are usually 2x higher than the actual bid needed to get top spots. This makes uninformed sellers spend a crap on advertising everyday. Just for perspective, I have about 12 products in my private label brand, and I spend on average $300-$500 a day. YES EVERY SINGLE DAY. That's about $110k to $190k a year just in ads. This is extremely high margin business for Amazon because they don't have to do anything. In addition, by Amazon running Ads on most prime video accounts, they will make on average $10/month per user. They also signed deals with NFL to exclusively stream their games. As much as I hate them, the future for Amazon is only up.      Extra bonus: Amazon already handles majority of packages in the US. By a click of a button, they can easily start taking marketshare from both UPS and Fedex by offering shipping to everyday people. They can utilize their wholefoods or kohl's location to receive and ship packages. Or they could also offer franchise opportunities to mom-pop shipping/packaging stores just like how UPS and Fedex has it.      Position: 20% of my portfolio is now in AMZN. Even at ATH, I plan to change to 50% weighted in Amazon... This is pissing me off, but I gotta find a way to get my money back somehow.";"370";"2024-03-04T00:39:24"

"Amazon Prime has framework deal for NBA broadcast rights";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ce00pf/amazon_prime_has_framework_deal_for_nba_broadcast/";"In what will be a landmark move in sports media history, the NBA and Amazon Prime Video have the framework of a deal that will make the streaming service one of the main homes for the league’s games, executives with direct knowledge of the talks told The Athletic.  It is expected that Prime Video’s package will include significant regular-season and postseason games, perhaps even some conference finals. The anticipation is that the final contract will be for at least a decade and begin the 2025-2026 season.  ESPN/ABC, as the website Puck reported Thursday, also has a framework of a deal with the expectations that an agreement will be completed. ESPN/ABC is expected to keep the NBA Finals on its networks for the duration of its deals. Like Amazon, ESPN’s new contract also is expected to be at least a decade in length.  All of the details are not finalized yet, but all sides are under the expectations they will get done. The NBA, Amazon and ESPN all declined to comment.  The NBA prefers to have three companies involved in its new deals but has not ruled out adding a fourth.  The NBA is finishing nine-year deals that pay it $2.6 billion on average from ESPN and TNT Sports. Those contracts end after the 2024-2025 season.  The advancement in the Amazon and ESPN talks leaves incumbent Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns network TNT Sports, to face off with NBC, owned by Comcast, for the likely last package of games. Warner Bros. Discovery has the right to match deals, but NBC could structure an agreement in a way that makes it difficult.  While there is still work to be completed for the final arrangements, the current packages are going to be pruned slightly to create the third partner. In one arrangement, ESPN will cut down from around 100 games to around 80, according to executives briefed on the talks.  A natural landing spot for Amazon’s regular-season games could be Thursday night, where it already has the NFL from September to early January. In recent years, the NBA has moved its games off Thursday during that time to not go head-to-head with the NFL. It is expected to then have significant playoff inventory. Amazon has shown interest in global rights, which has been a key part of the NBA’s negotiating strategy as it lined all of its domestic and international deals to end following the 2024-2025 season.  The NBA has made it clear that it wanted to define itself for the next frontier of viewing with streaming at the forefront.  With ESPN, Amazon and the NBA all under the impression that they will complete deals, this puts the onus on TNT Sports, which has had the NBA since 1984. It is in a fight with NBC, which was the lead partner of the NBA before losing its rights in 2002. NBC, with its streaming service Peacock, wants back in and is competing with Warner Bros. Discovery Sports for a deal.  Source: https://theathletic.com/5450064/2024/04/26/nba-broadcasting-rights-amazon-prime-video/";"74";"2024-04-27T01:33:36"
"Amazon to invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, a rival to ChatGPT developer OpenAI";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16rmvdx/amazon_to_invest_up_to_4_billion_in_anthropic_a/";"E-commerce giant Amazon on Monday said it will invest up to $4 billion in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic and take a minority ownership position in the company.The move underscores Amazon’s aggressive AI push as it looks to keep pace with rivals such as Microsoft and Alphabet’sGoogle.  Anthropic was founded roughly two years ago by former OpenAI research executives and recently debuted its new AI chatbot called Claude 2. Amazon is looking to capitalize on the hype and promise of so-called generative AI, which includes technology like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, as well as Anthropic’s Claude chatbots.  The two firms on Monday said that they are forming a strategic collaboration to advance generative AI, with the startup selecting Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider. Anthropic said it will provide AWS customers with early access to unique features for model customization and fine-tuning capabilities.  Anthropic will also use custom AWS-designed semiconductors to train the foundational models that underpin its AI applications. Foundation models are large AI programs trained on vast amounts of data so that they can be adapted to solve a wide range of tasks.   This year, chip firm Nvidia is the chip firm that has seen the biggest gains from the generative AI boom. Nvidia’s key product is a type of semiconductor known as a graphics processing unit, which can be used to train huge AI models. At one point Nvidia’s stock had rallied more than 200%, as the company smashed through financial forecasts on the rising adoption of AI.  To an extent, Amazon’s deal with Anthropic aims to show that there are alternative chips that can be used for AI applications. AWS customers will be able to build on Anthropic’s AI models via Amazon Bedrock — a service that lets customers build generative AI applications in the cloud via existing models, rather than train their own models.  Amazon is looking to position itself as the one-stop shop for AI. The e-commerce giant designs its own chips for training huge AI models. Through Amazon Bedrock customers can also design their own generative AI applications using existing models, which are all run on the Amazon cloud. The company sells its own AI applications too.  Anthropic already counts some high-profile backers, including Google and Salesforce Ventures. This support comes as tech giants continue to make massive bets on AI companies, a move sparked by Microsoft’s multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI in January.  https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/25/amazon-to-invest-up-to-4-billion-in-anthropic-a-rival-to-chatgpt-developer-openai.html";"461";"2023-09-25T11:01:26"

In the company’s earnings call following the release of Q1 results, CEO Andy Jassy and CFO Brian Olsavsky spent a significant amount of time on the company’s plans for AI and the expectation to “meaningfully” increase spending on the technology.      “We’re seeing strong demand signals from our customers on the AWS side,” Olsavsky said, adding that “they’re signing longer deals with larger commitments, many with generative AI components.” Olsavsky added that the generative AI business now represents a “multi-billion dollar revenue run rate business for Amazon,” while AWS is expected to grow to $100B in annualized revenue. The unit generated a profit of $9.42B in Q1 with a 37.6% operating margin.      “Eighty-five percent or more of the global IT spend remains on-premises. This is before you even calculate gen AI, most of which will be created over the next 10-20 years from scratch and on the cloud. There’s a very large opportunity in front of us,” Jassy said.      As for the other businesses, Jassy noted that the newer investments like international stores, third-party logistics business offerings such as buy with Prime, Amazon shipping and multi-channel fulfillment continues to show promising growth. The company also said it was launching a smaller Whole Foods market concept in Manhattan called Whole Foods Market Daily Shop.      The ad business saw sales climb an impressive 24% year-over-year driven by sponsored products and supported by continued improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers.      “We still see significant opportunity ahead in our sponsored products, as well as areas where we’re just getting started like Prime Video Ads,” Jassy said. And while it's early for streaming TV ads, Jassy is encouraged by the early response.";"62";"2024-05-01T01:10:02"

"Amazon launches same-day prescription delivery in New York and Los Angeles";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bo5xkp/amazon_launches_sameday_prescription_delivery_in/";"Amazon’s effort to get customers in the two largest U.S. markets whatever they want on the day of their order has expanded to include prescription drugs.  The e-commerce giant said on Tuesday that it’s rolling out same-day delivery of prescription medications in New York City and the greater Los Angeles area.  The prescriptions are offered via Amazon’s online pharmacy service, which launched in 2020. Amazon Pharmacy, born out of the company’s 2018 acquisition of online pharmacy PillPack, allows customers to order prescription medications for home delivery, with free shipping for Prime members.  To speed up deliveries, Amazon said it’s using new, smaller facilities, stocked with the most common prescription medications for acute conditions. The locations are equipped to process a prescription “within a matter of minutes rather than hours or days,” the company said.  “By bringing Amazon Pharmacy’s deliveries into our existing world-class logistics network, Amazon is building the fastest and most convenient service for the home delivery of prescription medications,” Doug Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores, said in a statement. “These faster delivery speeds will be a game changer when you or your family need your medications quickly.”  San Bernardino, Riverside and Anaheim, which are all in the LA area, are eligible for same-day prescription deliveries starting Tuesday. The broader LA metro area will be up and running in April. The company plans to add more than a dozen other cities by the end of the year.  In October, Amazon began offering same-day prescription medication delivery in Seattle, Miami, Indianapolis, Phoenix and Austin, Texas. At the same time, the company said it would start sending prescription medications via drone in College Station, Texas, one of the two cities where Amazon is dispatching unmanned aircrafts to deliver items weighing five pounds or less.  The company said it’s dispatching e-bikes to handle some Amazon Pharmacy deliveries in New York. Amazon has been experimenting with e-cargo delivery bikes, which can speed up deliveries and cut down on emissions, in the city for the past several years.

"Microsoft and Amazon to invest $5.6 billion into France as Macron courts tech giants ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cqzxdr/microsoft_and_amazon_to_invest_56_billion_into/";"Microsoft and Amazon are ploughing billions of dollars into France.  Microsoft said in a statement Monday that it’s committing 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) toward expanding its cloud and AI infrastructure in France, in addition to funding AI skilling and support for France’s technology industry.  The company said it plans to invest bring up to 25,000 of the most advanced GPUs, or graphics processing units, to France by the end of 2025. Microsoft will also train 1 million people up and support 2,500 AI startups by 2027.  The announcement was made during the “Choose France” summit, a gathering dedicated to encouraging foreign investment in France.  “This major investment demonstrates a steadfast commitment to supporting digital innovation and economic growth in France,” said Microsoft’s President Brad Smith in a statement Monday.  “We are building state-of-the-art Cloud and AI infrastructure, training people with AI skills, and supporting French startups as they use our technology with confidence to grow in a fair and responsible way.”  As part of its investment, Microsoft will also open a new data center in the French city of Mulhouse.  Amazon, meanwhile, made a commitment of its own to invest 1.2 billion euros in France.  The money will go toward creating more than 3,000 jobs in France — in addition to the 2,000 new jobs Amazon’s already announced for 2024 — as well as broadly increasing Amazon’s footprint in the country, according to Frederic Duval, Amazon’s country manager.  “The expansion of our logistics network supports local economic development, creates quality jobs and allows us to reduce the carbon footprint of our deliveries while improving the overall customer experience,” Duval said in a statement Monday.  Collectively, the commitments from Microsoft and Amazon to France amount to $5.6 billion of funding. In total, France reportedly bagged a record 15 billion euros of investment commitments from foreign companies at an annual “Choose France” summit on Monday.  French President Emmanuel Macron has been trying to promote France as an artificial intelligence hub. Paris is already a major center of AI research and development, with Facebook having established one of its main AI labs, FAIR, there in 2015.  Last year, at the VivaTech technology fair in Paris, Macron announced 500 million euros ($540 million) in new funding to create new AI “champions,” adding to previous commitments from the government, including a promise to pump 1.5 billion euros into AI before 2022.  Microsoft is also making a charm offensive of its own with its commitment to invest billions of euros into France at a time when French officials have expressed concerns with the Redmond, Washington-based tech giant’s investment in AI startup Mistral.  Microsoft recently made a 15 million euro investment into Mistral. The deal saw Microsoft getting a stake in Mistral and the latter adding its large language model to the technology giant’s Azure cloud computing platform.  Microsoft has pushed back on competition concerns surrounding its investment in Mistral, saying that the company remains independent and that its partnership is a minority equity investment and a commercial relationship, not a merger. Britain’s competition regulator is seeking feedback on the deal.  Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/13/amazon-and-microsoft-to-invest-5point6-billion-into-france.html";"166";"2024-05-13T15:55:57"
"Amazon gets boost from 72% pop in AI company Astera Labs' IPO";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bjwxo4/amazon_gets_boost_from_72_pop_in_ai_company/";"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy loves to talk about how much his company is benefiting from the artificial intelligence boom. On Wednesday, Amazon got an AI boost in a different way.  Shares of Astera Labs, which sells data center connectivity chips to cloud and AI infrastructure companies, soared 72% in their Nasdaq debut, closing at $62.03. That gives Astera a market cap of close to $9.5 billion.  Astera’s IPO plays into Wall Street’s thirst for all things AI. Founded in 2017 by former Texas Instruments executives, Astera counts Nvidia, AMD, and Intel among its customers. It’s also selling heavily to Amazon.  The company got a major vote of confidence in 2022, when it struck a deal with Amazon that gave the tech giant warrants allowing it to buy up to 1.5 million shares of Astera’s stock at $20.34 apiece. The following year, the agreement was amended, giving Amazon a warrant to buy more than 830,000 additional shares. As of the end of last year, Amazon controlled 232,608 shares, according to a securities filing.  Based on Wednesday’s closing price, Amazon’s shares and warrants are worth a total of almost $144 million.  But in order for Amazon to vest the rest of its shares and fully benefit from the price pop, it must purchase up to $650 million worth of Astera’s products in the coming years, according to the agreement. That’s a lot of money for Astera, which recorded total sales last year of $115.8 million, up from $79.9 million in 2022.  The three types of products Amazon has agreed to buy are are all designed to address “critical bottlenecks in AI infrastructure,” according to Astera’s IPO prospectus.  Astera is joining the public markets as investors eagerly await social media company Reddit’s planned New York Stock Exchange debut Thursday. The tech IPO market has been largely dormant since late 2021, with Arm Holdings, Instacart and Klaviyo among the very few that have held offerings over that stretch.

The Competition and Markets Authority said it determined the deal would not result in “a substantial lessening of competition” in the U.K. The CMA opened its probe into the proposed purchase in April.      iRobot’s stock surged 21% on news of the CMA’s approval. Amazon shares closed down 1%.      An Amazon spokesperson told CNBC in a statement: “We’re pleased with the UK Competition and Markets Authority’s decision and are committed to supporting regulatory bodies in their work. We look forward to similar decisions from other regulators soon.”      Amazon announced last year it would acquire iRobot for $1.7 billion, as part of a move to deepen its presence in the smart home. But the deal is still under review by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, as well as European Union antitrust regulators, who opened a probe earlier this month.      The CMA said it found in its review that iRobot’s market position in the U.K. is modest and that it faces significant competition from several rivals. It also determined the deal would not limit rival smart home platforms’ ability to compete and that there was no clear incentive for Amazon to favor iRobot’s products on its online store.

"Amazon breaks into Europe 5G networks with Telefonica cloud deal";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cmyn3k/amazon_breaks_into_europe_5g_networks_with/";"STOCKHOLM, May 8 (Reuters) - Telefonica Germany (TEF.MC) will move one million 5G customers to Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud later this month, company executives told Reuters, in a bold move by the U.S. online retailer to break into the global telecoms market.  While some telecom networks have moved IT and other non-core operations to the public cloud, the move by the subsidiary of Spanish group Telefonica is a global first where an existing mobile operator is switching its core network to a public cloud.  Big cloud-computing services firms such as Amazon (AMZN.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) have been trying to move more into the telecoms sector, lured by billions of dollars in potential revenue, but operators have been wary of the capability of public clouds in handling a mobile network.  ""I want to see it working for at least one to two quarters and have a roadmap to move at least 30-40% of my customer base by 2025-2026,"" said Mallik Rao, Chief Technology & Information Officer at O2 Telefonica, also known as Telefonica Germany.  The company has 45 million customers in Germany.  AWS and O2 Telefonica did not disclose financial details of the deal.  The core network, which consists of high-performance servers in data centers, is the heart of a mobile network that securely routes data and calls at high speeds. A public cloud will cut costs, increase scale and allow repairs to be done without service disruption.  U.S.-based Dish (DISH.MX), which built its mobile network from scratch, became in 2021 the only telecom company to use AWS cloud for core network.  ""Dish was much easier because they had no existing systems that had to be modified to work with the cloud,"" AWS vice president Jan Hofmeyr said in an interview.  Nokia, which also worked with Dish, will provide the software and AWS will provide its infrastructure for Telefonica.  Telefonica first worked with AWS and Ericsson, and then swapped to Nokia and AWS, Rao said. ""The days of trial are over. I don't want to keep on trying.""  The global telecom cloud market is expected to reach $108.7 billion by 2030 from $19.7 billion in 2021, making it a growth driver for companies such as Amazon.  ""We want to make it a business to run telco workloads,"" AWS' Hofmeyr said, adding that the company expects more deals with other operators in the next 12 months.  ""I would say in most cases the discussion is about timing versus should we move into the cloud.""

Amazon Web Services said Friday it will invest 2.3 trillion yen ($15 billion) in Japan by 2027 to expand its cloud infrastructure in Tokyo and Osaka to meet growing demand.  Japan has lagged behind in its generative artificial intelligence development but the government, and its tech companies, are battling to catch up.  Amazon is happy to help, and in the process expand its global footprint.  In May last year, the tech giant’s cloud unit pledged to invest $12.7 billion in India by 2030, again to meet growing demand for cloud services. That long-term commitment will take AWS’s total investment in India to $16.4 billion after it funded the launch of two data infrastructure regions in Mumbai and Hyderabad between 2016 and 2022.  Its Japanese endeavors have followed a similar blueprint, launching in Tokyo and 2011 and Osaka in 2021 before embarking on a major expansion in the years ahead.  Amazon previously said its 1.51 trillion yen cloud investment in Japan between 2011 and 2022 contributed 1.31 trillion yen in gross domestic product to the Japanese economy.  AWS’ cloud operations are now present in 12 regions in Asia Pacific and China—Hong Kong, Melbourne, Mumbai, Seoul, Sydney, Tokyo, Osaka, Beijing, Ningxia, Jakarta and Hyderabad, according to the company’s website.";"65";"2024-01-19T13:15:27"

Anyways my question can these companies grow their share prices when they already maximized their markets I mean how much more money can they make per year? I feel like it's a matter of holding on to key business to not lose to a competitor but as far as growth there is no more. So would that equate to the share prices hovering or slightly increasing? Like in the 90s apple had a small market with their desktops then in the early 2000s started ipods laptops then the iPhone there was so much of a market to expand upon and so much money to be made. Now everyone has an iPhone and MacBook its about keeping that consumer trend going.   So if I want to make the most out of investments I need to find companies that are like apple in early 2000s. Or can I put money in these giant companies and still see a lot of growth?

The Federal Trade Commission is alleging that the company is using its market power to stifle competition and harm consumers.      If the FTC is successful in its lawsuit, it could force Amazon to change its business practices and make it easier for third-party sellers to compete on the marketplace. The lawsuit could also have a broader impact on the tech industry, as it could signal a more aggressive approach to antitrust enforcement by the FTC.      The lawsuit, which is expected to be filed in the coming weeks, will focus on Amazon's core online marketplace.

It’s the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmaker’s stock soaring.  Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Google’s $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.  The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.  Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.  Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques — such as transformer architecture — used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.  Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a “code red” situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.

It struck splashy deals with Kim Kardashian, the Obamas and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. It paid $286 million for a pair of podcast studios and spent $250,000 and more an episode on exclusive shows to lure new listeners.   The bet hasn’t paid off.    Most of its shows aren’t profitable, according to people familiar with the matter, and the company has recently cut staff and programming to slow its losses. The company, which has struggled to report consistent profits, lost €527 million, equivalent to about $565 million, in the six months ending in June, on €6.2 billion in revenue.

"Disney needs to sell ESPN";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/183kxvd/disney_needs_to_sell_espn/";"The world has changed and Disney needs to too.  Sports TV contracts were historically insulated from competition due to network effects.  The sporting brands could get the biggest money by selling to the companies with the widest viewership. Those with the widest viewership could afford to pay the most as they spread many fixed costs over high amounts of ad revenue.  While this dynamic hasn’t changed, the ability to monetize by the competition has. Amazon’s distribution network will allow them to pay more than others for sports rights as products and services will run ads and those that sell go through Amazon’s network. Also with linear TV you may know X million saw your ad, but on the stream you know who was logged in, and know which of the logged in people scanned the QR code. Maybe they didn’t buy the item, but they can retarget you next time you open the app. You were watching the game after all. Amazon gets paid for the Ad on the original TV and paid again to retarget the ad and then to deliver the item. How is Disney or anyone else supposed to compete with that?  If Disney sold ESPN the remainder of their business would be replicateable by competition (at least directly). There is only one Star Wars and they own the rights to the whole boat. Their model becomes purely turn IP into multiple avenues of growth.  It’s like the famous scene in Spaceballs, merchandising merchandising, spaceballs the flamethrower, the lunchbox and so on.  They can take their content creation and then license the good brand image to others.  I’m not the first to make this claim, but the case is getting stronger.  Extra:  Also I would consider selling all news networks. You can’t leverage ABC and turn it into other avenues of growth like a stuffed animal or a theme park location. It would not shock me that NFLX as it builds their library goes more and more into the licensing world without any of the legacy costs of Disney.";"233";"2023-11-25T15:30:32"

The stock skyrocketed 430% in 2023, as of Wednesday’s close, outperforming all other U.S. tech companies valued at $5 billion or more. The next-best performer was Coinbase, which shot up 423% largely because of bitcoin’s rebound.

Shares of Affirm got a big boost in November after the company inked an expanded partnership with Amazon, and BNPL purchases hit an all-time high on Cyber Monday.  “The expectation was the consumer was going to be toast, unemployment was going to pick up and higher interest rates would destroy everything, and the exact opposite has happened on all fronts,” said Tom Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital, which doesn’t have a position in the stock. “So that’s why you have a scenario where Affirm can start to perform.”  https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/28/affirms-stock-quintupled-this-year-beating-all-tech-peers.html";"469";"2023-12-28T20:32:56"

"Google unveils custom Arm-based chips ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bzyx8m/google_unveils_custom_armbased_chips/";"Google is trying to make cloud computing more affordable with a custom-built Arm-based server chip. At its Cloud Next conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday, the company said the new processor will become available later in 2024.  With the new Arm-based chip, Google is playing catch-up with rivals such as Amazon and Microsoft, which have been employing a similar strategy for years. The tech giants compete fiercely in the growing market for cloud infrastructure, where organizations rent out resources in faraway data centers and pay based on usage.  Google parent Alphabet still derives three-quarters of revenue from advertising, but cloud is growing faster and now represents almost 11% of company revenue. The segment, which contains corporate productivity applications, is also profitable. Google held 7.5% of the cloud infrastructure market in 2022, while Amazon and Microsoft together controlled around 62%, according to Gartner estimates.  Market leader Amazon Web Services introduced its Graviton Arm chip in 2018. “Almost all their services are already ported and optimized on the Arm ecosystem,” Chirag Dekate, an analyst at technology industry researcher Gartner, told CNBC in an interview. Graviton has picked up business from Datadog, Elastic, Snowflake and Sprinklr, among others.  Alibaba announced Arm processors in 2021, and Microsoft did the same in November.  Arm isn’t completely new to Google, which started selling access to virtual machines, or VMs, that use Oracle-backed startup Ampere’s Arm-based chips earlier this year.  Porting applications to Arm machines has made sense for organizations seeking to reduce spending on cloud computing because of economic worries. When Arm Holdings filed to go public last year, it pointed to Amazon’s claim that Graviton could give up to 40% better price performance than comparable server instances, such as the common “x86” model used by AMD and Intel processors.  Google has used Arm-based server computers for internal purposes to run YouTube advertising, the BigTable and Spanner databases, and the BigQuery data analytics tool. The company will gradually move them over to the cloud-based Arm instances, which are named Axion, when they become available, a spokesperson said.  Datadog and Elastic plan to adopt Axion, along with OpenX and Snap, the spokesperson said.  Broader use of chips drawing on Arm’s architecture might lead to lower carbon emissions for certain workloads. Virtual slices of physical servers containing the Axion chips deliver 60% more energy efficiency than comparable VMs based on the x86 model, Google cloud chief Thomas Kurian wrote in a blog post. Arm chips, which are popular in smartphones, offer a shorter set of instructions than x86 chips, which are commonly found in PCs.  The chips can also speed up applications.  Axion offers 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based virtual machines in the cloud and 50% better performance than comparable VMs based on x86, Google said.  “I think it completes their portfolio,” Dekate said.

"Once a Hot Stock-Market Trend Has a Name, Its Best Days Are Likely to be over";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b3xvkb/once_a_hot_stockmarket_trend_has_a_name_its_best/";"Derek Horstmeyer(repost)  *Once a stock-market trend has been identified and named -- think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven -- the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.*      *To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Marín Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.*      *The final list of named trends we researched was:*      *-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.*      *-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.*      *-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.*      *-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestlé, L'Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.*      *-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.*      *-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.*      *-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.*      *-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce*      *Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.*      *From first mention*      *Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.*      *For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S&P 500.*      *The first interesting finding: When we look at the average of all these eight named trends, we see considerable price run-up before the trade being named. For the 24 months before the zero-date, we see the average named trend deliver 36% in excess returns. This means that if you magically knew about a new named trend before it happened, you could earn 36 percentage points above the S&P 500 for the two years before it was named.*      *Worth the ride, until...*      *But even if you don't have this magical foresight, it still doesn't hurt to ride a trend once it has been coined. On average, once the trend has been named and looking ahead 12 months, an investor can still earn about 13 percentage points in excess returns.*      *Yet 12 months following the naming is about the best you can do as returns peak at this point on average and decrease a bit subsequently. From the 12-month mark to the 24-month mark after a trend has been named, the average named trend lags behind the S&P 500 by about 2 percentage points.*      *When we look at the individual named trends, it might surprise people that the two best trades from the zero-date to the 24-month mark in our sample were the BAT and Cloud trends -- both earning more than 60% in excess return over the two-year period once they were coined by the press.*      *On the other end, the MT SAAS trade did the worst, dropping more than 95% in excess returns over the two-year period after being named.*      *All in all, this means your best option is to jump on a named trend as soon as you first hear about it -- provided you haven't been too late to the party -- and ride the initial momentum, if it happens. But if you get in past the 12-month mark, the returns might not be so magnificent.*";"158";"2024-03-01T17:04:21"

"Epic Games wins antitrust lawsuit against Google";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18g9t8e/epic_games_wins_antitrust_lawsuit_against_google/";" SAN FRANCISCO — Epic Games won an antitrust lawsuit against Google on Monday, in a landmark decision where a jury found Google broke competition laws in how it ran its app store.  The decision is a major blow to the tech giant and the concept that Big Tech companies should have complete control over how pricing and payments are done on their massive internet platforms. It could open up other challenges to how large tech companies govern their marketplaces, potentially forcing them to allow alternate payment processors. That could cut into revenue for Google and other companies like Apple and Amazon, which make money by charging fees on any transactions on their platforms.  In summer 2020, Epic had revolted against Apple and Google’s payment-sharing systems for app developers. Epic tweaked its popular Fortnite app so users could pay the company directly. First Apple, then Google, booted Fortnite from their app stores for violating terms. Epic sued both companies, arguing the rules violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/11/epic-google-trial-verdict/";"940";"2023-12-12T02:13:50"

Today the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) announced that Meta has been fined €1.2 billion (close to $1.3BN) — which the Board confirmed is the largest fine ever issued under the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). (The prior record goes to Amazon which was stung for $887M for misusing customers data for ad targeting back in 2021.)  Meta’s sanction is for breaching conditions set out in the pan-EU regulation governing transfers of personal data to so-called third countries (in this case the US) without ensuring adequate protections for people’s information.   European judges have previously found US surveillance practices conflict with EU privacy rights.  In a press release announcing today’s decision the EDPB’s chair, Andrea Jelinek, said:  > The EDPB found that Meta IE’s [Ireland’s] infringement is very serious since it concerns transfers that are systematic, repetitive and continuous. Facebook has millions of users in Europe, so the volume of personal data transferred is massive. The unprecedented fine is a strong signal to organisations that serious infringements have far-reaching consequences.  https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/22/facebook-eu-us-data-flows-decision/";"1760";"2023-05-22T13:04:54"

"Target launches paid membership program as it chases new revenue streams";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b77k5h/target_launches_paid_membership_program_as_it/";"Target on Tuesday said it will launch a paid membership program next month, riffing off the playbook of its rivals Amazon and Walmart.  The subscription tier, Target Circle 360, will include unlimited free same-day delivery for orders over $35 in as little as one hour with no delivery fees and two free-day shipping, along with other perks. The retailer will continue to offer its free Target Circle loyalty program that offers special deals and sales throughout the year.  Target did not immediately say how much it would cost.  The big-box retailer is turning to the new revenue stream as it tries to boost weaker sales. Its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue reported Tuesday beat Wall Street’s expectations, but its comparable sales have declined three quarters in a row.  With the move, Target is also following in the footsteps of retailers that have turned membership fees into a money maker and a sales driver. Amazon launched its Prime program in 2005, with perks like free two-day delivery and streaming of popular movies and original TV shows. It costs $139 per year or $14.99 per month, with the video membership-only option of $8.99 per month.  Walmart launched its program, called Walmart+, in 2020. It costs $98 per year or $12.95 per month, with perks like free shipping, free grocery deliveries for orders of at least $35 and gas discounts.  Target is turning to its competitors’ playbook for a reason: Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors on the company’s earnings call in February that Walmart+ members spend nearly twice as much as non-members and buy more over the course of a year.  Walmart has not said how many people subscribe to Walmart+, but its CFO John David Rainey said on the earnings call that its membership continues to grow by double-digit percentages.

Amazon's growth is impressive, driven by its expanding e-commerce reach in a market that's still not fully tapped. This juggernaut isn't slowing down anytime soon.  Apple's success lies in its thriving ecosystem, especially its booming services like Apple Music, iCloud or Apple TV. Innovations and strong financials keep it at the forefront, not just maintaining but possibly growing its market presence.  Microsoft stands strong with AI and cloud computing innovations. Its financial resilience and predicted growth in these sectors, along with gaming new bet, make it a likely candidate for continued success.  Berkshire Hathaway's diverse investments by one of the world best capital allocators underpin its steady growth. Their strategic planning and financial acumen, along with discussions on future leadership, suggest a stable and prosperous path ahead.

"Does $HIMS have a chance against $AMZN ???";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/174z99o/does_hims_have_a_chance_against_amzn/";" I am now convinced [$HIMS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMS&src=cashtag_click) is so undervalued due to [$AMZN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&src=cashtag_click) launching Amazon Clinic last month nationwide in the US. I have done some research on the competitive landscape Hims is up against!   1) Amazon Healthcare offers “multiple telehealth provider groups” who each set their own rates for service. The company says those visits will cost an average of $75. And $35 for a messaging session. (No insurance is accepted). I went through the sign up process for this, and it was similar to making an Amazon purchase - simple and quick. It's definitely a large competitive threat. But the platform is cut and dry and doesn't offer the educational material or specialized treatments that [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&src=cashtag_click) does. Additionally the brand may not ""feel"" trustworthy to some with their personal health information either, IMO. Amazon has work to do on their branding power in this space. Nonetheless, I have no doubt they will be a leader in the space.    2) Teledoc - works with all major insurance carriers. The website seems a decade or 2 old for the sign up process. [$TDOC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TDOC&src=cashtag_click) is a ""stayer"" in the space for the foreseeable future due to being grandfathered in with the insurance companies and regulators. The management has taken some large missteps recently in overpaying in purchasing other companies. I dont see them as a long term threat to [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&src=cashtag_click) because their innovation is lacking, and management does not seem like a bootstrapping company like [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&src=cashtag_click). Not to mention, their branding is B2B, so I get the impression they are not investing in their image/branding, which could hurt them later.    3) [$HIMS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMS&src=cashtag_click) has a major advantage in this space of being one of the only major founder led companies that is a fearless innovator. While being a company focused only on healthcare, dominating multiple segments in a short period, and starting to branch out into multiple segments. Further, the B2C branding, I believe, will help them win in the long run as they build trust with the public. I believe any telehealth company should invest in building this trust the same way your local hospital builds trust with their local community.    Conclusion- [$AMZN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&src=cashtag_click) is their largest competitive threat, IMO, but as [$NFLX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24NFLX&src=cashtag_click) has been able to survive/thrive in the streaming space against Amazon, I don't see any reason Hims can't do the same. I believe Hims is an exciting shopping experience where you can get expert information and personalized products at a great price. A great thing about [$HIMS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMS&src=cashtag_click) as well is the no judgment experience, discreet packaging, and the trustworthy reputation they're building when dealing with HIPPA. [$AMZN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&src=cashtag_click)'s threat is convenience, price, deep pockets, and efficiency. However, when it comes to health, I think people will want the personalized service. It is not the same as ordering dog food and toilet paper online. One downside I've seen as well is that Amazon is basing part of their clinic business on collecting your data. I believe there will be a decent percentage of people who will not trust ""big evil"" Amazon with their personal health data. It is difficult to do a really good competitive analysis because some of this is still speculation since [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&src=cashtag_click) and [$amzn](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24amzn&src=cashtag_click) are so new in the space. A lot of segments are yet to be penetrated, and neither are able to accept insurance yet. I believe these 2 will end up taking most of the space while [$tdoc](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24tdoc&src=cashtag_click) gets left behind. ";"28";"2023-10-11T01:17:54"

Amazon will be doing ~$550B in revenue in 2023 alone with low teen growth next year. And their market cap is between $1T-$1.1T.

(Excluding redditors) i am talking about institutional investors, because at these level, they are the one moving the needle. And they clearly loading this up big time.

This is professional financial advice. Kidding ! I'd just like to hear your thoughts and opinions on the stock.  Why I'm Bullish on HIMS:  1) The company is well-positioned for growth in the healthcare industry. HIMS operates a telehealth platform that connects consumers to healthcare professionals. It offers a range of health and wellness products and services on its mobile app.      The reason it’s going to be huge is because it provides prescription medication on a recurring basis and ongoing care from healthcare providers. It’s the Amazon of healthcare. Most (70-80%) of doctor visits can be treated with prescription medication. HIMS allows clients to see doctors much faster and delivers their prescription to their homes. It’s cheaper, faster and more convenient than the traditional healthcare system. HIMS is going to disrupt pharmacies the same way Netflix disrupted Blockbuster.       2) Strong product: HIMS boasts an impressive revenue growth of 52.6%, which proves their product is in high demand … and the demand keeps growing.      3) Excellent balance sheet. No debt. Assets exceed liabilities.       4) Currently undervalued : Considering HIMS solid performance, it remains undervalued compared to its peers. Simply Wall Street’s DCF Model has them 70% undervalued. This could be an excellent buying opportunity for investors looking to get in early on a potential breakout.     Risks to consider :      1) Competition. HIMS has no direct competitor. No one offers eConsultation and ePharmacy combined. Teledoc would be the closest thing to a direct competitor. That being said, Amazon is interested in delivering prescribed medication. Huge companies have a harder time with rapid innovation and competing is easier said than done, but one has to respect a player like Amazon.       2) Share dilution (HIMS is currently unprofitable)     What are your thoughts on HIMS ?

Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month, according to a regulatory disclosure Thursday.      The transactions on the filing, marked with ""SP"" for the spouse, indicate that Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options purchased on May 24, 2022, with a listed expiration date of June 16.      The Apple options had a strike price of $80, and the Microsoft options had a strike price of $180. On Friday, those shares closed at $186.68 and $335.02, respectively, totaling about $933,000 and $1.7 million.      Since the options were purchased last May, Apple shares have gained 33%, and Microsoft has climbed 29%. The upside from the strike price is even higher, at 131% and 83%, respectively.      First highlighted by Quiver Quantitative and Unusual Whales, the disclosure comes after Congress failed to make progress on new legislation around lawmakers and their relatives trading stocks.      Earlier this year, Insider and several other news organizations identified 78 members of Congress who didn't properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act.      Congress passed the law a decade ago to combat insider trading and conflicts of interest. But many lawmakers have not fully complied with reporting requirements, leading to calls for a complete ban on trading individual stocks among members of Congress.      Legislation on such a ban advanced last year, but the bill ultimately died.      Meanwhile, Paul Pelosi has faced backlash over stock trades that seem to coincide with legislation in the technology sector.      For example, in July 2021, he pocketed a $4.8 million gain in a Alphabet stock trade the week before the House Judiciary Committee advanced bipartisan antitrust bills targeting Google, Apple, and Amazon.      However, Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly that her financier husband's trades have nothing to do with her political knowledge.      OpenSecrets estimated that Pelosi has a net worth of $114.6 million.";"2435";"2023-06-27T11:34:17"

"Not all ""tech"" companies deserve to have tech valuations";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13tm27w/not_all_tech_companies_deserve_to_have_tech/";"I often hear a lot about how this & that company are the next Amazon so the PE ratio does not apply to them.  There's a simple question that can tell you whether a company can have tech PEs: do they have unique products that enable them to grow their profit exponentially while keeping their costs linear? If the answer is no, they are just waiting for a correction. Even Amazon's valuation is mostly due to AWS & not their retail side.   For example:  Uber should not have a tech valuation: they are a modern cab company that needs to hire drivers and deal with local presence & its costs grow at the same rate as its revenue. That's why they are not profitable & likely never will be.  TSLA is another one, we can all see now that they want to scale, their margins are shrinking & getting closer to all other car manufacturers.  NVDA is even more prevalent: datacentres don't need an infinite number of GPUs to use pre-trained models to run generative AI applications. They currently have a demand surge & after one or two quarters, the demand will go down just like the crypto craze. The $1 trillion projection Jensen did was pure nonsense. No semi company should have software tech PEs as they cannot grow exponentially while keeping their costs linear. Especially a company like NVDA which is at the mercy of TSM, ASML & others to produce anything.   Edit: No, I don't have exposure to NVDA but the subreddit is full of FOMO posts in last 3 days.  Edit 2: Not financial advice or anything close to it. Just random thoughts.";"86";"2023-05-28T01:56:59"
"FTC sues to block Kroger, Albertsons merger over price and wage concerns";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b0n2q0/ftc_sues_to_block_kroger_albertsons_merger_over/";"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said Monday that it is suing to block the merger of Kroger and Albertsons, saying the combination of the two major grocers would result in higher prices for shoppers and lower wages for workers.  In a release, the FTC said it issued an administrative complaint and authorized a lawsuit in federal court to stop Kroger’s $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons, which would create one of the largest grocers in the country. A bipartisan group of nine attorneys general have joined the court complaint, including those from Arizona, California, Washington D.C., Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming.  “Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons would lead to additional grocery price hikes for everyday goods, further exacerbating the financial strain consumers across the country face today,” said Henry Liu, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. “Essential grocery store workers would also suffer under this deal, facing the threat of their wages dwindling, benefits diminishing, and their working conditions deteriorating.”  Kroger said in a statement that blocking the deal “will actually harm the very people the FTC purports to serve: America’s consumers and workers.”   “The FTC’s decision makes it more likely that America’s consumers will see higher food prices and fewer grocery stores at a time when communities across the country are already facing high inflation and food deserts,” the company said in a statement.  It added that the decision “strengthens larger, non-unionized retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon by allowing them to further increase their overwhelming and growing dominance of the grocery industry.”  Kroger and Albertsons’ agreement has been stuck in a holding pattern for more than a year while federal and state regulators scrutinize the merger. The companies announced the proposed deal in October 2022, and said by teaming up, the grocers would be able to better compete with larger retailers like Walmart, Amazon and Costco.  The FTC argued the supermarket merger would harm shoppers and workers at a time when the price of food and many everyday items has risen. The Biden administration has been skeptical of a range of mergers, and the White House has made consumer protection a key issue as President Joe Biden campaigns for reelection this fall.  Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen has made the company’s case for the tie-up, saying as a larger supermarket operator, the combined companies would be able to lower prices, boost profitability and speed up innovation in the grocery industry. The company also pledged $500 million to reduce prices for customers and $1 billion to raise employee wages and expand benefits.  Yet the deal has faced stiff resistance and new complications after a period of historic inflation. Two unions that represent Kroger and Albertsons employees, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and the Teamsters union, opposed the deal.  Higher prices of everyday food items fueled worries that a bigger company would have too much pricing power — concerns some politicians have echoed.  Higher grocery prices have irked consumers and become a hot topic on the campaign trail. Earlier this month, grocery chains drew the ire of Biden, who accused companies of ripping off shoppers while keeping profit margins high.  Together, Kroger and Albertsons would be a mammoth company and tighten a market share gap with Walmart, the largest grocer in the U.S. Kroger and Albertsons also compete with regional players like Publix and Wegmans, and discounters like Aldi and Trader Joe’s.  Combined, the grocers would have about 5,000 stores across the U.S. The deal would marry Kroger’s approximately two dozen supermarket banners, including its namesake stores, Fred Meyer, and Ralphs with Albertsons’ grocery chains, including Safeway, Acme and Tom Thumb.  In an effort to overcome antitrust concerns, Kroger announced last year that it planned to sell more than 400 stores to Piggly Wiggly owner C&S Wholesale Grocers, along with other assets like distribution centers and some private brands.  But the FTC complaint said that the proposed divestiture isn’t enough. It would create “a hodgepodge of unconnected stores, banners, brands and other assets” that wouldn’t be a true rival to the combined Kroger and Albertsons, the federal agency said in a release Monday.  The FTC contended the combined Kroger and Albertsons would have less reason to improve the customer experience. The federal agency said competition between the supermarkets has contributed to fresher produce, better private label offerings and services that shoppers appreciate, such as flexible pharmacy hours and curbside pickup.  The FTC also argued the deal would leave workers with less negotiating power, since employees wouldn’t have as many potential grocery employers. In some markets like Denver, the combined supermarket operator would be the only employer of unionized grocery workers, the agency said.  As some news outlets reported last week that the FTC would soon sue to block the merger, a Kroger spokeswoman said the company was still in discussions with FTC and state regulators.  The company reiterated its argument that the merger would benefit grocery shoppers and workers.  “Blocking the combination will only embolden large, non-unionized retailers – like Walmart, Amazon and Costco – to continue opposing unions and leaving communities,” the company said in a statement last week. “Kroger will continue to lower prices, grow good-paying union jobs and increase access to fresh food for the families who need it most.”  Kroger shares were trading about 1% lower Monday afternoon, while Albertsons stock was slightly higher.

"Nvidia announces Blackwell AI chips that will launch later this year";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bi129l/nvidia_announces_blackwell_ai_chips_that_will/";"Nvidia on Monday announced a new generation of artificial intelligence chips and software for running AI models. The announcement, made during Nvidia’s developer’s conference in San Jose, comes as the chipmaker seeks to solidify its position as the go-to supplier for AI companies.  Nvidia’s share price is up five-fold and total sales have more than tripled since OpenAI’s ChatGPT kicked off the AI boom in late 2022. Nvidia’s high-end server GPUs are essential for training and deploying large AI models. Companies like Microsoft and Meta have spent billions of dollars buying the chips.  The new generation of AI graphics processors is named Blackwell. The first Blackwell chip is called the GB200 and will ship later this year. Nvidia is enticing its customers with more powerful chips to spur new orders. Companies and software makers, for example, are still scrambling to get their hands on the current generation of H100s and similar chips.  “Hopper is fantastic, but we need bigger GPUs,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Monday at the company’s developer conference in San Jose, California. “Let me introduce you to a very big GPU.”  The company also introduced revenue-generating software called NIM that will make it easier to deploy AI, giving customers another reason to stick with Nvidia chips over a rising field of competitors.  Nvidia executives say that the company is becoming less of a mercenary chip provider and more of a platform provider, like Microsoft or Apple, on which other companies can build software.  “The sellable commercial product was the GPU and the software was all to help people use the GPU in different ways,” said Nvidia enterprise VP Manuvir Das in an interview. “Of course, we still do that. But what’s really changed is, we really have a commercial software business now.”  Das said Nvidia’s new software will make it easier to run programs on any of Nvidia’s GPUs, even older ones that might be better suited for deploying but not building AI.  “If you’re a developer, you’ve got an interesting model you want people to adopt, if you put it in a NIM, we’ll make sure that it’s runnable on all our GPUs, so you reach a lot of people,” Das said.  Every two years Nvidia updates its GPU architecture, unlocking a big jump in performance. Many of the AI models released over the past year were trained on the company’s Hopper architecture — used by chips such as the H100 — which was announced in 2022.  Nvidia says Blackwell-based processors, like the GB200, offer a huge performance upgrade for AI companies, with 20 petaflops in AI performance versus 4 petaflops for the H100. The additional processing power will enable AI companies to train bigger and more intricate models, Nvidia said.  The chip includes what Nvidia calls a “transformer engine specifically built to run transformers-based AI, one of the core technologies underpinning ChatGPT.  The Blackwell GPU is large and combines two separately manufactured dies into one chip manufactured by TSMC. It will also be available as an entire server called the GB200 NVLink 2, combining 72 Blackwell GPUs and other Nvidia parts designed to train AI models.  Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle will sell access to the GB200 through cloud services. The GB200 pairs two B200 Blackwell GPUs with one Arm-based Grace CPU. Nvidia said Amazon Web Services would build a server cluster with 20,000 GB200 chips.  Nvidia said that the system can deploy a 27-trillion-parameter model. That’s much larger than even the biggest models, such as GPT-4, which reportedly has 1.7 trillion parameters. Many artificial intelligence researchers believe bigger models with more parameters and data could unlock new capabilities.  Nvidia didn’t provide a cost for the new GB200 or the systems it’s used in. Nvidia’s Hopper-based H100 costs between $25,000 and $40,000 per chip, with whole systems that cost as much as $200,000, according to analyst estimates.  Nvidia also announced it’s adding a new product named NIM to its Nvidia enterprise software subscription.  NIM makes it easier to use older Nvidia GPUs for inference, or the process of running AI software, and will allow companies to continue to use the hundreds of millions of Nvidia GPUs they already own. Inference requires less computational power than the initial training of a new AI model. NIM enables companies that want to run their own AI models, instead of buying access to AI results as a service from companies like OpenAI.  The strategy is to get customers who buy Nvidia-based servers to sign up for Nvidia enterprise, which costs $4,500 per GPU per year for a license.  Nvidia will work with AI companies like Microsoft or Hugging Face to ensure their AI models are tuned to run on all compatible Nvidia chips. Then, using a NIM, developers can efficiently run the model on their own servers or cloud-based Nvidia servers without a lengthy configuration process.  “In my code, where I was calling into OpenAI, I will replace one line of code to point it to this NIM that I got from Nvidia instead,” Das said.  Nvidia says the software will also help AI run on GPU-equipped laptops, instead of on servers in the cloud.

Right when coronavirus was getting 'better' I exited all my positions and invested my money pretty much in 3 companies, Amazon, Microsoft and Alibaba. (33% each)  around 60k in alibaba, at 185€  Theoretically a good stock, e-commerce in china is not bad, alibaba-cloud is a good thing, massive company, numbers looked good. I'd still say that it's a good stock, if only there was no CCP.  So, it's been going down for the last few years, we're currently at ~66€, it was already this low like 1-2 years ago, recovered, now down again. 66% down for me.  I'm not rich at all, where others bought a department or something I have my money in stocks, and a third of it is about to be wiped out possibly. Honestly I don't think alibaba is going anywhere but who knows what the CCP will do and if/when it will recover, to 120€ / 180€, who knows.  Meanwhile the spy and all other stocks im interested in are at their alltime-high, i'm not about to sell with 66% loss, invest in something else, only for the market to go down because thats's how it goes.  For the last 3 years I thought ""let's wait and see"", and, well, I'm not exactly thrilled. Yeah it's trading at 7 PE, if we get positive indicators it could go back to 120€ I guess, already did that 1 year ago.  Any opinion on this situation? Feeling pretty bad about this.

Here are two screening rules.  - must be listed in US (nasdaq or nyse) - must be an index stock with a market cap above 20B  Major factors for me are - interest rate cuts  - gen ai  - value vs market.   My top 5 picks for the new year: - Amazon. Overall a great company, but with the whole AI race and AWS providing it as a service, I think there will be some good tail winds for this stock in the new year.   Google: the latest AI show and tell from Google was mind blowing. They have a chatgpt killer. I think Google is back as the leader in ai based search.  Palo Alto Networks: cyber security is still going to be big in the next year and Palo Alto is comparative priced better when compared to Crowdstrike and others and they have products that align better for SMBs. So I feel they would have a good upside in comparison to competition.   Adobe:  I think this is another gen ai play. I feel with the whole digital media space has been really disrupted with gen ai. I would have loved to see the whole Figma purchase go through but nonetheless I think there is a lot going on here and I will see a lot of general users coming onboard adobe  now as the learning curve has just got flatter.   PayPal: this stock has done soo bad and fallen soo much that it’s just dead cheap in comparison to the sp500. With new leadership I feel things are going to see some improvement in the coming year.

A rebound in the stock market and the recovering economy were no doubt contributors, but the biggest gains have come over the past few weeks in the wake of a few historic announcements. Several big-name automakers have ceded the high ground, joining the Tesla Supercharger network and adopting its North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector, which is now on the road to becoming the industry standard on the continent.   This stampede of partnerships prompts the question: Is Tesla having an ""AWS moment""?  # The agreements driving Tesla stock higher  Late last month, Ford announced that beginning early next year, Ford electric vehicle (EV) owners would gain access to more than 12,000 Tesla charging stations across the U.S. Ford's chief customer officer, Marin Gjaja, cited Tesla's ""large, reliable and efficient charging system"" as the incentive.      Just weeks later, General Motors announced that it, too, would join the Tesla Supercharger network. On Tuesday, Rivian jumped on the bandwagon, joining the company's North American network, while Hyundai is considering a similar move.   In each case, the automakers have noted that after initially requiring an adapter, they would equip future EVs with an NACS charge port within the next couple of years, eliminating the need for adapters going forward.  # The cloud connection  Back in 2000, Amazon (AMZN) was hamstrung by a number of growth-related issues, the biggest being the ability to scale its nascent operations. To address this challenge, the company developed a cloud infrastructure system that would form the foundation for its growing e-commerce business.      At the time -- and unbeknownst to Amazon executives -- the company had planted the seeds that would eventually become Amazon Web Services (AWS), its lucrative cloud computing service. After being used solely by Amazon employees for several years, the service debuted to the public in early 2006, and the company began renting out the cloud infrastructure it originally developed for in-house use. And the rest -- as they say -- is history.       AWS quickly become one of Amazon's most lucrative enterprises, a paradigm that continues to this day. In 2022, AWS generated revenue of more than $80 billion, up 29% year over year. More importantly, the cloud computing business was responsible for just 15% of Amazon's total revenue but all of its operating income -- even subsidizing the losses from its e-commerce operations.   The company is still the leader in the cloud business it pioneered, closing out the first quarter with a 32% share of the cloud infrastructure market, which is as much as the shares of Microsoft and Alphabet combined, according to data supplied by research firm Canalys.       The parallel here is clear. Tesla originally developed the Supercharger network solely for use by its customers, but it appears to be transforming into a lucrative industry standard.  # AWS moment?  The ability to take a substantial business costs and turn them into a hefty revenue generator is a rare thing, which is why some are calling this Tesla's ""AWS moment."" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is one such commentator. He notes that while the company is known for accelerating EV adoption around the globe, Tesla's Supercharger network is the hidden gem that will take the company -- and its stock -- to the next level:       I believe ""what has changed"" for the Street over the last month is the recognition with the Ford and GM supercharger partnerships that Tesla's sum-of-the-parts valuation is now finally starting to get tapped into. This reminds us of when the Street started to realize the margin story and valuation at AWS for Amazon.      He goes on to estimate that the pacts with Ford and GM could add another $3 billion to Tesla's EV charging revenue ""over the next few years.""      Piper Sandler agrees and is more precise in its estimates, estimating that charging from non-Tesla customers could add $3 billion to revenue by 2030, surging to $5.4 billion by 2032. A greater number of EVs on the road -- from numerous automakers -- will no doubt accelerate this ""flywheel effect,"" enriching Tesla and its shareholders along the way.       The company is also vying for roughly $7.5 million in subsidies offered by the Biden administration to expand its Supercharger network if other automakers have access to its system. In all, this amounts to nearly $13 billion in additional financial incentives for Tesla to open up its network.       It's also worth noting that Tesla also has a significant advantage over its rivals with one of the most cost-effective chargers in the business. The company has been able to construct charging stations for as little as $42,000 per connector, compared to a range of $100,000 to $250,000 for its rivals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tesla can use the additional funds from non-Tesla customers to expand its Supercharger network, further fueling the flywheel.       While it's still early days for these charging collaborations, this could eventually be a big revenue generator for Tesla.  # The fine print  As previously noted, Tesla's stock price has soared this year -- up nearly 50% in the past month alone -- as a result of the recent announcements, with a commensurate increase in its valuation. The stock currently has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 77 and sells for over eight times forward sales -- a lofty valuation by any measure. For context, analysts expect the company to grow revenue by 22% and 29%, respectively, in 2023 and 2024. Value investors will no doubt balk at the stock's hefty price tag.      That said, Tesla is the undisputed leader in the U.S. EV market and is just beginning to flex its charging station muscles. If the company eventually adopts a similar strategy for batteries and energy storage solutions, Tesla's recent gains could be just the beginning for those with a long-term outlook.

"Coupang(CPNG). Any thoughts on this company?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17ubjog/coupangcpng_any_thoughts_on_this_company/";"Coupang is a South Korean e-commerce company founded in 2010. The company has quickly become the country's largest online retailer, surpassing Amazon Korea in 2018. Coupang is known for its innovative technologies, such as its own delivery network and its artificial intelligence-powered shopping platform. The company has also been expanding rapidly into new areas, such as food delivery and financial services.  **Key Drivers of Coupang's Growth:**  \-Rocket Delivery: Coupang's signature Rocket Delivery service promises delivery of orders within 24 hours, and in some cases, within hours. This has been a major factor in the company's success, as it provides a level of convenience and speed that is unmatched by traditional retailers.  This is all possible thanks to Coupang's extensive footprint of over 100 fulfillment centers across the entirety of South Korea. Given the country is fairly small, 70% of the population lives within just 7 miles of a logistics center.  Similar to Amazon, Coupang uses machine learning and artificial intelligence in order to specify which products should be stocked in which fulfillment center based on expected demand.  Coupang also offers a service called Rocket Fresh, which is similar to Amazon Fresh, offering delivery of fresh groceries. However, unlike Amazon, the company has launched a food delivery service called Eats, which was widely popular during the lockdown of 2020.  \-Data-Driven Approach: Coupang uses artificial intelligence and data analytics to personalize the shopping experience for its customers. This includes recommending products based on past purchases and browsing history, as well as offering personalized discounts and promotions.  \-Expansion into New Businesses: Coupang has been expanding rapidly into new businesses, such as food delivery and financial services. This is helping the company to diversify its revenue streams and reach new customers.  **Financial highlights:**  &#x200B:  * Coupang's revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 42% since 2018. * 63 P/E * 26 Forward P/E * 13.5 P/OCF * They've just become profitable in 2023, almost doubling their gross margin from 2021.  **Global Expansion:**  Coupang plans to use Taiwan as a starting point to replicate its same-day delivery success in South Korea and expand this strategy to Southeast Asia.  Coupang's next-day delivery service, Rocket Delivery, has grown faster in Taiwan in the 10 months since its launch than Rocket Delivery in Korea in the first 10 months. The company has allocated around $400 million for investment in Taiwan this year.  Replicating this business model will be harder in other countries, especially those where Amazon has a strong presence. However, the company is launching in Singapore, which only has a population of 5.7 million people and thus should be easier to penetrate.  Japan is also a key battleground as the business rolls out trial operations in the country. Tokyo specifically is a key area of focus as the population is just 14 million people and has a similar culture to South Korea. Amazon Japan is the current leader in the country, but other players such as Rakuten and Yahoo Japan hold fragmented market share positions.  Another country of focus is Malaysia. Although its population is not as wealthy as the other countries mentioned, its capital, Kuala Lumpur, has a population of 8.2 million people.  &#x200B:  &#x200B:  &#x200B:";"6";"2023-11-13T15:15:03"

"Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven' (apple, meta, google, Microsoft, Tesla..)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14w58g3/nasdaq_100_plans_special_rebalance_to_curb/";"From https://www.investors.com/news/nasdaq-100-plans-special-rebalance-to-curb-dominance-of-magnificent-seven/    The Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the ""magnificent seven"" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.  The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.  The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to ""address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights.""  The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.  The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.   How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted? The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.  The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.  The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.  Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.  Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.  Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.  Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.  Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.  How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut? Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.  Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.  The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.  Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023 The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.  This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.  There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.  Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices? The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.  However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&P 500, which is why S&P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.  The S&P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.  Most of the ""magnificent 7"" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.  The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.  Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.";"105";"2023-07-10T22:25:37"
"Tim Cook teases Apple AI announcement ‘later this year’";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1agtkhe/tim_cook_teases_apple_ai_announcement_later_this/";"Apple CEO Tim Cook teased that Apple may have an artificial intelligence announcement later this year during a call with analysts after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings.  While Cook’s remarks on Thursday did not include many details, they did indicate that Apple wants to compete with Microsoft, Google, Amazon, OpenAI and other technology companies working on cutting-edge AI models that can generate text and images.  “As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future,” Cook said during a call with analysts. “That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we’re excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.”  Generative AI started drawing significant attention from technology companies and investors starting in 2022, after OpenAI released ChatGPT and image generators rapidly improved. Apple did not announce an advanced AI model last year, although the company has long invested in similar machine learning technology in its chips and software, which can, for example, identify people or pets inside photographs.  Apple typically announces new software in June at its annual developer’s conference, WWDC. Last year, the company announced an autocorrect feature for the iPhone keyboard based on a transformer-based language model, which shares the same underlying technology as GPT. But Apple never used the phrase “artificial intelligence” during the presentation, preferring the more academic term “machine learning.”  “Let me just say that I think there’s a huge opportunity for Apple with Gen AI and AI, without getting into more details and getting out in front of myself,” Cook said.

"Reddit's IPO - The most important details & red flags";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b24tan/reddits_ipo_the_most_important_details_red_flags/";"It has been a while since there was an exciting IPO, but finally, there is one.   I went through the Reddit prospectus, and here's my summary of Reddit as a company, the IPO, and some of the red flags I saw.  &#x200B:  The post will be divided into the following segments:  **- Current business model**  \- **Future business model**  \- **Analysis of financial statements**  \- **Why IPO?**  **- The IPO strategy**  **- Sam Altman**  **- Valuation**  &#x200B:  **Current business model**  Reddit's primary revenue source is - advertising. In 2023, it accounted for 98% of the $804 million in revenue. The remaining 2% comes from Reddit premium subscriptions, as well as products within the user economy (Reddit Gold / Avatars).  Given the significance of the advertising revenue stream, let's focus on that. The simple formula that can be derived is: **Number of users** multiplied by **Average revenue per user**.   These are the two most important numbers that any investor needs to focus on when analyzing almost any advertising business.  Let's start with the number of users. In an ideal world, we should know the exact number of users, and divide that with the potential user size. This will allow us to calculate the so-called ""penetration rate"". So, if the penetration rate is 10% for example, it indicates that the company has plenty of room to grow.  Reddit discloses two metrics: DAUq (Daily active uniques) and WAUq (Weekly active uniques). This could be seen as the first red flag. Here's why:  If we define the market size as users who are above the age of 14, that's over 270 million in the U.S.  The U.S. daily active uniques are 36 million. Hence, if we use these metrics, the penetration rate is about **13%**.  However, if we use the weekly active uniques, we get to a penetration rate of almost **50%** (131 million WAUq).  So, which one is it?  I'll argue that even the 50% is understated. Why? Because first of all, not everyone will be on Reddit, just as not everyone will be on any other platform. Second of all, there are users who use Reddit once every few months, when they need someone's advice or opinion. These, once in a while users are not taken into these metrics.  In theory, the company can innovate, and bring new features, that attract more users, and the average time spent per user increases. Given that the platform doesn't change too much over time, I'll argue that the platform applies only to a certain type of user and is getting close to the ceiling when it comes to growing within the U.S.  Internationally, on the other side, there is plenty of room to grow. However, as George Orwell said, ""All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others"".  This brings us to the 2nd part of the equation - average revenue per user.  The average U.S. user brings 4x more revenue than the average user from the rest of the world. So, although there is room to grow, it is less valuable.  &#x200B:  **Future business model**  This is a good short summary of Reddit's main income stream, but it is backward-looking, and there is one more thing that we need to take into account. Its data.  It is fair to say that the platform is one of the internet's largest archives of human experiences and conversations, and this data definitely has value. It can be used for various reasons, including, training large language models. Pretty much the same day as filing the prospectus, Reddit and Google announced a partnership, that is expected to be worth $60 million per year. This is 8% of its 2023 revenue and I believe this revenue stream - licensing data - is what will create all the hype around the company.   Here's why I think that:  &#x200B:  **Analysis of financial statements**  Despite being around for 19 years, Reddit is still struggling to find its way to profitability and loses around $100m per year. It can be argued that the company is poorly managed, and it reminds me of Twitter prior to the acquisition of Elon Musk, when the R&D was incredibly high and couldn't be justified with the new features introduced by the platform.  Reddit's R&D for 2023 was $438 million (55% of revenue). Of course, this is lagging, as in many cases, the value created from it is somewhere in the future. However, this isn't something new. Reddit has historically had high R&D expenses. Whether this is justified or not, of course, you be the judge.  Its revenue growth in 2023 was 20%, which isn't too exciting and can be barely labeled as a growth company. Especially considering there's not much room to grow in the U.S. and its international growth is less valuable.  &#x200B:  The expectation is that the valuation will be above $5 billion. The company has over $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities and no debt apart from leases. Meaning, that the valuation of the business is above $3.8 billion.   I'd argue with the current business model and lack of profitability, this cannot be justified. Its future value is highly dependent on the success of data licensing, a revenue stream, that we have very little information on.  &#x200B:  **Why IPO?**  However, the question ""Why IPO?"" has not been answered yet. The company is losing $100m per year and has over $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. This is sufficient to cover the losses for the foreseeable future. So, raising additional funds doesn't seem to be the main reason for the IPO.  Two reasons should be considered:  1. **Liquidity for the existing shareholders** \-  However, if the existing shareholders are pushing for this, it means they're not too optimistic about the company's future. 2. Executive compensation - The CEO, for example, has over 660k PRSUs (Performance-restricted share units) that are eligible to vest when the company attains a $5b market cap valuation.  In my opinion, if the current shareholders believe in the company, they would be better off if the company remained private. So far, I am not convinced that the IPO adds any value to the company.  Being a public company brings quite some costs. The list of all costs, that is disclosed in the prospectus is yet to be completed, and there are also going to be additional ongoing expenses for being a public company, that will be incurred every single year.  &#x200B:  **The IPO strategy**  The price of pretty much anything is a function of supply and demand. As Reddit doesn't need additional funds, I don't expect the company will issue too many additional shares. Rumors range from raising $100m to $750m. Now, if we focus on the demand, here's another red flag.  Qualified Reddit users and moderators will be invited to buy shares in the IPO, alongside other investors, through a directed share program. In my opinion, this is a psychological trick, making the users and moderators feel special so that they use this special offer to buy shares.  In addition, there will be shares offered through Fidelity Brokerage Services, SoFi, and Robinhood. So, if someone wants to buy into an IPO, they get a chance to do that. Basically, the goal is to increase demand as much as possible.  &#x200B:  **Sam Altman**  Entities affiliated with Sam Altman have 9.2% voting power. Yes, the  OpenAI Sam Altman.  Have you seen the licensing deal between OpenAI and Reddit?   Me neither.  &#x200B:  **Valuation**  Anyway, one of the questions that many have is - Is Reddit going to be overvalued from the start? The answer to that question depends on your expectations for the data licensing model. Based on my estimates, the current advertising business model is worth around $1.7 billion.  Add the $1.2 billion of cash on top of it, and the valuation is close to $3 billion.  Of course, I could be wrong in my estimates, but it is quite clear that the advertising business doesn't explain the $5 billion + valuation.  So, is the data licensing revenue stream worth more than $2 billion? This is one of the main questions that needs to be answered. As there is no past information, it is also the key piece of the puzzle to create hype around the company. I would not be surprised if more data licensing information followed before the IPO, which further increases the hype around the company.  However, if Reddit can land many data licensing deals, then the $5 billion valuation can be justified.  &#x200B:  I'd love to read your thoughts about the IPO, your thoughts on how much the data licensing stream is worth, as well as if there is something else that you find important, that I missed.";"251";"2024-02-28T13:23:13"
"Big Tech (Google and Meta) begins to give out dividend";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cgy1w4/big_tech_google_and_meta_begins_to_give_out/";"Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia been giving out dividends for a long time despite being a huge tech firm.   As of recently, Google and Meta decide to begin giving out dividends to its shareholders. Is this seen as bullish?   We hold big tech firms due to huge earning growth potential and they tend to distribute their earnings into innovation and R&D, which will with no doubt boost their future earning if done right.   Now that Google and Meta begin to give out dividend, it seems appealing for mutual fund managers to add more into their portfolios, which will boost their stock prices further. But this will probably hurt their future earning potential in long term as they will have less allocated to R&D. What do y'all think?   This will also give pressure to Amazon to consider offering dividend to their shareholders. Tesla? I don't think so. ";"99";"2024-04-30T19:10:00"

I'm not saying they aren't fast. But when I go in there they very frequently are out of a flavor, a product, an ingredient, or some miscellaneous tool like a carton carrier or drink lid. The flavors they have available in stock or even on the menu at all are never reflected on the menu on the wall above the counter. When I talk to the staff about it (who are nice) they say it's been ordered and everything but they kind of get left in the lurch by the company. They told me sometimes they and many other locations order things from amazon. The drinks don't taste as good as other coffee chains or local coffee shops to myself and many people i know even though it's by far the most successful chain that definitely has the means to make better tasting drinks. It feels the whole year revolves around pumpkin spice in the fall and winter. Why must it be like this? They should have drinks every season people can get excited about. The pumpkin isn't the only good tasting seasonal flavor. Idk, I feel if they actually focused on organization and product there would be so much room for the stock to go up because of their sheer scale, but I know there is no real demand for this kind of change. Anybody else feel like this? What are your thoughts?  Edit: I also feel they can really benefit from a real lunch menu. They have almost nothing to eat for lunch for any kind of coffee shop. It's like pitiful. Imagine how many more people they'd draw in if that actually had a real sandwich someone can buy.

"Reddit shares soar 14% after company reports revenue pop in first earnings report";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cmmlqj/reddit_shares_soar_14_after_company_reports/";"Reddit shares rallied 14% in extended trading on Tuesday after the company released quarterly results for the first time since its IPO in March.  Here’s how the company did:  Loss per share: $8.19 loss per share. That may not compare with the $8.71 loss expected by LSEG  Revenue: $243 million vs. $212.8 million expected by LSEG  Revenue climbed 48% from $163.7 million a year earlier. The company reported $222.7 million in ad revenue for the period, up 39% year over year, which is a faster rate of growth than at its top competitors.  Digital advertising companies have started growing again at a healthy clip after brands reeled in spending to cope with inflation in 2022. Meta’s ad revenue jumped 27% in the first quarter, followed by 24% growth at Amazon and 13% growth at Google parent Alphabet.  Reddit reported a net loss of $575.1 million. Stock-based compensation expenses and related taxes were $595.5 million, primarily driven by IPO charges.  For the second quarter, Reddit expects revenue of $240 million to $255 million, topping the $224 million expected by analysts, according to LSEG. The midpoint of the guidance range suggests growth of about 32% for the second quarter, up from $183 million from a year earlier.  Reddit, which hosts millions of online forums on its platform, was founded in 2005 by Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, the company’s CEO.   “We see this as the beginning of a new chapter as we work towards building the next generation of Reddit,” Huffman said in a release Tuesday.  Reddit began trading under the ticker symbol “RDDT” on the New York Stock Exchange in March. The company priced its IPO at $34 per share, which valued the company around $6.5 billion. When tech valuations were red hot in 2021, Reddit’s private market valuation reached $10 billion.  The stock climbed past $58 in after-hours trading on Tuesday before coming back a bit. Should the stock close above $57.75 on Wednesday, it would be at its highest since March 26, its fourth day of trading. The shares closed that day at $65.11, their highest yet.  The company reported 82.7 million daily active users for its first quarter, up from the 76.6 million expected by StreetAccount.

By looking at the company I havent seen many problems either. Revenues are growing, and so are EPS, the debt is decreasing and the margins are quite stable. Operating income has risen a lot and the number of outstanding share has been going down. It really doesn't look bad compared to other companies in the same sector.  The biggest treat I can see is the competition from Whole Food and Amazon Fresh, but their stores aren't necesserely in the same cities, and taking over a grocery gigant like Kroger (2700 stores if I am not wrong) would be a very big task, requiring huge investments and crazy capex.

This nearly negated the 9.2% surge the company experienced on Wednesday, propelled by a robust quarterly vehicle delivery report. The bond sale decision was not well-received by investors since convertible bonds can dilute share value upon conversion. These bonds are scheduled to mature in October 2030, offering investors an option to convert them into either cash or company shares. In contrast to the bond sale setback, Rivian has showcased impressive performance in recent months. Its Q2 and Q3 2023 vehicle delivery numbers exceeded Wall Street predictions, with the company affirming its aim to produce 52,000 vehicles by the end of 2023.

I bought Amazon because I think they're future looks bright and didn't see it performing worse than the 2040 fund and then I basically just kept buying stocks related to AI.

"Netflix is up 137% in the last year. Is this a breakout or a fakeout?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14jevod/netflix_is_up_137_in_the_last_year_is_this_a/";"# Shares of the streaming stock are on fire. Will the boom last?  The stock market has been full of surprises this year, including the emergence of artificial intelligence as a key narrative, the resilience of the U.S. economy, and the boom in big tech stocks.      Among the most unexpected winners, this year is Netflix (NFLX 0.36%), the leading streamer, whose shares dove most of last year as growth slowed and it faced a new wave of competition from legacy media companies.      After losing more than two-thirds of its value over a six-month span in 2021 and 2022, Netflix has managed to flip the narrative -- the streaming stock is now up 44% year to date and 137% over the past year. Those gains have come for two primary reasons: the introduction of password-sharing fees and the launch of its ad-supported subscription tier.       Both of those moves reflect changes the company has made to its longtime strategy. Let's take a look at the implications of each one to see if the stock can sustain its recent gains.    # Paid sharing  Paid sharing is likely the most controversial move Netflix has made in a long time. The streaming service had long turned a blind eye toward password sharing as the company believed that it was a way of promoting its service. Management also seemed to think that password borrowers would subscribe directly to the service when they were ready.  However, Netflix's maturing user base seemed to convince the company to crack down on password sharing. Instead of essentially allowing unlimited sharing, Netflix has sent notices to its members telling them that their account is only for them and the people in their homes. They can pay an additional $7.99 per month to share their account with someone who does not live with them.      Netflix implemented paid sharing in May, and the stock has jumped since the rollout, up nearly 20% since May 23, when it announced the new policy in the U.S. According to media reports, the move drove a spike in new subscriptions, and over the four-day period from May 25 to May 28, its new customer additions were higher than in any period since at least 2019.      Analysts have roundly cheered the move as well, seeing it as essentially 100% incremental profit as there are basically no costs associated with it. Netflix has yet to report earnings since it rolled out paid sharing, but we should get a sense of the impact when Netflix announces second-quarter results next month.  # The new ad tier  While the password-sharing crackdown should give its bottom line a boost, the ad tier rollout is likely to give a longer-term lift to the business as it allows the company to tap into a new revenue stream and supplement payments from subscribers.   Reed Hastings, who recently stepped down as co-CEO of Netflix, recognized this opportunity after long resisting advertising, as he noticed that advertiser demand was following TV audiences from linear TV to streaming outlets.      The vast majority of subscribers are expected to remain in the ad-free tier, but Netflix is using the ad-based tier to attract new subscribers. And it appears to be working. As of May, the company had added nearly 5 million subscribers to the ad-supported tier, just six months after the launch, and more than 25% of new subscribers are choosing the ad tier in markets where it's available.  # Is the comeback for real?  Netflix's stock is still down significantly from its peak in late 2021, which came after the subscription boom early in the pandemic, so the recent resurgence should be viewed in that context.      The streamer now faces significantly more competition than it did just a few years ago, but many of its legacy competitors are focused on cutting costs in order to drive profits at their streaming businesses, which gives Netflix an advantage as it not only has a large audience to monetize its content spending, but it also has proven its profitability.  After the rally, Netflix stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 40 based on this year's estimates, which seems fair given its ability to gain operating leverage as it grows revenue.   While I wouldn't expect another doubling of the stock, it should be able to hold its gains this time around.

"Spotify turns a profit as earnings and revenue beat estimstes";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cb1vuq/spotify_turns_a_profit_as_earnings_and_revenue/";"Spotify Technology (SPOT) reported fiscal first quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The audio giant also swung to a profit as it continues to implement its recent ""efficiency"" strategy.  Over the past year, Spotify has committed to multiple rounds of layoffs in addition to price increases and other initiatives to boost top-line growth and improve margins. The company said it will be more intentional about future investments after spending billions on its push into the crowded podcast market.  The audio giant reported operating income of 168 million euros ($179 million), compared with a loss of 156 million euros in the prior-year period. This was below company guidance of 180 million euros as social charges came in higher than expected, ""driven by share price appreciation during the quarter"", according to Spotify.  It also guided to a strong Q2 operating income of 250 million euros, well ahead of Wall Street consensus expectations. Revenue guidance for the second quarter also came in ahead of estimates — 3.8 billion euros versus the 3.76 billion euros that was expected.  On top of more deliberate spending, Spotify will reportedly once again raise prices after hiking the cost of certain subscription plans last summer.  According to Bloomberg, Spotify plans to raise prices by about $1 to $2 a month in five markets, including the UK, Australia, and Pakistan. The changes are expected to come at the end of April, with US prices to rise ""later this year."" The report also said Spotify plans to introduce a cheaper option that does not include audiobooks.  The stock moved more than 9% higher in pre-market trading on Tuesday following the results.  The streaming service reported net income of 197 million euros ($210 million), or earnings of 0.97 euros per share. That was ahead of analyst expectations of earnings of 0.65 euros per share. It also compares with the year-earlier period loss of 225 million euros, or a loss of 1.16 euros a share.  Gross margins came in stronger than expected at 27.6%, beating company guidance of 26.4%. The streamer said it expects margins to tick up to 28.1% in the second quarter, primarily driven by year-over-year improvements in music and podcasting.  Spotify has previously said it expects the metric to come in between 30% and 35% over the long term amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business.  Revenue, meanwhile, totaled 3.64 billion euros ($3.88 billion) — 20% higher compared with the first quarter of 2023, and above Wall Street expectations of 3.61 billion euros.  User figures  Total monthly active users (MAUs) came in below company estimates of 618 million to hit 615 million in the quarter — but still a 19% improvement compared with the total in the year-ago period. The streaming service anticipates Q2 MAUs to come in at 631 million.  Premium subscribers met Wall Street expectations of 239 million — a 14% year-over-year jump. Spotify expects that subscriber count to increase to 245 million in the second quarter.  Free cash flow, another key metric for investors, came in at 207 million euros in the quarter compared to 57 million euros in the year-ago period.  The average revenue per user, or ARPU, for Premium subscriptions increased 7% to 4.55 euros (or 5% year over year, excluding foreign exchange headwinds.) ARPU was driven by price increase benefits that were partially offset by discounted plans and lower prices in emerging markets, the company said.  Profit pledge  Overall, analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis.  Spotify stock has surged more than 100% over the past year and is up 43% year to date.  Spotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market over the past four years with splashy A-list deals and $400 million-plus studio acquisitions.  That spending took a significant bite out of gross margins and weighed heavily on profitability. In response, Spotify committed to several rounds of layoffs — three in 2023 alone.  Spotify CFO Paul Vogel stepped down from his position on March 31. He will be replaced by Christian Luiga, previously at Swedish aerospace and defense company Saab. Luiga will take over in the third quarter, the company said.  In addition to layoffs and price increases, Spotify also changed up its royalty structure, made audiobooks free to paying subscribers, and locked in new deals with popular podcasters like Joe Rogan and Alexandra Cooper of ""Call Her Daddy.""  The new deals come as Spotify further revamps its podcast strategy to focus more on distribution rather than exclusivity.  The audio giant announced that Rogan's podcast, its most popular on the platform, will be available on additional services like Apple Podcasts (AAPL), Amazon Music (AMZN), and YouTube (GOOGL) for the first time in years. Spotify will handle distribution and ad sales as it works to maximize revenue. Rogan will receive a guaranteed minimum rate and cut of the advertising revenue.

"PSA: Do you beat yourself up after missing 'obvious' opportunities like Nvidia and AI? It's not just you, and it's called Hindsight Bias.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13xwknm/psa_do_you_beat_yourself_up_after_missing_obvious/";"Before I knew about this psychological bias, I (and many others I know) thought we just had trouble 'biting the bullet' and investing in solid ideas. Thoughts like ""it was in front of me all along, but for some reason, I was too scared to put money into it"" were common. But the fact of the matter is, there are thousands of 'ideas' at any given moment, and the ones that actually make the news and become multi-baggers were **not** obvious in the past. So why do people feel this way, that they keep 'missing' out on obviously great investments? This is what is known as Hindsight Bias.   Hindsight bias is, [according to Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hindsight-bias.asp), ""a psychological phenomenon that allows people to convince themselves after an event that they accurately predicted it before it happened. This can lead people to conclude that they can accurately predict other events. Hindsight bias is studied in behavioral economics because it is a common failing of individual investors.""  Why is knowing about hindsight bias significant? One, because if you believe that you **did** have proper insight and analytical skills to spot future success stories, then you might chase after any idea that looks good to to you **now**. However, unless you actually have proof that you were able to consistency find good ideas in that past that you simply didn't capitalize on, then you should not trust just your memory. Otherwise, one would pick potentially bad investments, and then **think** that they knew about other better ideas, repeating the cycle.   It's also important to recognize this bias just for your state of mind. Enough people feel bad enough about missing multi-baggers like Amazon when they should be giving themselves a break. Saying you could have made made 100k if you only invested in some stock years ago is not the same as losing 100k, or we'd all be in the hole. So don't fret about the past and keep looking to the future. There are still plenty of opportunities out there, so best of luck investing!   **Tldr:** Whatever happened in the past was not obvious, no matter how much it feels like it. Don't be overconfident that you can catch future ones but don't beat yourself up over missing opportunities either. Focus on the future!";"921";"2023-06-02T01:17:42"

I understand it would be horrific for TSM if Taiwan was invaded, but as someone under 20 years old, I am more than happy to bet my money on WW3 not happening.  They are miles ahead of other semiconductor producers, and out of the major producers,  they are the only one who is only a foundry. Samsung competes with Apple, therefore they prefer TSM. NVIDIA, AMD etc compete with Intel therefore they will also prefer TSM even if Intel catches up. Not to mention the CEO's of NVIDIA and AMD are also Taiwanese.  What are the other risks to this company? I've researched this quite a bit and it always comes down to ""It's an amazing company, but geopolitics"".

The company’s services, used by the C.I.A. and Western militaries for more than a decade, were deployed to track emergency room capacity and direct supplies of scarce equipment.  > Palantir charged the government just one pound.  > The deal provided the company with a valuable toehold.

"Rivian shares surge as company reveals new EV models, $2.25 billion in cost savings";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b93jvo/rivian_shares_surge_as_company_reveals_new_ev/";"Shares of Rivian Automotive surged roughly 10% Thursday as the EV maker unveiled three new vehicles and announced more than $2 billion in savings related to pausing construction on a plant in Georgia.  Two of those EVs came as a surprise to consumers and investors. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe, in announcing the company’s upcoming R2 SUV, also revealed two additional crossovers called the R3 and R3X, a performance variant.  The R2 is expected to start at about $45,000 when it goes on sale during the first half of 2026. It’s expected to be the fourth product for Rivian following a commercial delivery van and larger, more expensive R1S SUV and R1T pickup for consumers. The R1 vehicles start at roughly $70,000 and can top $100,000.  Scaringe disclosed few details about the surprise R3 crossovers, but told CNBC’s Phil LeBeau that the R3 will be priced lower than the R1.  “These represent our future,” Scaringe said during a livestreamed event from Laguna Beach, California.  The announcements come at a crucial time for Rivian as it attempts to expand its customer base amid slower-than-expected EV sales in the U.S. after automakers flooded the first-adopter market with pricey all-electric vehicles in recent years.  Rivian’s sales pace has slowed in recent quarters, and the company widely disappointed investors last month by missing quarterly estimates and forecasting slightly lower production this year compared to 2023 due to plant downtime.  The Amazon-backed company has been burning through cash to improve current EV production and narrow losses.  Shifting production of the R2 from the in-development plant in Georgia to the company’s plant in Normal, Illinois, will save $2.25 billion, Rivian said in a press release. It will also allow the vehicle to begin production earlier, it said.  The company said it will pause construction on the Georgia plant, to be resumed “later.”  The R2 will operate on a new EV platform but looks like a smaller version of the R1S SUV. It will be capable of more than 300 miles of all-electric range on a single charge and 0-60 mph time in under3 seconds, the company said.  “R2 represents the essence of our brand, while targeting the significant midsized SUV segment, a massive market with limited compelling EV options beyond Tesla,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told investors last month. “R2 has been developed with vertically integrated propulsion platforms, electronics and software to create an incredible user experience.”  Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/07/rivian-r2-electric-suv-starting-price-performance.html";"664";"2024-03-07T20:53:44"

Looks like we had a nice little pop. I have liquidated almost all of my holdings in TUP. Currently holding 25 shares at $2.00. I have 1 put at $2 as well. I like to buy put options close to or ATM w/ long positions in stock. Nice little hedge to protect you from any downside.  My next speculative call is LCID. As of July 14. There are 2.27B shares Outs. Float of 406,097,447. Short Interest 167,766,715, roughly 41%. I do not necessarily see this as a squeeze yet. However, Bank of America just announced  that $90/ barrel is imminent. The oil supply in the US has drastically been declining. This will lead to higher prices for anything utilizing oil (Plastic, Gas, Polyurethane, Solvents, ETC.) This usually leads to people searching for cheaper alternatives.  Which is why LCID (EV in general) and anything pertaining to oil is on my watchlist. I wouldn't be surprised to see a dip and rip with anything oil.    WMT, I have been watching for quite some time now (over a year). I have a fairly large position in Walmart (over 100)  at strikes from $165-$220, about 90% expiring Dec..

The CTO of Walmart, in October of 22' said he expects crypto to be a major payment disruptor and a very important payment tool to use. In June of 2023, they opened their second automation facility. If that isn't enough, Walmart is a major contributor in the AI industry. They have embedded AI all over their facilities and have been buying AI IP. The  FTC is also looking into Amazons rigged search results and how they advertise for business owners. Sounds like they are forcing businesses to pay more for a higher product ranking. This is among a slew of other antitrust violations. amazon could be a great short with Walmart gaining market share. If the FTC follows through on their Amazon lawsuit and they succeed at breaking up amazon. It stands to reason that Walmart will gain the majority of Amazons market share.  https://corporate.walmart.com/IRL/](https://corporate.walmart.com/IRL/  https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2023/06/15/walmart-opens-high-tech-fulfillment-center-near-indianapolis](https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2023/06/15/walmart-opens-high-tech-fulfillment-center-near-indianapolis)   This is speculation and not financial advice.

"Powerhouse Picks: META, AMZN, or NFLX - Unveiling the most compelling FAANG stock";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13us12c/powerhouse_picks_meta_amzn_or_nflx_unveiling_the/";"   # Meta Platforms ($META)  Shares of social media giant Meta Platforms have rallied by a phenomenal 107% year-to-date. The company impressed investors by returning back to revenue growth in the first quarter (after three straight quarters of decline) despite subdued digital ad spending due to macro pressures.  Investors have also cheered the company’s aggressive cost-cutting and streamlining efforts, including thousands of layoffs. Despite the distraction caused by regulatory matters, most Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about Meta’s prospects.  Meta’s user base continues to expand, with daily active people (number of users who visited at least one of the family apps –Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp in a day) growing 5% year-over-year to 3.02 billion (on average) in March. The company expects capital expenditure of $30 billion to $33 billion this year toward the build-out of its artificial intelligence (AI) capacity to support ads, Feed, and Reels as well as increased investment in generative AI initiatives.  **Is Meta a Good Stock to Buy?**  On Tuesday, Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion reiterated a Buy rating on Meta Platforms stock with a price target of $270 after taking a deep look at the company’s AI capabilities.The analyst sees the company leveraging AI to boost user engagement, develop better and more automated advertiser tools, and create an open-source AI ecosystem. Champion is also optimistic about Meta’s positioning within the digital ads space.  ## Amazon ($AMZN)  Like Meta, Amazon is also reducing its costs to navigate a tough business backdrop. The company’s retail business has been under pressure due to the impact of macro challenges on consumer spending. Additionally, the slowdown in the growth rate of the higher-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has also been concerning. Enterprises are moderating their IT budgets, which is weighing on AWS’s growth.  Wall Street continues to be bullish on Amazon and sees solid potential in the retail and AWS divisions over the long term. Moreover, AMZN’s rapidly growing advertising business is also expected to boost revenue in the years ahead. Despite macro pressures, Amazon’s ad revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $9.5 billion in Q1.  **Is AMZN a Buy, Sell, or Hold?**  Earlier this week, Mizuho analyst James Lee increased his price target for Amazon to $160 from $145 and reiterated a Buy rating, calling the stock his top pick for the second half of 2023. The analyst expects multiple expansion as concerns about the company’s AI market position “diminish.”  Recent channel checks by Lee’s firm with a leading channel partner indicated that AWS’s generative AI demand has been accelerating due to the ease of transition and product differentiation.  “Case studies show that AWS wins over clients on intelligence privacy and data security,” said Lee. Further, he also highlighted that generative AI is priced meaningfully higher than conventional computing, so it is expected to be both revenue and margin accretive to AWS. Consequently, Lee believes AWS revenue growth will likely trough in Q2 before rebounding in the second half of the year.  ## Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)  Netflix’s crackdown on password sharing has improved investor sentiment about the streaming giant. Password sharing has been a key concern for Netflix, especially as competition has become intense in the streaming space. Netflix had previously estimated that over 100 million households share accounts, representing 43% of its global user base. This week, Netflix rolled out its password-sharing crackdown to its home market.  Aside from the password-sharing crackdown, Netflix’s business is expected to improve through its recent introduction of a cheaper, ad-supported tier.  **What is the Price Target for Netflix?**  On Thursday, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein increased the price target for Netflix stock to $450 from $415 and maintained a Buy rating in reaction to the launch of paid sharing offering at $7.99 per additional household stream.  Prior to the announcement, the analyst’s firm conducted a survey of 1,800 U.S. Netflix consumers. The survey indicated a healthy propensity to pay for “remote” users, with certain abandoned users willing to pay for their own subscriptions.  While 45% of respondents indicated a willingness to pay for “remote” users, 70% indicated an inclination for the $6.99 ad-tier plan. With pricing of the paid sharing option above the ad-tier, the survey suggests a significant portion of these users will be pushed toward the ad-based offer.  # Conclusion  Wall Street is more bullish on Meta Platforms and Amazon compared to Netflix. Given the massive rally in Meta stock, Wall Street sees higher upside potential in Amazon stock from current levels. Analysts mainly see solid potential in Amazon’s AWS cloud business, supported by solid demand for cloud computing and prospects for growth in the AI space.";"0";"2023-05-29T13:19:17"

"What's your largest individual stock holding? (No shilling, please).";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18mox4m/whats_your_largest_individual_stock_holding_no/";"Howdy everybody. Lately, I've been investing more in individual stocks that are undervalued, as opposed to putting it in ETF's that are at ATH. Thus far, my strategy has outperformed the overall market by quite a bit. I'm up 20% since starting this strategy about 6 months ago, versus the overall market being up by about 10% in the same time period. Yes, I understand there's inherently more risk with individual stocks. Also, FWIW, I'm not bragging, just giving some depth to the conversation and my reasoning for asking these questions. Anyway, moving on. I'm looking to expand that number of individual stock holdings, but also diversity into new holdings as opposed to taking bigger positions on what I already own. Im looking for crowd favorites for individual stock holdings. So my question to you all is this: For those who don't have *all* of their money in ETF's, what is the single stock you hold the most of? How much of that holding represents your overall portfolio? Are these long-term holdings, or have you purchased shares lately? Why is that particular stock your largest individual holding?   I'll leave mine out for the time being because I don't want this to come across as a shilling post or for it to devolve into an argument. I genuinely want to know what you guys are holding.

US short interest this month rose to the highest level since April 2022, as investors bet that the current bull run in the stock market is set to falter.  According to data from S3 Partners, the amount spent by short sellers against US stocks hit $1.02 trillion, as of Friday. Those bets came even as they continued to rally earlier this month, costing short sellers $101 billion.  S3 data shows that the top shorts are Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. As of Friday, their collective short interest topped $83 billion.  The bearish sentiment results from skepticism about how much higher stocks can go. So far this year, the S&P 500 is up 13.5%, and the Nasdaq is up 29%.  But since the Federal Reserve last week indicated more rate hikes are on the table this year, stocks have been on a losing streak.  This year, Wall Street has been caught up in the hype over artificial intelligence companies, which saw their valuations skyrocket and have brought more investors into the market due to ""fear of missing out.""  But big names have voiced divided outlooks on the AI frenzy. For instance, while Stanley Druckenmiller sees Nvidia as a stock worth holding for the next couple of years, short seller Jim Chanos has demonstrated skepticism towards the stock.  Meanwhile, the prospect of continued hawkishness from the Fed has added to macroeconomic risks. A recent Goldman Sachs report put the odds of a recession in the next 12 months at 25% and warned a downturn could cause a 23% decline in the S&P 500.  Still, if bullish investors win out, short positions could eventually support market gains, as a short squeeze forces more buying and boosts stocks.";"0";"2023-06-24T12:48:34"

"AWS acquires Talen’s nuclear data center campus in Pennsylvania -";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b6k4j4/aws_acquires_talens_nuclear_data_center_campus_in/";"[https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/aws-acquires-talens-nuclear-data-center-campus-in-pennsylvania/](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/aws-acquires-talens-nuclear-data-center-campus-in-pennsylvania/)  Amazon Web Services (AWS) has acquired Talen Energy’s data center campus at a nuclear power station in Pennsylvania.      Talen Energy Corporation this week announced it has sold its 960MW Cumulus data center campus in Pennsylvania to a ‘major cloud service provider’ – listed as Amazon in a Talen investor presentation. Amazon is yet to comment on the news.  According to the investor presentation, Talen sold the site and assets of Cumulus Data for $650 million. The deal comprises $350 million at close and $300m escrowed, released upon development milestones anticipated in 2024.      ""We are pleased today to have sold our Cumulus data center campus, unlocking significant value for Talen,"" said Talen president and CEO Mac McFarland. ""This transaction provides an attractive return on Talen's investment and vision in building Cumulus, and creates value through the sale of clean carbon-free power from our top-decile Susquehanna nuclear plant.""      First announced by DCD in July 2021, the 1,200-acre campus draws power from Talen Energy’s neighboring 2.5GW nuclear power station in Luzerne County, the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station (SSES). The company broke ground in 2021 and completed the first 48MW, 300,000 square foot (28,870 sqm) hyperscale facility early last year, along with a separate cryptomine facility.      Talen said AWS aims to develop a 960MW data center campus. The cloud company has minimum contractual power commitments that ramp up in 120MW increments over several years: AWS has a one-time option to cap commitments at 480MW. The cloud provider also has two 10-year extension options, tied to nuclear license renewals      As part of the deal, Talen will also supply AWS with energy via a 10-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) from the Susquehanna site.      Commissioned in 1983 for energy company PPL, the 2,494MW Susquehanna Steam Electric Station is one of the largest nuclear power plants in the US. Its current owner, Talen Energy, was founded in 2015 after the competitive power generation business of PPL Corporation was spun off and combined with competitive generation businesses owned by private equity firm Riverstone Holdings.      Talen Energy formed Cumulus Growth in 2020 to ‘invest in opportunities created by the convergence of digital infrastructure and power’ and had two separate businesses: Cumulus Data, focused on hyperscale data centers: and Cumulus Coin, focused on digital currency mining.      In an ESG report from March 2021, Talen said the company was “well-positioned to capture value” in areas such as data centers and digital coins, saying the two business areas could be a “stable source of income outside of the traditional market.”  &#x200B:";"25";"2024-03-04T20:43:32"

"Shopify ($SHOP) up 85% this year, time to sell the stock?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14d9vce/shopify_shop_up_85_this_year_time_to_sell_the/";"* Shopify is a leading e-commerce platform growing faster than the overall industry. * The company botched its logistics investments and is now facing pressure from Amazon. * Shares look extremely expensive at these prices.  # Growth prospects look strong, but don't forget that price matters.  Stocks have soared to start 2023, reversing a lot of the painful losses for investors in 2021 and 2022. Growth stocks have especially rallied, with many stocks greatly outpacing the 15% gains for the S&P 500 index year to date (YTD). Shopify (SHOP -2.10%) is one of these growth companies.      Shares of the e-commerce software and payments platform have popped 85% YTD, with the stock now sporting a market cap of $83.5 billion. Since the company went public in 2015, shares are up 2,200%, making it one of the top-performing stocks worldwide over that time span, especially for large-cap companies.        With the stock up so much this year, should you sell your shares of Shopify and walk away? Or are there still more gains to be had in this growth compounder?      Growing faster than peers but without cost discipline   One thing all investors can agree on with Shopify is that it's growing quickly and gaining market share with its core e-commerce services. Last quarter, payment volume through its merchant customers grew 18% year over year in constant currency, which is much quicker than the 10% projected growth for the global e-commerce market this year.  Revenue is growing even quicker than payment volume, up 27% year over year to $1.5 billion in the first quarter. This is occurring as more merchants and customers are adopting Shopify's internal payment processor, which allows it to earn a sizable take rate on every transaction processed through its platform. In the first quarter, internal payments volume was 56% of total payments volume compared to 51% in 2022. If this trend continues, it will lead to Shopify's revenue growing quicker than its total payment volume, which is already outpacing the overall e-commerce market. This is a good recipe for durable double-digit revenue growth.      While revenue growth has been great, Shopify has shown a lack of efficiency with its cost structure. In the first quarter, the company posted an operating loss of $193 million -- or 13% of revenue -- compared to 8% of revenue a year ago. With the platform closing in on $6 billion in annual revenue, there is no excuse for Shopify to not generate any bottom-line profits. These losses will need to reverse in the next few years, especially if revenue continues to compound to even higher levels.   # Fumbling the logistics opportunity, competition with Amazon payments  Over the last few years, Shopify has talked a big vertical integration game about how it would start competing with Amazon in delivery and logistics for its merchants. It spent $2.1 billion acquiring start-up Deliverr and said it would invest billions of dollars into the Shopify Fulfillment Network.  But in 2023, after realizing Deliverr had negative gross margins and that it could not compete with the tens of billions in infrastructure spending from Amazon, UPS, and FedEx, Shopify did a complete U-turn and exited all of its logistics investments, including divesting its Deliverr acquisition to Flexport. The company not only wasted a ton of money trying to invest in logistics, but this exit now significantly shrinks Shopify's addressable market, a big selling point for growth investors interested in the stock.      This competition with Amazon may only get worse. Last year, the technology giant released a beta version of the ""Buy With Prime"" button, which allows merchants to process payments and shipping on their own third-party websites exactly as they would when selling on Amazon. Most of Shopify's revenue comes from its own payment processor, meaning its revenue will take a hit if any merchant customers start offering Buy With Prime. Since the payment buttons are all the same for the consumer, it is likely that many e-commerce shoppers would switch to the Amazon solution if it means the fastest shipping times.    # The valuation doesn't make sense at these prices  Even with the looming risk from Amazon, Shopify shares have soared this year and now sport a steep valuation that makes the math for positive forward returns very difficult.     For one, even though it looks like a software company, Shopify's gross margins are much lower than you might think. As you can see from the above chart, the company only generated $2.8 billion in gross profit over the past 12 months compared to $5.9 billion in revenue, or a margin of 47%. A mature company run efficiently can generally convert around half of its gross profit into earnings. Since Shopify is an aggressive spender, let's say it will convert a bit less at maturity and hit 20% net profit margins.  If Shopify is able to fend off looming competition from companies like Amazon and keep growing revenue at 20% a year, it will hit $14.7 billion in revenue five years from now. With a 20% profit margin, that equates to $2.9 billion in earnings. Compared to its current market cap of $83.5 billion, that would be a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 28.5 five years from now. This is higher than the market average today and requires Shopify to grow its revenue at a 20% annual rate for five straight years.       The math doesn't work for Shopify at these prices unless you believe the company will accelerate its growth rate or magically expand its profitability. Even though it means a tax hit if you've held for many years, now is looking like a good time to sell your shares of Shopify and redeploy the cash into cheaper stocks.";"0";"2023-06-19T11:37:29"
"How Shopify ($SHOP) 'shape shift' made e-commerce firm attractive again";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/149t8tf/how_shopify_shop_shape_shift_made_ecommerce_firm/";"E-commerce software and services provider Shopify ($SHOP) suddenly looks a lot different to investors in the wake of a strategy shift. Canada-based Shopify in early June completed the sale of its fulfillment unit, easing investor angst over rising investments for SHOP stock.      With the move, Canada-based Shopify slashed capital spending and improved its financial outlook.      ""Post the recent 'shape shift' where it exited the logistics business and reduced over 20% of the workforce, the company is free cash flow positive,"" said UBS analyst Kunal Madhukar in a recent report.     **Covid Emergency E-Commerce Boost**   Further, Shopify stock has jumped 90% in 2023 as of June 14. Shopify stock has gained 42% since the company announced the sale of the fulfillment business to privately held Flexport on May 4. SHOP stock rebounded from a 2022 sell-off spurred by worries over growing investments and management turnover.      Shares are trading near a 14-month high, trying to clear a short consolidation forged after surging on May 4 following the first-quarter earnings report and the Flexport deal.   ""While SFN (Shopify Fulfillment Network) turned out to be an expensive experiment, we also must recognize that Shopify made a fast pivot — taking calculated risks can sometimes lead to strategic mistakes,"" said Baird analyst Colin Sebastian in a report. ""We still believe Shopify can be a trillion-dollar GMV (gross merchandise volume) platform with take rates expanding as the company widens in scope.""      In 2022, Shopify's GMV growth slowed to 12% ($197.2 billion). GMV growth has been trending down since 2020 when it boomed 96% during the coronavirus pandemic. Consumers shifted to online shopping during the emergency. In addition, Shopify in 2022 accounted for roughly 18% of all U.S. e-commerce, says UBS.      According to research firm Gartner, Shopify is the largest e-commerce software provider with about 15% global share, ahead of SAP (SAP) and Salesforce (CRM). Shopify garners nearly two-thirds of revenue from the U.S.      Shopify sets up e-commerce websites for businesses. It partners with companies such as Stripe to handle digital payments. Well-funded and fast-growing Stripe has put off an initial public offering.      Among merchants services is Shop Pay. It's an accelerated checkout option for stores on the Shopify platform. Shopify Capital provides loans to merchants. The new Shop Cash rewards program provides consumers with incentives, aiming to boost GMV through higher orders.      **SHOP Stock: PayPal Friction?**   Meanwhile, Shopify has encroached on PayPal Holdings (PYPL), said Lisa Ellis, analyst at SVB MoffettNathanson in a report.      ""PayPal and Shopify have a long-standing partnership and PayPal enjoys a privileged position on the Shopify platform,"" said Ellis in a report. ""However, many of Shopify's payments-related initiatives pose a competitive threat to PayPal.""      She noted Shopify Payments, a payment processing service offered through Stripe. Ellis also noted a ""buy now, pay later"" consumer financing service that Shopify now offers through Affirm Holdings (AFRM).      Meanwhile, to build up a logistics business that stored and shipped products for its merchant customers, Shopify had acquired Deliverr for $2.1 billion in 2022. In 2019 it bought startup 6 River Systems for $450 million.      Flexport will be Shopify's logistics partner under a revenue-sharing arrangement. Shopify now holds a 13% equity interest in Flexport.      **Shopify To Join Amazon Buy With Prime?**   Amid the sale, there's also speculation over a possible Shopify deal with e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN).      Amazon now offers its massive distribution network to merchants that do not sell goods on its website. Amazon's product fulfillment services are part of a program called Buy With Prime.      At UBS, Madhukar says Shopify could join the Buy With Prime program based on management comments on Shopify's first-quarter earnings call.      ""The company said things are moving positively in their discussions with Amazon on BwP, which could suggest they may be closer to getting a deal done,"" Madhukar said. ""Although it is still unclear whether a deal will make SHOP whole on gross profit dilution, a resolution could result in a better merchant and consumer experience, and lead to higher volumes that may offset any potential dilution.""      Also, Shopify rival BigCommerce (BGIC) uses Amazon's fulfillment services.      Started in 2006, Shopify recently hiked contract prices for merchants.      In the quarter ended March 31, Shopify earned one cent per share on an adjusted basis, down a penny from a year earlier. Revenue for SHOP stock rose 25% to $1.5 billion, the company said.      Analysts expected the Shopify earnings report to show a loss of 4 cents on revenue of $1.435 billion. Gross merchandise volume rose 15% to $49.6 billion, topping estimates of $47.75 billion.      In 2023, Wall Street analysts expect adjusted profit to boom to 33 cents a share from 4 cents last year. Shopify earnings per share is projected to rise 70% to 56 cents in 2024.   Revenue will rise 20% to $6.74 billion this year and 18% in 2024 to $7.93 billion, analysts predict.      Shopify Stock: Enterprise Marketing Push   To spur GMV growth for SHOP stock, Shopify has partnered with Facebook (FB), Pinterest (PINS) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google in social media marketing.      Meanwhile, analysts expect Shopify to target larger companies.      In May, Shopify launched a program called Commerce Components. It enables businesses to integrate Shopify's checkout and back-office services with their existing online platforms. Further, toymaker Mattel (MAT) is one early customer.      ""Subscription pricing increase that rolled out at the end of April will be a key catalyst supporting topline growth and margins,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney in a report. ""And Shopify continues to drive product innovations, especially for enterprise solutions. Commerce Components offers a lightweight solution for large enterprises without replacing the merchants' whole online infrastructure.""";"24";"2023-06-15T07:00:44"

"UPS Signs minimum hourly wage increase of 35.5% for part-time workers and average total driver compensation to $170,000.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15yi1fq/ups_signs_minimum_hourly_wage_increase_of_355_for/";"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/22/ups-workers-approve-new-labor-contract.html  * Part time workers will make $21 from currently $15.50. * Full time workers will be paid $49 an hour an increase of $7.50 over the contract.  Total compensation with benefits will be $170,000.   * Average base pay before overtime or benefits will be approximately $102,000. * The new contract includes pay raises for both part-time and full-time workers. * It also includes other improvements to work rules including an end to forced overtime. * Workers began voting on the new contract on August 2.  American Airlines also approved 46% increase in compensation and the UAW is also demanding 46% increase in compensation, voting on August 22nd whether or not to authorize a strike.  UPS workers ratified a massive five-year labor deal that includes big wage increases and other improvements to work rules and schedules, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said Tuesday.  The deal passed with 86.3% of votes, the highest contract vote in the history of Teamsters at UPS, according to the union.  “Teamsters have set a new standard and raised the bar for pay, benefits, and working conditions in the package delivery industry. This is the template for how workers should be paid and protected nationwide, and nonunion companies like Amazon better pay attention,” Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien said in a statement.  UPS and the Teamsters union, which represents about 340,000 workers at the delivery giant, reached a preliminary deal last month, narrowly averting a strike that could have rippled throughout the U.S. economy as the previous contract expiration on July 31 approached.  UPS moves $3.8 billion worth of goods a day, about 5% of the country’s gross domestic product, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  The parties had until July 31, when the previous labor contract was set to expire, to reach a deal and avoid a work stoppage. Workers began voting on the new contract on August 2. It’s the single largest collective bargaining agreement ever reached in the private sector, according to the union.  Part-time workers will make no less than $21 an hour, up from a minimum of $15.50 currently, according to the union. Part-time pay was a sticking point during labor negotiations. Full-time workers will average $49 an hour. Current workers will get $2.75 more an hour this year and $7.50 an hour more during the five-year contract.  UPS drivers will average $170,000 in pay and benefits at the end of the five-year deal, CEO Carol Tomé said on an earnings call earlier this month.  The company cut its full-year revenue and margin forecasts, citing the “volume impact from labor negotiations and the costs associated with the tentative agreement.”  The union is the latest labor organization to push a major U.S. company for better pay, schedules and other work rules in the wake of the pandemic and decades-high inflation.  On Monday, American Airlines pilots ratified a four-year deal that includes roughly 46% increases in compensation, including 401(k) contributions, a deal the carrier sweetened after rival United Airlines reached a richer agreement with its pilots’ union. Delta Air Lines  ’ pilots approved their deal, which include more than 30% raises, earlier this year.  Southwest Airlines  hasn’t yet gotten to a deal with its pilots’ union, which has laid the groundwork for a potential strike, though such stoppages in the airline industry are exceedingly rare under U.S. laws.  FedEx pilots turned down a tentative agreement for a new labor contract earlier this summer.";"2232";"2023-08-22T22:45:44"

Streaming advertising revenue will pass the $9 billion mark in the U.S. this year, the Ampere study forecasts. “The introduction of cheaper ad tiers has been successful not only in increasing new subscriber growth in previously saturated markets, but also in acting as an additional revenue source for streaming services,” the firm explained. Revenue will be further “bolstered” by Amazon Prime Video’s new advertising tier launched this quarter, it highlighted.*  *“Most major streaming services in the U.S. have launched their hybrid advertising tiers, which, along with increasing clampdowns on password sharing, have been successful at reigniting growth in the streaming market,” said Rory Gooderick, senior analyst at Ampere.*      *Goodrick added, “There is still a way forward for pay TV, however. Disney and Charter’s recent deal in the U.S., which gave almost 15 million Charter subscribers access to Disney+’s advertising tier, shows how the two businesses can work together to maximize streaming’s reach to domestic subscribers and highlights the importance of traditional distribution platforms as service aggregators. Longer-term contracts and the reduction in churn make this an attractive proposition for streamers, while control over the billing relationship also means there’s something in it for the pay-TV provider.”*    ***.....End of article.....***  ***Source***: *https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/streaming-overtake-pay-tv-subscription-revenue-us-q3-2024-ampere-analysis-1235835978/*";"108";"2024-02-27T20:23:17"

A Zoom spokesperson confirmed the cuts amount to less than 2% of the company’s workforce.  “We regularly evaluate our teams to ensure alignment with our strategy,” the spokesperson told CNBC in a statement. “As part of this effort, we are rescoping roles to add capabilities and continue to hire in critical areas for the future.”  Zoom said the layoffs are not companywide, and added that it will continue to hire for roles in artificial intelligence, sales, product and across operations in 2024.  The cuts at Zoom were first reported by Bloomberg.  As of Thursday, more than 100 tech companies have laid off about 30,000 employees to start the year, according to layoffs.fyi. January was the busiest month for job cuts in the industry since March.  Last month, Microsoft  cut 1,900 positions in its gaming division: Google  said it’s eliminating hundreds of roles across the company: and Amazon  laid off employees across its Prime Video, MGM Studios, Twitch and Audible divisions.  In addition to Zoom, cloud software vendor Okta  announced a downsizing on Thursday, telling employees that it’s laying off 400 staffers, or about 7% of its workforce.  Zoom exploded in popularity at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as workers turned to the video-conferencing platform to stay in touch with colleagues, friends and family. But as the pandemic subsided and many workers returned to in-person roles, Zoom’s stock has stumbled.  Zoom shares are down about 10% this year and have dropped almost 90% from their record high in October 2020.

Treasury yields retreated. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 3.714%, down from 3.782% Wednesday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.  Analysts attributed the relative calm to traders taking a wait-and-see attitude ahead of key events next week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release fresh data on inflation Tuesday, while the Federal Reserve will announce its latest interest-rate decision Wednesday.  So far, positioning in futures markets suggests many traders are betting the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged in June. That might offer markets some relief in the short-term, although investors warn that there could still be more policy-tightening ahead.   “A pause does not mean they are done with rate hikes,” said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors.   Traders are betting volatility could pick up in the coming months. The options contracts with the biggest positions tied to the Cboe Volatility Index, or Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” are wagers that it will surge to 30—a level associated with investor anxiety—or 60, a level only seen during stock-market crashes.  Among individual stocks, electric-car maker Tesla jumped 4.6% to $234.86, posting its 10th straight session of gains. That marked the company’s longest winning streak since an 11-session run that ended in January 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data.   Carvana, the online used car retailer, rose 56% to $24.23 after saying it expects its profit to jump in the second quarter.  GameStop plunged 18% to $21.44 after the videogame retailer fired its CEO, Matt Furlong, and appointed board member Ryan Cohen as its new executive chairman.   U.S. crude oil prices initially dropped after a report suggested U.S.-Iran talks on a temporary nuclear deal could allow the Islamic Republic to export more crude. They pared some of their losses by the end of the trading day, though, finishing down 1.7% at $71.29 a barrel.  Global stock markets were mixed. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.3% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 retreated 0.9%.

"Speculative Crap I'm Investing In So You Don't Have to";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b6k1qh/speculative_crap_im_investing_in_so_you_dont_have/";"Alright folks, mega caps and AI are all the rave but there's plenty of rather unknown companies which are growing their earning's at a tremendous rate. My portfolio in 2022 was Costco, Nvidia, Apple, Google and MSFT. They all did beautifully but they're too big for my liking now. Here's the speculative crap I'm investing in now  **1. GigaCloud Technology** \- Is like an Amazon or Alibaba but removes the consumer and does B2B ecommerce, no debt, strong cash flow, P/E ratio still reasonable for massive YoY growth. Already up a lot on this company and earning's coming up Q4 which expecting big beat.  **2.** **Vita-Coco** \- Everyone's all about Celsius or Monster, Coconut Water imo is the next best thing with a growing market, COCO, is the market leader. Summer's here, coming off winter lows and just had big beat in Q4 which normally worst quarter when its cold. Summer they partner with alcoholic brands and all the weight loss craze leads me to believe ppl are choosing healthy drink alternatives.  **3. Braze** \- Companies need a way to stay in touch with their customers, Braze creates a subscription model which handles all types of communication with customers and automates the process. This company is working its way towards becoming profitable. I was watching YT channel who interviews entrepreneurs, saw freelancer making $150k+ a year using the software to help companies so to me that's huge to see in the real world without even having looked for the company.  **4. Draft Kings** \- California and Texas still have not legalized online gambling which those two states alone are absolutely massive. Texas won't vote on it again until 2025, casino's in Oklahoma donate to Texan politicians to help influence keeping gambling out of the state but 2025 imo we see big changes. There's a huge catalyst here and earning's are growing with combat sports massively growing.  **5.** **Sofi -** The numbers don't lie. When rate cuts were plausibly announced we saw a massive jump. This company wants to run when rate cuts come but until then ppl really weary even though the numbers and guidance are phenomenal.  **6. Palantir** \- S&P500 inclusion didn't come after 5 quarters now of GAAP profitability, so in June imo we'll see it happen which is a huge catalyst. The earning's are growing as a we all know. I don't like the P/E ratio but this is a company I'd buy and immediately sell CC's on and keep selling CC""s until reaching my assigned price and repeating while holding long term.  Everyone of these companies imo has strong growing earning's, relatively unknown still compared to what everyone's piling into, and most have major catalysts coming up. COCO has summer, DK has legalization of massive states, Sofi has pending rate cuts, Palantir has sp500 inclusion, at least Braze and Giga about to report and beat as they do Q4 which should act as minor catalysts imo.";"541";"2024-03-04T20:40:23"

I have been operating a business the past 6 years and have about $500k in a high-yield savings account.  I held more cash than I think I would have liked to because I wanted to reinvest in the business and potentially try some new ideas.    &#x200B:  Nonetheless I am sitting on post-tax cash of $500k.  I already have $335k in 401(k) with 100% in VTI.  Although the Marcus high yield savings is great I feel like I am sitting on way too much cash. Ideally I want to hold at least $150k so I have runway for business for the next year or two.     Obviously all of us wish we had thrown a large brick of cash into tech stocks, etc. at the end of 2022 - trying not to let that sting but it definitely is hard feeling like I could have just thrown money into stocks and not had to work so hard building a business - hindsight bias is a bitch lol.  I am grateful to be in this position but still feel like I have totally missed the boat.  &#x200B:  I am thinking about putting like $300k into Google, Amazon and Microsoft because I feel that cloud computing and AI are only going to become more popular.  I use AWS a lot and see almost all of my clients using AWS.  Also maybe Apple just because they have a really good moat.  &#x200B:  Bottom line is should I just throw excess capital into tech stocks, put it all in VTI or do something else?  I calculate if I just do VTI and chill it will be worth like $5M later but I am like...AI is going to change earth, needs significant compute from the cloud and even though I missed the 2023 runup in tech it feels like there is still a lot of growth left.

"Reddit pops 38% in NYSE debut to open at $47 per share";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bkbxrj/reddit_pops_38_in_nyse_debut_to_open_at_47_per/";"Reddit shares jumped 38% on Thursday to open at $47 in the first initial public offering for a major social media company since Pinterest’s debut in 2019.  The 19-year-old website that hosts millions of online forums priced its IPO on Wednesday at $34 a share, the top of the expected range. Reddit and selling shareholders raised about $750 million from the offering, with the company collecting about $519 million.  Trading under the ticker symbol “RDDT,” Reddit is testing investor appetite for new tech stocks after an extended dry spell for IPOs. Since the peak of the technology boom in late 2021, hardly any venture-backed tech companies have gone public and those that have — like Instacart and Klaviyo last year — have underwhelmed. On Wednesday, data center hardware company Astera Labs made its public market debut on Nasdaq and saw its shares soar 72%, underscoring investor excitement over businesses tied to the boom in artificial intelligence.  Reddit is taking a haircut from its private market valuation of $10 billion in 2021, a boom year for the tech industry. The mood changed a year later, however, when investors became concerned over rising interest rates and soaring inflation and exited high-risk assets. In response, startups conducted layoffs, trimmed their valuations, and shifted focus to profit over growth.  Reddit’s annual sales for 2023 rose 20% to $804 million from $666.7 million a year earlier, the company detailed in its prospectus. The company recorded a net loss of $90.8 million last year, narrower than its loss of $158.6 million in 2022.  Based on its revenue over the past four quarters, Reddit’s $6.5 billion market cap at IPO gives it a price-to-sales ratio of about 8. Alphabet trades for 6.1 times revenue, Meta has a multiple of 9.7, Pinterest’s sits at 7.5 and Snap trades for 3.9 times sales, according to FactSet.  In addition to those companies, Reddit also counts X, Discord, Wikipedia and Amazon’s Twitch streaming service as competitors in its prospectus.  Reddit is betting that data licensing could become a major source of revenue, and said in its filing that it’s entered “certain data licensing arrangements with an aggregate contract value of $203.0 million and terms ranging from two to three years.” This year, Reddit said it plans to recognize roughly $66.4 million in revenue as part of its data licensing deals.  Google has also entered into an expanded partnership with Reddit, allowing the search giant to obtain more access to Reddit data to train AI models and improve its products.  Reddit revealed on March 15 that the Federal Trade Commission is conducting a non-public inquiry “focused on our sale, licensing, or sharing of user-generated content with third parties to train AI models.” Reddit said it was “not surprised that the FTC has expressed interest” in the company’s data licensing practices related to AI, and that it doesn’t believe that it has “engaged in any unfair or deceptive trade practice.”  Reddit was founded in 2005 by technology entrepreneurs Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, the company’s CEO. Existing stakeholders, including Huffman, sold a combined 6.7 million shares in the IPO.  As part of the IPO, Reddit gave some of its top moderators and users, known as Redditors, a chance to buy stock through a directed-share program. Companies like Airbnb, Doximity and Rivian have used similar programs to reward their power users and customers.  “I hope they believe in Reddit and support Reddit,” Huffman told CNBC in an interview on Thursday. “But  the goal is just to get them in the deal. Just like any professional investor.”  Redditors have expressed skepticism about the IPO, both because of the company’s financials and its often troubled relationship with moderators. Huffman said he recognizes that reality and acknowledged the controversial subreddit Wallstreetbets, which helped spawn the boom in meme stocks like GameStop.  “That’s the beautiful thing about Reddit, is that they tell it like it is,” Huffman said. “But you have to remember they’re doing that on Reddit. It’s a platform they love, it’s their home on the internet.”  OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is one of Reddit’s major shareholders along with Tencent and Advance Magazine Publishers, the parent company of publishing giant Condé Nast. Altman’s stake in the company was worth over $400 million before the stock began trading. Altman led a $50 million funding round into Reddit in 2014 and was a member of its board from 2015 through 2022.

Cyber Monday is expected to hit $12.4 billion, making it the biggest online shopping day of the year. E-commerce-focused retailers like Etsy, Wayfair, Amazon, and Shopify saw stock surges. Analysts monitor these sales as a barometer for the overall holiday shopping season.       Despite inflation and high grocery prices, the National Retail Federation predicts a 3% to 4% YoY increase in November and December sales.      Buy-now-pay-later services, including Affirm, Klarna, and Afterpay, drove $5.9 billion in online spending, up 13.4% from last year. Klarna's CEO highlighted the significant market share gained by such services. New entrants like TikTok and Temu capitalized on holiday demand with promotions, offering discounts and deals.

"Cisco cutting 5% of global workforce in restructuring move";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aqy1qd/cisco_cutting_5_of_global_workforce_in/";"Cisco announced plans to cut 5% of its workforce on Wednesday, a decision that will result in the elimination of about 4,250 jobs. Shares were down 4% in extended trading.  It’s the latest tech company to downsize in 2024, as the industry continues to squeeze out costs following the market downturn that hit two years ago. January was the busiest month for job cuts in the industry since March, as Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and SAP all said they were eliminating positions, as did eBay Unity and Discord. So far this year, 144 tech companies have laid off almost 35,000 workers, according to the website Layoffs.fyi.  In addition to disclosing the job cuts, Cisco reported strong fiscal second-quarter results but gave a light forecast. Here’s how it did in comparison with the consensus from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:  Earnings per share: 87 cents, adjusted, vs. 84 cents expected  Revenue: $12.79 billion, vs. $12.71 billion expected  Cisco’s revenue declined 6% year over year during the quarter, which ended on Jan. 27, according to a statement. Net income declined to $2.63 billion, or 65 cents per share, from $2.77 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.  Revenue from networking products totaled $7.08 billion, slightly below the $7.10 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.  With respect to guidance, Cisco called for 84 to 86 cents per share on $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for 92 cents per share on $13.09 billion in revenue.  For the full year, Cisco sees $3.68 to $3.74 in adjusted earnings per share and $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion in revenue. Analysts had projected $3.86 in adjusted earnings per share, with $54.26 billion in revenue.

People are still moving (upper middle class) and finding new jobs, many that require relocation. People who helped pump W to go over 10X in 2020 are the same people who will buy things from them during the holiday season, if they move hundreds of miles away, etc.   ORCL \[Oralce\] = They are a powerhouse of a company - the small caps cannot compete, and I am unaware of a single company that I've used who has stopped using them to use another product.

"Has Spotify run up too much? They have a margin problem";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b6mjm1/has_spotify_run_up_too_much_they_have_a_margin/";"Spotify stock has gone on a huge tear lately, almost quadrupling its stock price from a recent low around USD 70-75 to currently over 271. I’m sure this has to do with several consecutive earnings reports in which they demonstrated that they could:  1. Increase the number of subscribers and even re-accelerate growth despite their huge size 2. Squeeze more money from subscribers and increase ARPU, despite growing quickly outside of Europe and the USA where revenue per user tends to be lower.    While this is positive news and doubling premium subscribers since 2020 (while facing heavy competition) is impressive, I’m struggling to see how they will ever turn this revenue into profit.   The problem is twofold:   1. Spotify is totally beholden to major music labels which operate in an oligopolistic market. Spotify pays royalties to labels whenever a song is played, and they cannot at all afford to lose any of the labels. No one would use a music streaming service that is missing the entire catalogue of all major artists signed to one of the labels. So as Spotify gets more users, not only do they automatically have to pay more money for more plays, the labels can renegotiate and demand more money. This problem becomes apparent in their gross margins (more on that later).    2. Spotify is the only major pure play music streaming service. Their competition is Apple Music, Google/Youtube Premium, Amazon Prime. Excluding China, these make up well over 90% of the global market, but all their competitors have far more ability to bundle their services/subscriptions and run the music streaming at loss/breakeven by increasing royalty payments. Now, Spotify holds about 30% of the global market share compared to Apple Music at 13.7%, Amazon at 13.3% and Google at 9% (according to MIDIA Research). So they are the market leader by far which has its benefits. But switching streaming providers, while not totally painless, is easy enough that I believe they would lose a lot of subscribers if they raise prices too high.    A few numbers that seem to underline my thoughts:   In 2023 they raised premium prices for the first time ever(!) in the USA, to 10.99. This is the same exact price as Apple and YouTube Music (without YouTube Premium). While a good deal for customers, it shows they have no pricing power.    Their gross margin in the last quarter was 25.6%. Not only is this in fact lower than their gross margin right after their IPO 6 years ago (25.7%), it is a margin that doesn’t seem to support their valuation of 3.6 currently.    Premium subscriptions are their main source of revenue at 86% of total revenue. This number has not changed in over 2 years. Ad supported revenue not only has a terrible 11.6% gross margin but is not growing in a meaningful way.    Their other initiatives like podcasting and some hardware experiments have mostly failed. In fact they decided to release the Joe Rogan podcast on other services despite sinking several hundred millions into it. they are now trying to push audiobooks and merch sales as new profit drivers. Those are nice to have but I doubt they’ll make a meaningful difference. It seems to me if you are enough of a fan of an artist to buy their merch, you will just do it on their Website.    Their one positive seems to be increasing free cash flow, which has roughly doubled in the past three years. They seem to be succeeding at generating some operating leverage. However with a 26% gross margin their biggest cost driver by far remains royalty payments.    I guess the stock has some appeal as the market leader and main pure play publicly listed music streaming company, but to me it seems like a short candidate.

"Study found a strong positive relationship between employee wellbeing, firm performance, and stock performance";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/174dbtm/study_found_a_strong_positive_relationship/";"A [study](https://wellbeing.hmc.ox.ac.uk/papers/wp-2304-workplace-wellbeing-and-firm-performance/) analysed data on firm performance (return on assets, gross profit, and company valuation) and data from Indeed on work/employee wellbeing, which was a survey about stress, satisfication, happinness, and purpose at work. The study found a strong positive relationship was found between employee wellbeing, return on assets, gross profit, company valuation, and stock performance. Relevant graphs: [https://imgur.com/a/k4YiCPG](https://imgur.com/a/k4YiCPG).  The study also used employee happiness data from Indeed between October 2019 and February 2020 (pre-COVID) to predict firm performance during 2020 and 2021 and found that employee happiness predicted future firm performance.  The study analysed the impact of employee wellbeing on firm performance for 5 industries:  * services * finance, insurance, and real estate * wholesale and trade * transportation and public utilties * manufacturing  Agriculture, mining, and construction were not analysed due to an insufficient sample size. Employee wellbeing had a positive effect for the services, finance, insurance, real estate, and manufacturing industries, with the largest positive effect occurring for the services industry. For wholesale, trade, transportation, and public utilties, the effects were mostly insignificant. Though, due to the smaller sample size when broken down by industry, the study mentioned that the industry-specific results were less precise than the other results and should be treated as an exploratory initial analysis.  The study also found that the top 50 and top 100 highest wellbeing companies outperformed the S&P500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones over January 2021 to March 2023, which was the period analysed. The total return of the top 50 was higher than the top 100. The outcomes were the same when they analysed the stock performance of the top 100 companies for stressfree, satisfication, happinness, and purpose individually.  Based on literature, the study discussed 6 potential reasons for these results: productivity, relationships, creativity, health, recruitment, and retention. The discussion is long, so see the study for the full discussion and supporting evidence. For a very brief summary:  * Employee wellbeing was linked to employee performance. Employees with higher wellbeing worked faster, more efficiently, and more effectively. * Happier employees developed more supportive relationships with colleagues and supervisors, demonstrated higher capacities for cooperation and collaboration, had more satisfied and loyal customer, and were better negotiators. * A wide body of research demonstrated the importance of wellbeing in promoting creativity, generally defined as the production of novel and useful ideas. Happier people had greater mental flexibility and broader awareness, thereby enabling them to make sparse connections and generate original ideas. * There was a very strong relationship between wellbeing and health. Poor physical and mental health was linked to reduced work performance primarily due to higher rates of absenteeism and presenteeism. Employees with low job satisfaction have been found to be more likely to leave work early, arrive at work late, and miss days of work entirely. * Jobseekers valued employee wellbeing and avoided firms with poor wellbeing, which impacted the ability of firms to attract talent. A study examined the effects of randomly exposing job seekers to information about company happiness levels on Indeed. The experiment involved more than 23 million job seekers in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, and found that job seekers responded behaviorally to this information, by redirecting their applications away from low happiness companies to happier ones. Much of this effect was driven by job seekers “screening out” low happiness firms from their job search. In follow-up analyses, the study found that by improving their score, companies could attract more applications from people viewing the company on the platform. * There was a negative relationship between employee wellbeing and turnover. High employee wellbeing predicted lower rates of turnover. Turnover was costly for firms. Estimates of organizational costs associated with turnover from the United States Department of Labor ranged from one half to five times of the workers’ original annual salary. Some of these costs were due to lost productivity, rehiring, retraining, and loss of skill and knowledge \[1\]. The annual turnover/separation rates in 2021 and 2022 were 47% \[2\]\[3\]. In 2019, Gallup estimated US businesses were losing $1 trillion annually due to voluntary turnover \[4\].  The study cited multiple studies for each point, but they only scratched the surface. There was a very large amount of literature on employee wellbeing which basically all supported the relationship between employee wellbeing, productivity, mental health, physical health, turnover, workplace injury, business costs, and etc.  References  1.

"MercadoLibre seems absurdly undervalued.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16edgp1/mercadolibre_seems_absurdly_undervalued/";"My portfolio is up 50% this year.  I have a portfolio that is 100% growth stocks and I’ve taken some time to look at valuations to evaluate if I have companies that seem to be over their skis in terms of valuation.  I’ve been looking at lots of stocks in terms of reverse dfc and it seems to me that MercadoLibre is undervalued by about 50%.  They are still growing sales by more than 30% y/y and are improving their operating margin by increasing take rates and reducing costs.  They turn out outstanding results quarter after quarter and when faced with competitive threats from players such as Amazon and Shopee, they just keep coming out on top.  I have a somewhat focused portfolio of 9 stocks, but with the numbers I’m seeing, I just really want to put everything into MercadoLibre (not that I have a big portfolio - just around 30k)  Every other growth stock I evaluate seems either overvalued or reasonably valued, taking into account ten years of reasonable growth assumptions.  Take Nvidia for example.  I own Nvidia and based on my reverse DCF, if they can grow FCF by 30% for ten years, the stock is currently fairly valued.  I think they might be able to pull that off, so Nvidia might be worth owning.  But according to the same model, MercadoLibre only needs to grow FCF 11% annually over the next 10 years to justify their current valution.  This just seems like an absurdly low bar for them.  If my model is off, it would be off in the same direction for all the companies im evaluating.  Part of me thinks I should just invest in this one company that has both amazing fundamentals and low valuation.  Another part of me is just saying “hell no!  Always stay diversified!”  It’s like Cramer vs Munger in my head.  One voice says “5 stocks minimum”. The other says, “why buy anything but your best idea?”  Peter Lynch is also in my head.  I live in Mexico and use Mercado Libre’s services, so it’s a company I can get behind on a personal level.  I think Lynch would approve.  I’ve just never put all my money into one stock before, but this seems like an insane bargain.    What do you think?

In the week through Jan. 30, a ratio of bulls to bears identified in an Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers hit its highest since around mid-2021, months before stocks neared their prior peak, Yardeni Research analysis shows.*  *“There’s a ‘rah-rah’ mob mentality in the stock market, with some traders drunk on their own wine,” betting on Fed easing as soon as March and upwards of six cuts this year, said Nick Giacoumakis, president of NEIRG Wealth Management. “That’s totally unrealistic. If you keep buying Big Tech stocks at these levels, you’re asking for trouble.”*  *This month is off to a banner start, with the market wrapping up its 13th gain in 14 weeks. The S&P 500 hasn’t seen a streak like that since 1986.*  *Solid earnings from Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. drove the strength at the end of last week, after Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. released results that fell sort of investor expectations on AI.*  *February has a tendency to start on a high note, although the strength typically fades around mid-month as investors book profits, according to Jeffrey Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader’s Almanac. That’s particularly the case if stocks get a boost in January — like they often do — following tax-loss harvesting in December.*  *For the skittish camp, the latest signals from the Fed are a source of angst.*  *Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested last week that the central bank wasn’t about to lower rates anytime soon, and that was before Friday’s blockbuster jobs report. After that data, swaps traders chopped the probability of a March rate cut to around 20%, and no longer see a May reduction as a done deal.*  *For some would-be dip-buyers, that raises red flags, especially with the latest Deutsche Bank AG data showing that aggregate equity positioning among rules-based and discretionary funds is in the top quarter of observations going back to 2010. The bullish skew raises questions over who’s left to buy after fund managers piled into stocks at a furious pace in November, December and January.*  *“I really hope we get a correction in the stock market soon,” said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. “A selloff may not feel good at first, but I have a lot of money that I want to put to work for my clients.”*  *She plans to use any pullback to add shares of Palo Alto Networks Inc., Microsoft and Amazon.*  *At NEIRG Wealth, Giacoumakis said he owns megacap tech stocks, which have driven the bulk of the market’s advance over the past year, but he isn’t adding to his position due to lofty valuations.*  *Members of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies, the biggest firms in the S&P 500 — Apple Inc., Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. — carry a 33% premium to the index in terms of forward price-to-earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show.*  *Of course, sentiment can stay frothy for weeks — even months — before stocks suffer a significant drop, notes Hirsch at the Stock Trader’s Almanac, who correctly called the S&P 500’s double-digit rise in 2023.*  *Take 2021, he said: Back then, the ratio of bulls to bears in the Investors Intelligence survey was hovering at current levels for most of that year, while equities continued to rip higher.*  *“Stocks are ripe for a pullback soon, but nothing sinister,” said Hirsch, who sees the S&P 500 potentially topping 5,000 this month before retreating to its prior high near 4,800 — or a 4% drop.*  *“Market breadth is already lacking right now, with fewer stocks participating in this rally.”*";"41";"2024-02-09T19:49:32"

Revenue: $981 million vs. $991 million expected, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.  Earnings: 53 cents per share, adjusted, vs. 51 cents per share expected, according to LSEG.   Revenue rose 12% year-over-year from $877.2 million a year earlier, while net income was $201 million, or 29 cents a share, up from $17.49 million, or 3 cents a share, a year ago. it brought in the previous year.  Monthly active users in the fourth quarter rose 11% to 498 million, topping analyst estimates of 487 million. The company said its global average revenue per user was $2, lower than analyst estimates of $2.05.  Pinterest said first-quarter revenue will be between $690 million and $705 million, which equates to year-over-year growth of 15% to 17%. The middle of that range, $697.5 million, is below the average analyst estimate of $703 million.  Pinterest’s report comes as the broader digital advertising market is showing recovery, with Meta , Alphabet  and Amazon  all picking up steam and growing their ad business by double digits in the fourth quarter. The data suggests that businesses are boosting spending on online promotions after cutting back in 2022 and part of 2023 over concerns about the Ukraine-Russian war and high interest rates.  But not all online ad companies are seeing the benefits. Snap shares cratered 35% on Wednesday after the company reported fourth-quarter sales growth of 5%, trailing expectations, and the company also issued weak guidance.  Prior to Thursday’s report, Pinterest shares were up 9.5% this year after surging 53% in 2023.  Costs dropped about 10% from a year ago to $785 million, largely due to a decline in sales and marketing expenses. A year ago Pinterest slashed about 5% of its workforce, part of a mass waive of job cuts across the tech industry.

More ""co-exclusive"" deals coming.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15h8s5y/wbd_narrows_streaming_loss_thanks_to_3x_higher/";"The company’s DTC division reported $410 million in licensing revenue, more than triple last year’s sales, after offering shows like “Westworld” to rivals  Revenue from licensing HBO content buoyed Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming business in the second quarter, the company revealed in its earnings report Thursday. The sales helped significantly narrow its loss and appeared to be playing a big part in the company’s promise for its U.S. direct-t0-consumer business to turn a profit in 2023.  The media giant reported $2.73 billion in revenue in its DTC segment, which launched its Max service during the quarter. That was a 37% leap from last year’s second quarter, and represented about 26% of the company’s total revenue for the period. The segment swung to a $3 million EBITDA loss for the second quarter after reporting $50 million in positive EBITDA in the first quarter.  Content licensing revenue at $410 million revenue rose notably, more than tripling the $132 million reported in the same quarter last year, suggesting that the company would have had a far more significant loss without those fees.  The growth in licensing reflects a surprising move in recent months toward offering HBO shows like “Westworld” to free, ad-supported streaming TV services like Amazon’s Freevee and the Roku Channel. Warner Bros. Discovery also licensed HBO shows including “Insecure” to Netflix.  CEO David Zaslav said on a call with analysts Thursday that it would seek to do deals on a “co-exclusive” basis, meaning the licensed shows would also be available to Max subscribers.  Distribution revenue of $2.19 billion made up the bulk of the division’s total, including traditional HBO subscriptions, Max and HBO Max subscriptions, and Amazon Prime Video Channels revenue. Advertising revenue jumped 26% to $121 million, also mainly driven by subscriber growth. Total DTC subscribers fell by 1.8 million in the quarter to 95.8 million.  Zaslav told analysts the company’s deep content library “offers a wealth of opportunity in terms of feeding our own platforms, as well as others.”  “It’s a mainstay of our business to create great content and window width, through creating value in each window,” he said. “And as you would expect a lot of analysis and strategic discussion goes into these decisions. In some cases, we’ll want to keep premium content exclusively on our platform for a very long time. In other cases, we may sell it to third parties, and we don’t lose anything by growing the pie.”  “The fact is licensing some library content to others VOD platforms like Netflix or Amazon as part of a co-exclusive agreement is just smart business,” Zaslav said. “We’re expanding our audience, while maximizing the value of the asset and providing more revenue streams. And that is our job, to optimize the windowing to get the best possible return on investment.”  Warner Bros Discovery also inked deals with Roku and Tubi to license 2,000 hours of content and launch a series of channels in January. It also plans to introduce its own FAST service this year.  Later in the call, the CEO noted that if the Hollywood strikes continue, “there may be more demand” for WBD content.";"12";"2023-08-03T18:27:21"
"Farfetch Sold to South Korea’s Coupang";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18lqq4b/farfetch_sold_to_south_koreas_coupang/";">New York-listed e-commerce giant Coupang plans to buy Farfetch Holdings in a deal that will provide the struggling online luxury fashion retailer with $500 million in capital to stay in operation, the companies said in a joint statement. Trading in shares of Farfetch, which has a market capitalization of $226.7 million, were halted, while those of Coupang were down 4.5% on Monday.   >   >Farfetch, an e-commerce company that has helped luxury brands sell online, has been hit by a slowdown in the industry which has complicated its efforts to make a profit on technology investments and prompted credit rating downgrades in recent weeks. Farfetch operates an online luxury marketplace selling high-end fashion and jewelry that dozens of small brands and boutiques rely on as their main selling platform. It also provides back-end technology for ecommerce for department stores and brands like Harrods and Ferragamo.  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-south-koreas-coupang-buy-151417128.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-south-koreas-coupang-buy-151417128.html)  What a massive fall for Farfetch. The company was innovative, but its debt was a red flag, and its business model was confusing. Are they trying to be the Amazon of luxury fashion or the Shopify for luxury fashion, or both? Their acquisitions were confusing, heavily taking on inventory and operating physical stores like Browns and Stadium Goods.  This is an intriguing deal for Coupang. It will be interesting to see how much they liquidate Farfetch's assets. Are they primarily focused on Farfetch Platform Solutions powering the backend of fashion e-commerce or the digital marketplace and growing that brand?  It could be a great deal for Coupang or a distraction from their core business.  &#x200B:  &#x200B:";"57";"2023-12-19T03:24:52"
"Netflix to stream Christmas Day NFL games for three years ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1csmopv/netflix_to_stream_christmas_day_nfl_games_for/";"Netflix will stream Christmas Day NFL games for the next three years, in its first true step into live sports.  The streaming platform will show two games on Christmas Day this year, followed by at least one matchup in both 2025 and 2026, the league announced Wednesday.  It is unclear how much Netflix paid for the rights to stream the games.  Netflix has drawn large audiences with sports programming, from the “Formula 1: Drive to Survive” documentary to its “Quarterback” series following NFL signal callers. While the company took major strides into live programming with a deal to stream the WWE’s “Raw” and a boxing fight between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul, the company had suggested it had not found a live sports rights strategy that worked for it.  “We’ve not seen a profit path to renting big sports,” Co-Chief Executive Officer Ted Sarandos said in December 2022.  “We’re not anti-sports, we’re just pro-profit,” Sarandos said.  Now, Netflix will stream games for the most watched U.S. sports league, at a time when it is trying to boost profits by raising subscription prices, pushing users toward an ad-tier membership and cracking down on password sharing.  The three Christmas Day NFL games averaged 28.68 million viewers last year, according to Sports Media Watch.

It will start paying a dividend at 40 cents per share.  Here’s how the company did, compared with estimates from LSEG:  Earnings per share: $2.29, adjusted, vs. $2.26 expected  Revenue: $9.29 billion, vs. $9.22 billion expected  Salesforce’s revenue grew 10.8% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Jan. 31, according to a statement. The company reported net income of $1.45 billion, or $1.47 per share, compared with a loss of $98 million, or 10 cents per share.  During the quarter, Salesforce said it would acquire sales commission software startup Spiff for undisclosed terms and was starting to sell its products on the Amazon Web Services marketplace.  Salesforce called for adjusted fiscal first-quarter earnings of $2.37 to $2.39 per share, with $9.12 billion to $9.17 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had been expecting $2.20 in adjusted earnings per share on $9.15 billion in revenue.  For the new 2025 fiscal year, Salesforce said it sees adjusted earnings of $9.68 to $9.76 per share and $37.7 billion to $38.0 billion in revenue. The revenue figure implies 8.6% growth at the middle of the range. Analysts had expected $9.57 per share, along with $38.62 billion in revenue.

"Snap plunges 25% on revenue miss and light guidance, as Middle East conflict creates ‘headwind’";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1akkww1/snap_plunges_25_on_revenue_miss_and_light/";"Snap reported revenue that trailed analysts’ estimates on Tuesday and issued a forecast that came in a bit below Wall Street expectations. The stock plunged 20% in extended trading.  Here’s how the company did:  Earnings per share: 8 cents, adjusted, vs. 6 cents expected by analysts, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.  Revenue: $1.36 billion vs. $1.38 billion expected, according to LSEG.  Global Daily Active Users: 414 million vs. 412 million expected, according to StreetAccount.  Average revenue per user: $3.29 vs. $3.33 expected, according to StreetAccount.   Snap has struggled to rebound from the downturn in the digital ad market, and has now reported six straight quarters of single-digit growth or sales declines. For the fourth quarter, revenue rose about 5% year-over-year to $1.36 billion from $1.3 billion a year earlier.  For the second consecutive period, Snap attributed some of the weakness to the war in the Middle East, which erupted in October beginning with Hamas’s attack on Israel.  “While we are encouraged by the progress we are making with our ad platform and the improved results we are delivering for many of our advertising partners, we estimate that the onset of the conflict in the Middle East was a headwind to year-over-year growth of approximately 2 percentage points in Q4,” Snap said in a letter to investors.  Growth is expected to accelerate in the first quarter, but not quite as fast as analysts were expecting. Snap forecast sales for the quarter of $1.095 billion to $1.135 billion, representing about 11% growth at the midpoint of the range, which was $1.115 billion. Analysts were looking for revenue of $1.117 billion.  Daily active users for the first quarter will be 420 million, Snap said, slightly topping analyst estimates of 419.3 million.  Earlier this week, Snap said it would cut 10% of its global workforce, which equates to about 500 employees. A company spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that the cuts were intended to reorganize staff and “reduce hierarchy and promote in-person collaboration.” In mid-2022, Snap eliminated about 1,000 employees, or 20% of its fulltime workforce.  Snap’s net loss for the quarter narrowed to $248.2 million, or 15 cents a share, which represents a 14% year-over-year decrease from $288.5 million, or 18 cents a share.  Snap said it expects an adjusted EBITDA loss between $55 million to $95 million in the first quarter, higher than analyst projections of $21.9 million. Last quarter, Snap issued an “internal forecast” for the fourth quarter instead of providing official guidance because of “the unpredictable nature of war,” referring to the Israel-Hamas war.  Snap on Tuesday disclosed sales its its Snapchat+ subscription service for the first time and said it had an annualized revenue run rate of $249 million in 2023. The service now has 7 million subscribers, up from five million in the previous quarter. Snap introduced the product in 2022, pitching it as a way for users to access early features. It came debuted that summer for $3.99 a month.  Snap’s growth in the fourth quarter lagged larger digital ad rivals like Meta, Amazon and Alphabet, which all reported double-digit expansion in their advertising units.  Snap and Pinterest are “much smaller companies that have struggled to build substantial ad businesses, Debra Aho Williamson, an industry analyst, told CNBC. “In this environment, the big are getting bigger,”  Last week, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel attended a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on child safety and technology alongside Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,  X CEO Linda Yaccarino, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and Discord CEO Jason Citron. Lawmakers grilled the executives, accusing them of failing to properly safeguard their respective platforms from child predators, among other concerns.

"Google parent Alphabet’s stock hit with two downgrades this week";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14l5hf7/google_parent_alphabets_stock_hit_with_two/";"In his research note, Shmulik said Alphabet’s “narrative has caught up with the fundamentals.” In other words, the stock is priced to match the company’s current performance and outlook. He also raised concerns about the way market sentiment went negative on the company after OpenAI announced ChatGPT in Nov. 2022 only to turn positive when the tech titan debuted its own generative AI software in May.      “What do we imagine would happen then, in any of the next 2-4 quarters, if Google Search numbers were to come in 'soft'? We imagine investors may once again ring the alarm bells around AI-related risks to Google's Search moat,” Shmulik wrote.  The analysts also pointed to Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) as a potential headwind for the company’s search advertising business. SGE is Google’s experimental generative AI-powered search platform. Like Microsoft’s Bing, it uses generative AI to provide users with answers to specific queries. The problem, the analysts say, is that the generative AI responses occupy screen space that is currently used to serve ads on the normal Google Search page.  “We recognize that \[Google’s\] SGE roll-out is still in its very early stages (limited beta in the US only), with the integration of ads still being figured out,” Walmsley wrote in a research note. “But our initial testing of SGE shows material changes to \[search engine results page\] vs. the ‘old’ Google…which we see as demonstrative of the potential disruption to Google's well-oiled Search monetization machine.”      Google is also increasingly facing challenges from the likes of Meta and Amazon in the digital advertising space. TikTok is also quickly playing a larger role in the industry. Increased spending on generative AI technologies could also cut into Alphabet’s margins.      The company is also staring down a slew of regulatory challenges including calls by the European Union’s European Commission to break up Google’s massive advertising business, which the commission says violates antitrust laws.";"94";"2023-06-28T12:09:27"

"Fallen post IPO stocks, which may have hidden gems potential";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1583mbq/fallen_post_ipo_stocks_which_may_have_hidden_gems/";"Some analysis from my site of new and innovative companies, which received massive media attention and hype in the last years. But after hype is gone, many of these stocks has significantly fallen in their prices, especially those that went public in the last two to three years. Nevertheless, in my opinios we have some hidden gems here, which may be worth a look at right now:  **Bumble: A Bumpy Ride for the Dating App Giant**  Bumble, a well-known dating app with additional features, has experienced a significant 77% decline in its stock since its IPO. While its revenue growth has been solid but not outstanding, with a 16% increase in the last quarter, the company's profitability has seen a slight decline but has shown signs of improvement. With a market capitalization of $2.3 billion and a price-to-sales ratio of around 2.5, the current valuation appears attractive, presenting a potential buying opportunity after the initial hype during the IPO was considered unjustified. Investors may find Bumble worth a second look given the current lack of interest in the stock.  **Rivian: The ""Tesla Killer"" Faces Tough Competition**  Rivien, known as the ""Tesla Killer,"" has gathered significant media attention for its electric vehicles, especially pickup trucks and SUVs with unique headlights. Despite the initial hype, the stock has plummeted by 88% since its IPO. Ford and Amazon were major investors, but the relationship with Amazon soured, leading Rivien to terminate its exclusive supply contract.  As a young company, Rivien's latest quarterly numbers show impressive revenue growth of 600%, primarily due to minimal revenue in the previous year. The company is now delivering significant quantities of cars, totaling 8,000 in the current quarter, and aims to achieve a gross profit in 2024 while targeting over 50,000 vehicle deliveries in 2023. With a cash cushion of nearly $12 billion, Rivien's market capitalization stands at $14.2 billion.  Considering the current revenue growth, Rivien's value seems attractive, but it's crucial to acknowledge the uncertainty surrounding its future. The revenue-to-sales ratio is not representative at this stage. Investors who believe in Rivien as a serious automaker may find the company's valuation worthy of respect. However, the stock remains speculative due to ongoing uncertainties and market speculation.  **Didi: The Struggles of a Ride-Hailing Giant in China**  Didi, a ride-hailing company with food delivery services, has experienced an 80% decline in stock value since its IPO. Revenue growth has been inconsistent due to COVID-19 impact and regulatory challenges in China. Despite a recent data scandal and a $1.2 billion fine, Didi's market capitalization is $14.5 billion, less than one times its revenue of $19 billion. A potential China comeback may make the stock appealing, but it carries increased risk.  **Marqeta: A Hidden Gem in the Fintech Industry**  Marqeta, a fintech company serving the B2B sector with payment and card solutions, has seen an 84% decline in stock value since its IPO. Revenue growth has been impressive, with a 31% increase in the last quarter, leading to improved profitability. Currently, Marqeta's market capitalization stands at $2.6 billion, with revenue reaching $800 million, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of approximately 3.3. Considering the strong 30% growth, the current valuation appears exciting and remarkably inexpensive. However, the stock was evidently overvalued at its IPO, given its current financial performance.  **Palantir: The Profitability Puzzle**  Palantir, a well-known data analysis software firm, has seen a 66% increase in its stock since IPO, achieving near profitability in the last two quarters. While revenue growth was solid at 18%, the market capitalization stands at $33 billion, 17 times its revenue of $2 billion. This valuation is deemed very high, considering moderate profitability and an 18% growth rate.  **Coupang: The South Korean Amazon**  Coupang, a dominant player in South Korea's 24-hour delivery and e-commerce market, has seen a 60% decline in stock value since IPO. Despite stable growth and a 20% currency-adjusted growth rate in the latest quarter, profitability has surged by 36%, with a positive EBITDA of $241 million. With a market capitalization of $31 billion and revenue of $21 billion, the stock's current valuation is just 1.5 times its revenue, making it an attractive deal. Considering a potential strong comeback in South Korea, the stock deserves a second look.  **Snowflake: A Hyped Cloud-Based Software Service**  Snowflake, a cloud-based software service company, is shaping the market and expects exponential growth. Despite a 25% decline since IPO, its latest quarterly numbers were strong, with a 47% revenue increase and positive earnings per share. The net revenue retention remains high at 151%, but a downward trend is evident. With a market capitalization of $55 billion and revenue of $2.2 billion, the stock's current valuation is 25 times its revenue, considered astronomically high. The hype surrounding Snowflake's partnerships with Microsoft and Nvidia attracts investors, but caution is advised as market interest may eventually calm down.  **Coinbase: Riding the Cr\*ptocurrency Rollercoaster**  Coinbase, a cryptocurrency platform, experienced a significant decline since its IPO, currently standing at -76% from the offering price. The decreasing interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, has impacted Coinbase's trading volume and revenue, which almost halved since the beginning of 2022. Despite managing to improve profitability, Coinbase still operates at a negative margin. The current market capitalization is $17 billion with revenue of $2.8 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of over 6, which isn't considered cheap. As the market largely depends on the price of B\*tcoin and cr\*pto trading volume, Coinbase is viewed as a speculative investment, and direct investment in Bitcoin might yield better results, especially during downward phases.  **GitLab: A Promising Business Model**  GitLab, a DevOps platform solution, has experienced a decline of 56% since its IPO. Despite this, the company's business development has been promising, with pleasing revenue and profitability trends. GitLab follows a software-as-a-service subscription model, charging per user per month. The current market capitalization is $7 billion with revenue of $460 million, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of approximately 15. While the numbers are good, the high valuation may not be fully justified yet. However, the positive business trajectory indicates potential for further stock growth.  **DoorDash: Strong Growth with Uncertain Profitability**  DoorDash, a food delivery service, has experienced a decline of 56% since its IPO. Despite this, the company has shown strong revenue growth, averaging around 40% in recent quarters, and provided a slight surprise in earnings per share. The current market capitalization is $29 billion with revenue of $7.1 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of 4. However, DoorDash is yet to achieve profitability, and the path to break-even remains unclear. Although restaurant food prices have increased by around 25%, DoorDash still faces challenges in reaching profitability. As such, investors may be cautious until a clear path to profitability emerges.  **Roblox: Targeting a Young Audience**  Roblox, an online game platform targeting a young audience, has seen a 42% decline in its stock since its IPO. Revenue growth has been stagnant, influenced by pandemic effects, and losses have significantly widened, reaching approximately $270 million per quarter. Despite this, Roblox has a high market valuation of $23 billion with revenue of $2.3 billion, resulting in a stock price ten times higher than its revenue. This valuation is considered expensive, especially considering the increased losses and minimal growth, as the company relies on the purchasing power of parents of its young target audience. As a result, investors may view Roblox as a risky investment at its current valuation.  **UiPath: Robotics in Process Automation**  UiPath, a company specializing in robotic process automation (RPA), has seen a significant decline of nearly 74% in its stock since its IPO. However, its revenue has almost doubled since going public, and the retention rate remains high at 22%. The latest quarterly numbers were positive, with growth and earnings per share surpassing expectations. Currently, UiPath's market capitalization is just under $10 billion with revenue of $1.1 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of 8.6, which is not considered cheap. UiPath faces competition from other players like Microsoft in the RPA and process automation space, which adds to the competitive landscape. While the company's financial performance shows promise, investors may be cautious about its valuation and the competitive challenges it faces.  **Toast: A Savory Deal for Restaurant Operators**  Toast, a specialized software solution for the restaurant sector, has experienced a decline of -60% in its stock value since its IPO. However, the company's financials show positive signs. It has achieved steady growth with a robust 53% revenue increase in the first quarter of 2023. The revenue sources include hardware sales, subscription model fees, and other channels for restaurant operators. Toast's profitability has also improved significantly, with the negative adjusted EBITDA nearly halving in recent quarters. Currently, the stock has a market capitalization of $11 billion with revenue of $3 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of 4, which is considered an attractive valuation given the current growth rate. The company's ingenious business model that covers various aspects of the restaurant business makes it promising for potential investors despite its recent stock decline.  **Affirm: Stagnation in the ""Buy Now, Pay Later"" Space**  Affirm, a fintech company providing ""buy now, pay later"" solutions to online retailers, has experienced a 57% decline in its stock value since its mid-2021 IPO. The company's revenue has remained relatively stagnant in recent quarters, with no significant growth. Similar trends are observed with competitors like Mollie, Afterpay, and Zip, indicating a stagnant market. Due to the lack of growth and increasing profits, the current valuation is deemed too expensive, and the stock does not present many investment opportunities.  &#x200B:  **Summary**  In conclusion, this analysis highlights the rollercoaster ride of IPO hype, with some stocks failing to fullfill the expectations, while others offer hidden gems potential. For me personaly: Toast and Coupang stand out as promising stocks with strong financials. Let me know your thoughts on this summary and your personal ""hidden gems"".  &#x200B:  And of course as always: This is not a financial advice and im not a financial advisor.

"What Walmart’s ($WMT) stock split means for the Dow Jones.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1amq4ap/what_walmarts_wmt_stock_split_means_for_the_dow/";"Walmart recently announced a 3 for 1 stock split, a significant move considering its status as a major component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Since the Dow is a price-weighted index, this split will decrease Walmart’s weighting in the index, initiating a rebalance to accommodate the drop in price.  It's intriguing to note that the Dow has been trailing behind the S&P 500 in performance YTD, increasing ~2.6% and ~5.4% respectively.   Potentially prompting the index to consider adding new stocks to compensate for the YTD underperformance.  The last time the Dow underwent a significant change was in August 2020. At that time, Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell were added, while Exxon, Pfizer, and RTX Corp were removed.  Unlike their usual practices, the Dow committee has delayed making changes for an extended period of time, reminiscent of the period from June 2009 to September 2012.  With the Dow undergoing rebalancing, I’m eyeing potential exits for IBM, Cisco, Intel, Verizon, and Walgreens Boots Alliance.    Additionally, I could see potential additions like Amazon, META, and Eli Lilly who have a wider touch on the economy.  Which stocks do you predict might be on the way out, and which new additions do you foresee?";"31";"2024-02-09T16:03:06"

Apologies if the title does not fit quite right. My thoughts are for every Microsoft there are a number of other software companies that did not make it big yet seemed to be poised to lead the pack. For every Amazon, there are other e-commmerce companies which might have been equally as good if not better that didn't make it.   Here I do not mean the companies that didn't necessarily make sense (selling the ability to send scents over the Internet or beanie babies that were hyped by a bubble).

"Microsoft earnings are out – here are the numbers";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/159jfo6/microsoft_earnings_are_out_here_are_the_numbers/";"Microsoft reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.  Here are the key numbers to follow:  Earnings: $2.69 a share. That may not compare with the $2.55 cents per share expected by Refinitiv.  Revenue:  $56.19 billion. That may not compare with the $55.47 billion expected by Refinitiv.  Based on analysts’ projections, Microsoft will close fiscal 2023 with revenue growth below 10% for the first time since 2017. Growth for the latest quarter is expected to come in at around 7%. Businesses have been delaying cloud and software deployments since last year due to economic uncertainty and the potential for higher interest rates.  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees in May that the company won’t lift salaries this year.  Analysts polled by CNBC and by StreetAccount expect Microsoft to report about 25% year-over-year growth in revenue from the Azure public cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Microsoft doesn’t report Azure revenue in dollars. The projected growth rate is similar to what analysts expect from Google’s cloud division. Parent company Alphabet also reports results after the bell on Tuesday.  During the quarter, Microsoft built on its broad alliance with OpenAI to capitalize on fresh interest in artificial intelligence, following the November launch of the startup’s ChatGPT chatbot. Microsoft introduced a chatbot powered partly by OpenAI language models to help workers make sense of their employers’ data, and it told developers they’ll be able to build plugins that people can access through ChatGPT, the Bing search engine’s chatbot, and other tools.  Investors are eager for resolution in Microsoft’s arrangement to buy Activision Blizzard for almost $69 billion, which was agreed upon in January 2022. Earlier this month, an appeals court denied the Federal Trade Commission’s motion to stop the transaction. Activision shares have climbed past $92.50, close to the $95 that Microsoft agreed to pay, reflecting optimism that the deal is on track to close.  Microsoft shares have gained 44% year to date, while the S&P 500 is up 19%.  In June, Microsoft said it expected to take a $425 million charge in the quarter to pay a fine from Ireland’s Data Protection Commission after the authority looked at whether the company’s LinkedIn unit violated the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.  Executives will discuss the quarterly results with analysts and issue guidance on a conference call starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.
