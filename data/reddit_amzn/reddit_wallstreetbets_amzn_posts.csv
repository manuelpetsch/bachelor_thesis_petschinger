"The downfall of Amazon $AMZN has started.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1b8a3n8/the_downfall_of_amazon_amzn_has_started/";"Investors and consumers need to know this very important fact about Amazon (Marketplace). They just dug their own grave. Third party sellers make up about 65% of the sales generated on Amazon and recently they did a dirty move to third sellers that will have many leaving the platform or raising prices so high that Amazon becomes uncompetitive to consumers. Amazon just announced/implemented two new double-dip fees that will crush third party sellers and that's not even an exaggeration.  The first fee which has been implemented already is an ""inbound placement fee"" which is a shipping fee Amazon tacks on to send inventory to Amazon ""Prime"" for Amazon FBA (fulfilled by Amazon). This fee has increased the shipping cost for third party sellers by 6-10x. For example, a seller sending a truckload of inventory (prior to this inbound placement fee) to Amazon traditionally spent about $600-$800, sometimes way more. Now on top of this they are charged with the inbound placement fee of about $3,000-$5,000. This essentially wipes out a huge chunk, if not most, of the profit margin for a seller on Amazon. Add in the additional fees Amazon charges: 15% referral fee (just to list on their site), 8-15% fulfillment fee (FBA: picking, packing and delivery), storage fees (around $0.78 per cubic foot) and advertising costs (about 2-15% of the price of each good depending on the market).  The second fee which will take place in about a month is a ""low inventory fee"" which is a fee imposed by the Amazon algorithm when inventory is starting to run low at Amazon fulfillment centers. This fee can be anywhere from $0.32-$1.11 PER ITEM. The kicker is that the Amazon fulfillment center receiving process is a huge cluster fuck that can take 30+ days to inbound and check-in from when the Seller ships it. That is, if Amazon doesn't lose or damage the goods at the warehouse OR during delivery.  So by the time Amazon ships a product out to a customer, they have essentially pocketed about 60% of the sale. When you take out the cost of the good for the seller, that leaves them with very little profit margin, if any. The margins were already razor thin before these rate hikes and now they are all but gone.  Why is this important to investors and customers? The only solution for third party sellers to barely keep their head above the water and maintain a remote semblance of their razor thin margins prior to the new fees is to raise prices. I'm talking 20-30% price increases are required at a minimum just to get back to par. You want to talk about all the issues with inflation well, now you know, corporate greed is being shown at its finest. Amazon reported a $30.4 billion net income for 2023 but will penny pinch third party sellers even more at the expense of driving prices up for consumers like never before seen on the platform. This will cause consumers to look elsewhere to shop other than Amazon because Amazon will now be highly uncompetitive. It's just a matter of time. Amazon shot themselves in the foot and needs to reverse course on these absurd fees.  PUTS ON $AMZN  [ADD] Wow this post blew up! While I have your attention, remember when you get a damaged or wrong product from Amazon, don’t go leaving a 1-star negative review because that just screws over the seller who had nothing to do with the transaction. It’s 100% Amazon’s fault and leaving a negative review is a shit thing to do. Contact customer service instead and yell at them. On that note, if a seller reaches out and makes things right, leave a good review or edit the bad review you left. The good Sellers work hard for their reviews and you shouldn’t shit on them for Amazon’s mistakes.";"4023";"2024-03-06T21:21:00"

The company will trim “a few hundred roles” in the team that overlooks technology for physical stores, a move that comes just a day after Amazon said it was ditching Just Walk Out technology in its U.S. grocery stores.  In addition to the physical stores technology team, Amazon said it’s cutting “several hundred roles” in the AWS sales, marketing and global service organization. Most of those cuts are related to business changes in AWS training and certification programs as well as sales operations.

"Your Next Amazon Order Might Be Delivered Without A Box";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/15rr6gv/your_next_amazon_order_might_be_delivered_without/";"Amazon is set to change how it delivers products, skipping the extra Amazon box for certain items like TVs and toasters. This move is part of CEO Andy Jassy's strategy to boost profits and reduce waste. Around 11% of items already arrive without extra packaging, and Amazon aims to expand this approach to cut costs and promote sustainability. While there are potential risks like theft due to visible packaging, the benefits in terms of efficiency and reduced environmental impact are significant. Other companies like Brita have already redesigned packaging to align with Amazon's program, signaling a positive industry shift. This change aligns with Jassy's vision for a more profitable and eco-friendly Amazon.  **Target & Starbucks Genius Strategy**  Target has unveiled a new nationwide initiative – free curbside delivery of Starbucks orders – catering to the younger generation's penchant for mobile ordering. Customers using Target's Drive Up service can now seamlessly add Starbucks purchases to their order. This collaboration aligns with Starbucks' strategy to enhance customer experience through digital convenience, resonating with the growing Gen Z and Millennial customer base. Starbucks reported a 12% revenue boost in Q3 2023, reaching a record $9.2 billion, with its mobile app usage surging by 12.4% last year. The Starbucks-Target partnership is set to enhance convenience for busy parents, and the service will be available in 1,700+ stores with Starbucks Cafés and Drive Up service by October.  **The Saga Continues: Barbie and Oppenheimer Box Office Dominance**  Barbie and Oppenheimer dominated the weekend box office, securing the top two spots and raking in $33.7 million and $18.8 million respectively, as reported by the Hollywood Reporter. Barbie's performance propelled it into the list of top 10 films with the biggest fourth weekends in history, pushing its domestic earnings to a whopping $526.3 million.  Oppenheimer followed closely, claiming the second spot and adding to its success with a total domestic pull of $264 million and a global box office tally of $649 million. This makes it director Christopher Nolan's fifth-highest grossing film, trailing only The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk.  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem secured $15.8 million, while Meg 2: The Trench slipped to fourth place, amassing a total domestic earning of $54.1 million after a $12.7 million weekend.  A new entry, Last Voyage of Demeter, the Dracula film with a $45 million budget, debuted with $6.5 million. Disney’s Haunted Mansion earned $5.6 million and claimed sixth place, premiering just after the start of the actor's strike.  **Hershey Steps Up as Health-Conscious Consumers Seek Wellness in Snacks**  Hershey introduced its better-for-you confection (BFY) strategy in 2021, aiming to expand options for health-conscious snackers. This includes no sugar added, zero-sugar, plant-based, and protein-packed products. The move was influenced by consumer insights revealing a growing focus on wellness:  \- 71% prioritize a healthy lifestyle  \- 78% see healthy eating as crucial  \- 70% aim to reduce sugar intake  \- 62% look to add protein to their diet  Hershey caters to these trends through various initiatives:  1. **Sugar Management:** They revamped the Zero Sugar line, experiencing tripled sales. They acquired Lily's, known for no-added sugar treats, and launched Honest Organic Gummies.  2. **Plant-Based Options:** The company tapped into the booming vegan chocolate market with Hershey’s Plant Based Extra Creamy with Almonds & Sea Salt and Reese’s Plant Based Peanut Butter Cups.  3. **Protein Occasions:** Addressing the demand for protein, they acquired ONE™ Brands and are launching protein-packed ONE™ Puffs.  Hershey collaborates with retailers to capitalize on the BFY trend, placing products strategically and utilizing eye-catching displays. BFY confection's growth potential is high, offering consumers more choices for various occasions. The success of this strategy stems from consumer insights, market awareness, and strategic partnerships.  Edit: Seems like the community enjoy this type of information.

"Google, Amazon, and Unity are among the tech companies implementing layoffs to start 2024";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/196i3fc/google_amazon_and_unity_are_among_the_tech/";"Google, Amazon, and Unity are among the tech companies implementing layoffs to start 2024, echoing trends observed in 2023. Tech firms persist in cost-cutting, efficiency improvement, and adapting to a cooling labor market. The U.S. unemployment rate stands at 3.7%, a near 50-year low, yet recent months have seen a slowdown in job gains. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employers added 105,000 workers in October, 173,000 in November, and 216,000 in December, below the 2023 monthly average of 225,000.   Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) confirmed on Thursday that it is laying off hundreds of staff across its voice assistant, hardware, and engineering teams. A Google spokesperson mentioned organizational changes, including role eliminations globally, aligning with product priorities.  Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman are reportedly leaving the company after Google's $2.1B acquisition in 2021, amidst competition with the Apple (AAPL) Watch. Alphabet also made several cuts in 2023, including an announcement in January to eliminate roughly 12,000 jobs.  Unity Software (NYSE:U) announced a 25% staff cut this week, aiming to restructure and refocus its core business for long-term and profitable growth. Approximately 1,800 employees are impacted, with the company unable to reasonably estimate costs associated with the reduction until the first quarter of 2024. Despite revenue growth, Unity has struggled to turn a profit, leading to a 20% decline in shares over the past six months.  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to cut several hundred employees in its media units, including Prime Video and MGM Studios. Reports suggest a 35% reduction in the Twitch workforce, affecting around 500 workers, and a 5% cut in the Audible workforce. Like tech counterpart Alphabet, Amazon made various employment cuts in the previous year.  Xerox (NASDAQ:XRX) announced a 15% reduction in its workforce in the first quarter of this year as part of a restructuring plan. The plan focuses on improving and stabilizing the core print business, increasing productivity through a new Global Business Services organization, and directing Digital Services and IT Services capabilities towards more profitable markets. This restructuring follows a 6% year-over-year decline in third-quarter sales.";"328";"2024-01-14T16:16:45"
"Amazon Earnings: The Boomer Play that Could Print 🚀💰";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17h0sy7/amazon_earnings_the_boomer_play_that_could_print/";"Alright, buckle up degenerates, here comes Amazon's earnings rollercoaster. Is this the meme stock of the month? Nah, but it could be the boomer play that prints. Let's break it down. 🚀 Amazon is set to report earnings today, the company's had massive earnings growth this year, beating EPS estimates by 44% and 89% in the last two quarters, respectively. Today, the quarterly earnings are expected to come in at an EPS of $0.60 on $141.5 billion in revenue. $127.1 billion the previous year.  Jeff Bezos might've shot himself into space, but his money-making behemoth stays grounded on Earth. The company is doing well with amazon shares are up 42% this year, topping the Nasdaq’s 23% gain. So, the big question: YOLO some calls for earnings or nah? After Amazon’s growth slowed dramatically last year due to rising inflation and economic concerns, expansion has ticked up a bit in 2022, though it’s still weaker than usual for the company. Amazon’s retail business is expected to show some improvement from consumers tepidly resuming discretionary spending.   Analysts are expecting growth of 11% in the third quarter, marking a slight acceleration from the past couple quarters. E-commerce sales boomed during the pandemic, then slowed as shoppers returned to physical stores. I'll be focused on the results of Amazon's Prime Big Deals Days event, as well as guidance for consumer spending during the holidays.  **Cloud Computing**  Being the world's largest cloud provider and a significant profit driver for amazon (nearly 70%), all eyes will be on Amazon Web Services (AWS).   Amazon’s cloud computing business is a concern for a lot of people in wall street, as growth in AWS has been slowing in recent quarters. Google just reported earnings and one of its misses was in the cloud revenue department—could this mean that AWS is taking more of the lion's share. However, you'd think the frenzy around generative artificial intelligence is leading to bigger workloads in the cloud, which should be a boon for AWS and its rival public cloud vendors. Looking at Microsoft (MSFT), sales in their Azure cloud unit grew 29%, faster than the 26% expected by analysts. This is considered bitter sweet as this could be eating into AWS' market share.   I expect stable AWS revenue, but want to know more about higher energy costs and rising competition. They currently hold a 40% share of the cloud services market last year, compared to Microsoft's 21.5% and Google's 7.5%.  **Ads**  Let's talk ads. Amazon's ad sales are right up there with Alphabet (GOOG) and Meta (META), so it will be interesting to see how it fared this quarter. One of Amazon's fastest-growing business sectors. Alphabet beat ad-sales estimates by almost $1 billion this quarter and Amazon will look to report similar success.  **AI**  Microsoft has OpenAI, we all know this. Amazon wanted in on the AI space and and in Sept announcing a deal to invest up to $4 billion in OpenAI competitor Anthropic. Additionally, in April, Amazon launched Amazon Bedrock, a service that allows users of Amazon's AWS to create generative AI applications. During the earnings call, I'm interested in hearing if there are any gains from its AI efforts. As mentioned earlier, the rise in AI causes more people to use cloud computing services like AWS.   **What do the experts say?**  BofA Global Research analyst Justin Post mentioned stuff that I've already written up here in a research note, stating that AWS is the Street’s top focus area, with some third-party sources suggesting that demand has decelerated. He's specifically betting on 12.5% growth for AWS, but cautions that a number in the 11% range would likely trigger selling. But further ads that a number above 13% would likely spur the stock higher.  On top of this, Post says aggregated credit and debit card data suggests online spending rose 1% from a year ago in the quarter, a two point acceleration from the June quarter. And he notes that “ad spending checks were also constructive.”  “We see retail upside potential driven by logistics efficiency, ads, fee increases, and easing comps,” Post writes “while we think AWS can accelerate in Q4 with more acceleration in Q1 2024 on an easing optimization cycle and incremental AI demand.” Post keeps his Buy rating and $174 target price on the stock. Mind you, the stock is literally at $118 right now.   **What to do for earnings**  My magic 8-ball says both revenue and EPS could outpace the estimates. Alright Degens, here's the play: I'm grabbing some AMZN 10/27 125c @ 2.04 each.  If Amazon rockets just 7%, those calls are hitting pay dirt. 🚀  Get your war paint on, it’s earnings season. 🎰🔥";"94";"2023-10-26T18:45:48"

I gross annually between $1-2mil in revenue. At first many sellers and I kind of brushed off this new policy change that was initiated on March 1st, 2024. However once digging deeper into it and making shipments to send into Amazon, I realized how much of a vulture Amazon truly is. As much as I absolutely hate these changes, and I hope FTC investigates the shit out of them, this is extremely bullish for Amazon's cashflow perspective.  [https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/headlines.html?id=GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5&ref=nslp\_at\_33\_GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5\_en-US\_ttl\_rf\_recent\_news\_34](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/headlines.html?id=GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5&ref=nslp_at_33_GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5_en-US_ttl_rf_recent_news_34)[https://www.ecomcrew.com/amazon-fba-big-fee-increase-2024/](https://www.ecomcrew.com/amazon-fba-big-fee-increase-2024/)  **Analysis:**  Amazon's recent strategic adjustments are poised to enhance its profitability significantly through the expansion of the Amazon Global Logistics Program and modifications to its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) policies. Here's a breakdown of why these changes will benefit Amazon financially:  **Expansion of Amazon Global Logistics Program:**\- What it is: Amazon Global Logistics is a comprehensive shipping and logistics service that facilitates international shipping for sellers on Amazon's platform. It handles cargo from the point of origin to Amazon warehouses worldwide, including sea, air, and land transportation.  \- Impact: Given that 60-70% of Amazon's third-party sellers are from China, and a substantial portion of private label goods on Amazon are imported from China, the expansion of this program positions Amazon as a key logistics provider for international sellers. By handling sea shipping directly, Amazon eliminates the need to pay third-party shipping companies, thus capturing more revenue from the logistics and shipping process.  ""**Voluntary"" Use of Amazon Warehouse Distribution (AWD) for FBA Sellers:**\- What it is: Amazon's policy now encourages third-party FBA sellers to use its Amazon Warehouse Distribution system, compelling them to store inventory in Amazon's warehouses, which incurs storage fees, inbound fees, and other charges. Amazon will then automatically distribute its inventory to FBA warehouses as it deem fit.  \- Impact: This move ensures a consistent revenue stream from storage and handling fees paid by sellers. Additionally, sellers are faced with significant penalties for not using AWD, such as high inventory placement fees or the logistical burden of distributing inventory across multiple locations in the USA. (Before this, sellers can usually send all its inventory to one warehouse to save on cost, but that's no longer the case). This strategy not only generates more revenue from fees but also reduces Amazon's costs by shifting the inventory distribution burden to sellers. The average inventory placement cost per box will be about $25-$50. This is absolutely ridiculous.  **Implementation of Extra Fulfillment Fees for Low Inventory:**  \- What it is: Amazon has introduced an additional fulfillment fee for sellers who maintain less than 28 days of inventory in Amazon's warehouses. This fee, a minimum of $0.89 per unit, penalizes sellers for not keeping a sufficient stock, especially for high-demand items.  \- Impact: This policy directly impacts sellers' profit margins, especially for those selling products at lower price points. For example, a $9.99 item with a profit margin of $2, selling 10,000 units a month, this extra charge significantly eats into profits. The intent behind keeping inventory levels lean—to avoid excessive storage fees—now results in additional costs through fulfillment fees.  This policy effectively forces sellers to either risk running low on inventory and incurring extra fees or overstock to avoid these penalties, leading to higher storage fees. What's even more fucked up about it is that Amazon fulfillment centers usually checks in our shipments late. This means that if I have shipment that was delivered to Amazon Warehouse (Say enough inventory to cover 40 days) but not checked in, and I only have 30 days of inventory left, now I will have to pay extra fee because of ""low inventory"" even though it takes forever for Amazon to process your inventory. I have multiple shipments that's been delivered for about 3 weeks now, and they are still not checked in.  \- Strategic Benefit for Amazon: By charging extra for fulfillment when inventory levels fall below a certain threshold, Amazon not only generates additional revenue but also pressures sellers to maintain higher inventory levels, thereby increasing the use of Amazon's storage facilities. This policy, combined with the ""voluntary"" use of Amazon's Inventory Placement service for restocking, which incurs additional fees, further ties sellers into Amazon's logistics ecosystem. It incentivizes the use of Amazon's AWD system, underlining Amazon's strategy to centralize control over logistics and distribution, enhancing its revenue streams from logistical and warehousing services while also potentially reducing operational complexities and costs.  \*\*Overall Financial Impact:\*\*These backend changes significantly reduce operational costs for Amazon by streamlining logistics and warehouse operations. Simultaneously, they increase revenue through logistics services, storage, and handling fees. By centralizing control over logistics and storage, Amazon not only saves on the costs of dealing with external logistics providers but also capitalizes on the fees charged to sellers. This dual approach of cutting costs and boosting revenue streams is poised to enhance Amazon's profitability in the competitive e-commerce and logistics sectors.  Again, I hope Lina Khan investigates the shit out of Amazon for using this bullshit tactic, but it is what it is. This is going to be extremely bullish for Amazon as it cuts costs while strengthen its global logistics empire.  Bonus: Amazon Advertising is also a bunch of bullshit (In terms of as a gigantic cash cow for them). The suggested bids for keywords are usually 2x higher than the actual bid needed to get top spots. This makes uninformed sellers spend a crap on advertising everyday. Just for perspective, I have about 12 products in my private label brand, and I spend on average $300-$500 a day. YES EVERY SINGLE DAY. That's about $110k to $190k a year just in ads. This is extremely high margin business for Amazon because they don't have to do anything. In addition, by Amazon running Ads on most prime video accounts, they will make on average $10/month per user. They also signed deals with NFL to exclusively stream their games. As much as I hate them, the future for Amazon is only up.  Extra bonus: Amazon already handles majority of packages in the US. By a click of a button, they can easily start taking marketshare from both UPS and Fedex by offering shipping to everyday people. They can utilize their wholefoods or kohl's location to receive and ship packages. Or they could also offer franchise opportunities to mom-pop shipping/packaging stores just like how UPS and Fedex has it.  Position: 20% of my portfolio is now in AMZN. Even at ATH, I plan to change to 50% weighted in Amazon... This is pissing me off, but I gotta find a way to get my money back somehow.";"221";"2024-03-04T00:16:49"
"Apple, Amazon and Coinbase Earnings Today";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/15hdkrl/apple_amazon_and_coinbase_earnings_today/";"Today we have a pretty massive line up with earnings, and I wanted to offer my 2 cents for those looking to play either Apple or Amazon  **Apple**  Let's start with AAPL. Apple’s stock is up over 51% so far in 2023, hitting all-time highs. I honestly see it as a safe haven with strong cash flow, even tho investors have been worrying about slowing demand for consumer goods, including PCs and smartphones. During the call, I'll want to hear about how the current quarter, which ends in September, is shaking out. Apple hasn’t given guidance since 2020, citing uncertainty, but they will provide us with some data points that they can use to determine whether Apple sees overall sales growing or shrinking. Wall street is expecting   * Revenue: $81.7 billion  > iPhone revenue: $40.2 billion  > iPad revenue: $6.4 billion  > Mac revenue: $6.3 billion  > Other products: $8.3 billion  > Services: $20.7 billion  * EPS: $1.19 per share  The company’s forecast will be more important. It may give clues as to whether global economies are set up for a “[soft landing](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/15/collective-embrace-of-soft-landing-economic-scenario-extends-2023-rally-after-welcome-drop-in-cpi.html)” after two years of interest rate hikes. The June period is typically Apple’s slowest quarter of the year, while its fourth fiscal quarter often captures back-to-school laptop spending, a few days of new iPhone model sales — which usually come out in September — and shows Apple’s momentum heading into the holiday season.  “What will matter most will be management’s September quarter,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst [Erik Woodring](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/erik-woodring) in July, adding that he expects Apple to guide to year-over-year revenue growth again.   I'm eager to see Apple give data points on India sales. Apple CEO Tim Cook traveled to the country in April and spoke about hopes for significant growth in the region. India became one of Apple’s top five iPhone markets during the quarter.  I don't know if people follow professional analyst notes, but [D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote this week,](https://dadavidson.com/Who-We-Serve/Equity-Capital-Markets/Our-Professionals/ECM-Profiles/ArticleID/1208/Tom-Forte-CFA) “On the call, we look for additional details on its expansion in India, including its retail and manufacturing presence.”   But Apple’s older growth driver, China, is likely to be closely watched as well. Greater China — including Hong Kong and Taiwan — is Apple’s third-largest sales region, and it has reported two straight quarters of revenue decline, even as the region reopened after years of strict Covid lockdowns.  “In our conversations, most investors feel that a soft China could pose a risk to the numbers and further commentary, but we feel that Apple’s position in China is on a solid footing and that the company is likely to see only a small if any decline in its iPhone sales,” wrote [Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar](https://www.pipersandler.com/about/people/harsh-kumar). Kumar said if China ends up being weak, it could be offset by strong sales momentum in India.  Apple mainly manufactures in China and investors will want to hear that the company has overcome many of the supply chain snags that have hampered sales over the past two years. If Apple stockpiled parts and has enough to make what it needs to produce, it could help margins.  Maybe people are tired of me tossing random names in the air, but a lot of these analysts are paid to do the heavy-hitting research, so it's only beneficial to read up on what they say. J.P. Morgan analyst [Samik Chatterjee](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/samik-chatterjee) thinks it is time to start viewing Apple in a new light, and I agree with this sentiment. Rather than seeing the tech giant as a product cycle company, it should be seen as a ‘resilient earnings compounder.’  “Apple’s diversified revenue drivers within Hardware, as well as the natural diversification of the replacement cycle for hardware product on account of a ~2 bn installed base of devices has moved the company incrementally away from being dependent on a product cycle relative to iPhones or any other hardware,” the analyst opined.  Moreover, the Services segment has grown significantly over time and is now well diversified in terms of its drivers, allowing it to achieve double-digit growth (excluding currency impact) even during challenging economic times. This “inherent diversification” positions the company next to other “’earnings compounders’ with resilient drivers.”  It also makes it easier to justify the premium multiple the stock has been trading at for the last six months, one which it is likely now to hold on to. Apple’s profitable services division includes monthly subscriptions such as Apple Music, warranties under AppleCare, fees from the App Store, advertising revenue from search licensing agreements with Google, payments from Apple Pay and other products. I'd like to see Apple’s services business grow regularly and smoothly, because the margins on services are so much higher than when Apple sells hardware. In particular, many analysts want to see services re-accelerate after a few quarters of weak growth because of lagging App Store software sales.  Apple suggested a 5.5% year-over-year increase in services](https://www.pymnts.com/apple/2023/apples-services-segment-slows-to-5-5-growth-rate/), and [FactSet’s](https://www.factset.com) estimates more than $20.7 billion in revenue. In fact, given the fact Apple is “well positioned to drive higher confidence from the upcoming earnings print as an ‘earnings compounder’ that continues to drive resilient performance,” Chatterjee thinks a new price target is due.  As for what to look out for in the report, Chatterjee expects the major highlight will be the pivot back to revenue growth on a year-over-year basis in F4Q23 (September quarter), boosted by “typical seasonality” in the majority of the business’ segments but with an additional kick from “moderating currency and improving Services growth rates as advertising rebounds.”  “The return to growth will mark Apple cycling past the most uncertain macro backdrop with resilient revenue and earnings, and well positioned to drive robust growth in a normal macro,” he said.  “For the Services business, we expect year-over-year revenue growth to accelerate from the +5% level expected in [fiscal third quarter,] with our checks suggesting online advertising has improved,” [Deutsche Bank analyst Sidney Ho](https://stockanalysis.com/analysts/sidney-ho/) wrote. But analysts will want to see Apple signal more growth than that.   We also need to keep in mind, Apple's AI acceleration. These analysts will also likely ask about artificial intelligence, given the industry wide obsession with the technology. There's also been a recent [Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/apple-preps-ajax-generative-ai-apple-gpt-to-rival-openai-and-google) that Apple is developing a ChatGPT-like AI model internally. Don’t expect Apple to gush about what it’s working on internally, though. “With the official intro of Vision Pro, we expect Apple’s updated comments on its AI aspirations to be a focus (albeit likely very high-level),” wrote [Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers.](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/aaron-rakers)  Apple reports its results by product line, which can give us a look into which businesses are thriving and which ones are in a down cycle. IPhone, iPad and Mac sales are all expected to be down on an annual basis, with iPad sales projected to drop nearly 11%. Wearables, the product category with headphones and Apple Watch — and what will likely be the reporting category for Vision Pro when it goes on sale — is projected to decline less than 1%. However, the experts expect Apple’s services business to grow 5.2% on an annual basis, which would be a bright spot for the report.  Given these details, I'm fairly sure AAPL calls will be the play today, but with high IV, I'm gonna grab a spread. I can buy the 8/4 192.5c for $300 and sell the 195c for $196. This means I can grab the spread for $104 each. Ideally, if AAPL were to go up just 1.8%, this means the spread can be sold at 140% profit.    **Amazon**  Okay, next is AMZN where analysts are predicting an earnings of $0.35 per share, significantly better than the loss of $0.200 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. In terms of sales, they anticipate an increase of 8.46% over the prior year quarter. For revenue, we expect them to report $131.49 billion. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts forecast a profit per share of $1.61. Data from [refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/en).  While revenue growth remains steady at Amazon, [it’s been stuck in the single digits](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/20/amazons-post-bezos-experiment-hasnt-gone-exactly-as-planned.html) for five out of the past six quarters. That trend is expected to continue, as analysts are looking for 8.5% growth in the second quarter and a number just slightly higher in the third period.  I believe Amazon’s expanding Amazon Web Services (AWS) will have a large impact on its second-quarter performance. Amazon Web Services has been a growth driver for years, but the pace of expansion is slowing as customers clamp down on spending due to an uncertain economic outlook. In the first quarter, AWS sales increased roughly 16%, the slowest growth since 2015, when Amazon began breaking out cloud revenue.   In the second quarter, AWS made its purpose-built security data lake, called Amazon Security Lake, generally available. The service aids in the simplification of compliance monitoring and security data management across hybrid and multi-cloud environments by centralizing an organization’s security data across AWS environments. It introduced a new configuration for Amazon Aurora, namely Amazon Aurora I/O-Optimized, which provides improved price performance and predictable pricing for I/O-intensive applications. It unveiled three new capabilities for its threat detection service called Amazon GuardDuty - GuardDuty EKS Runtime Monitoring, GuardDuty RDS Protection and GuardDuty Lambda Protection. AWS also announced the general availability of its no-code service, called AppFabric. I expect all these initiatives to have helped Amazon win customers. This, in turn, is expected to have boosted AWS’s second-quarter revenues, whose consensus mark stands at $21.49 billion, up 8.9% from the year-ago reported figure.  However, Brian Olsavsky (Amazon’s finance chief) warned in April that the company expects to see more of the same in the second quarter in cloud. In addition to cloud, profit margins will be an area of emphasis for investors, as well as artificial intelligence, a focus for companies across the sector.  “The key question will be whether management suggests that with the timing of the optimization cycle, AI workloads, and easing comps that AWS is likely to start showing revenue growth acceleration beginning in Q3,” analysts at [Evercore](https://www.evercore.com), who have the equivalent of a buy rating on Amazon, wrote in a note this week. “We don’t know.”  AWS rivals Microsoft and Alphabet last week reported solid results in their cloud businesses, beating analysts’ revenue expectations. But both companies said they continue to see organizations moderating their cloud spend.   Last week, Amazon hosted an AWS Summit, where the company announced updates related to generative AI, including a service that uses the technology to transcribe and summarize doctors’ patient visits. Amazon’s results will give investors a sense of whether the company’s ongoing cost-cutting efforts are beginning to bear fruit. Evercore analysts said they expect to see improving margins in Amazon’s retail business in the second quarter, as “comps against ’22′s massive cost spikes, capacity utilization recovers, and newfound efficiencies from the regionalization of Amazon’s retail operations kick in.”  Recent data released by the company showed improving delivery speeds and efficiencies in Amazon’s fulfillment network. The company said it’s made significant headway on its efforts to establish one- and same-day delivery as the standard for Prime members, while also bringing costs down. Also during the quarter, Amazon hosted its annual Prime Day discount bonanza, which they claim as its “biggest ever.” Amazon’s guidance for the third quarter could give a glimpse into how much Prime Day lifted sales.  Amazon’s advertising business is becoming increasingly important to the company’s financials. Several industry surveys have indicated a slow rebound in the digital ad market may be underway. Meta showed better-than-expected results last week, but rival Snap fell short of sales expectations and gave a weak forecast for the current quarter.  With Amazon's earnings, it's certainly a toss up. But I'm learning bullish. I'm gonna go ahead and do another call spread, getting AMZN 130c at $380 a pop, and selling the 135c at $195 each. This means I can grab the spread for $185 each. If AMZN were to go up with earnings, just 4.8%, this play will profit 170%.   **Coinbase**  Last and certainly least, there's Coinbase. I don't know if anyone rememebers but the SEC [sued the crypto exchange](https://blockworks.co/news/sec-sues-coinbase) not too long ago. The lawsuit is in regards to them allegedly operating as an unregistered exchange.   At today's earnings, investors are gonna be listening to hear about trading volumes and adjusted EBITDA. Coinbase improved its net loss from $557 million during the fourth quarter of last year to $79 million in the first three months of 2023. The exchange generated $284 million in adjusted EBITDA — earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — last quarter compared to a $124 million loss in the prior quarter.   “Unlike last quarter [when] we saw potential upside going into the print, this quarter is the opposite,” said [Owen Lau](https://sps.columbia.edu/faculty/owen-lau), an executive director at Oppenheimer and Co. Lau mentioned that he estimates Coinbase’s trading volume will have fallen 34% quarter over quarter — from $145 billion to $91 billion. The exchange’s adjusted EBITDA could fall about 90% to $29 million, he added.  [Mark Palmer](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/mark-palmer), an analyst for Berenberg Capital Markets, said the [Ripple ruling](https://blockworks.co/news/xrp-ruling-sec) and the prospects of a spot [bitcoin ETF](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/03/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-application-refiled-naming-coinbase-as-surveillance-sharing-partner/) approval have given some investors “a false sense of confidence” about Coinbase’s prospects.  In addition to weak transaction volumes, Coinbase’s results are likely to reflect lower interest income from USD Coin (the digital stablecoin). The exchange, which [introduced the stablecoin](https://www.coinbase.com/) with payments company Circle in 2018, offers users rewards by holding USD Coin on Coinbase.  Interest income rose to about $240 million during the first quarter, up from $182 million during the prior quarter. Of that $240 million, $199 million was USD Coin, Coinbase said in its Q1 shareholder letter. But USD Coin’s market capitalization has fallen by more than 50% over the past year.  “We see no reason why Coinbase’s guidance for the balance of the year should be particularly encouraging,” Palmer said. “While interest income on USD Coin has been a tailwind for Coinbase since interest rates started to rise, the continued decline in the stablecoin’s market cap raises real questions about the extent to which that income will support its operating performance going forward.”  Morningstar Analyst [Michael Miller](https://www.morningstar.com/authors/2412/michael-miller) said he will be paying particular attention to Coinbase’s expenses and non-trading revenue sources. So will I. The exchange’s operating expenses fell to $896 million in the first three months of 2023, a 24% drop from the previous quarter. The figure represented its lowest level of expenses since the first quarter of 2021.   “Coinbase has signaled that it’s pulling back on its investment spending during weak cryptocurrency markets and what it chooses to continue to invest in will indicate what it sees as priorities,” Miller mentioned.   Still, Coinbase said in its May shareholder letter that it expected second quarter expenses to increase due in part to higher legal expenses. Miller said he is also keeping an eye on any momentum Coinbase reports related to reducing its reliance on transaction fees.   Coinbase’s so-called subscription and services revenue, the bulk of which was interest income last quarter, also includes blockchain rewards from staking and custodial fee revenue. Combined, the category brought in about $362 million last quarter, compared to $375 million of transaction revenue.     “Coinbase being selected to provide custodial and surveillance services for a potential Blackrock ETF is a win on this front,” he said. “But it remains to be seen how much subscription and service growth Coinbase can create outside of interest income, which is now facing major headwinds.”   Guidance around the road forward as Coinbase deals with the SEC’s lawsuit could be helpful as well. The SEC has said it would oppose any motion brought by Coinbase seeking to dismiss the commission’s lawsuit. Honestly, any update related to Coinbase’s regulatory issues would very interesting but I’m not really expecting anything material to come out with earnings.  As a result of my research, I'm just gonna go ahead and get puts. COIN 8/4 90p is $420, and the 85p is trading at $242. Which means I can get a put spread for $178. Like the previous plays, I'm buying the more expensive contract, and selling the cheaper one as a hedge. If the stock were to drop 7.1%, this spread will profit 181%.";"68";"2023-08-03T21:33:44"

"Why I think Amazon is a Buy Despite Growing Competition from Shein and Temu";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ae4vtn/why_i_think_amazon_is_a_buy_despite_growing/";"**Rising Challenges for the Everything Store**  The once-dominant position of Amazon as the 'Everything Store' is facing challenges from low-cost competitors like Temu, Shein, and TikTok, which are gaining popularity globally.  **Amazon's Evolving Strategy**  Amazon, recognizing the threat, is evolving its strategy to maintain its position. However, it faces a delicate balance between staying competitive and preserving profit margins, which have become crucial for investor confidence.  **Strengths and Recent Developments**  Diversification into Advertising: Amazon's move to integrate advertising into Prime Video could bolster its already substantial ad business, generating nearly $44 billion annually. Analysts estimate potential incremental video ad revenue of over $2 billion next year.  **Financial Performance:**  Amazon's financial performance is improving, with an expected 11% revenue growth for 2023, compared to 9% in 2022. Operating income is projected to reach $34 billion, reflecting a record-high margin of 6%.  **Challenges from Competitors:**  Chinese players Temu and Shein, specializing in affordable products, pose a threat with rapidly increasing shipments in the U.S. TikTok, with its integrated shopping and ambitious e-commerce goals, adds to the competitive landscape.  **Striking a Balance**  Fee Adjustments: Amazon has adjusted fees for its third-party business, reducing commissions for sellers of low-priced apparel. This move is seen as a response to compete with Temu and Shein. Striking a balance is crucial to remain competitive without compromising profit margins.  **Core Business Focus:**  While Amazon diversifies into various segments, its core business of online retail remains vital. Balancing growth and avoiding single-digit growth challenges are critical to sustaining its position.  **Profit Margins and Investor Expectations**  **AWS vs. Overall Profit:**   While Amazon Web Services (AWS) commands a significant operating margin of 29%, contributing substantially to revenue, Amazon's companywide margin was impacted in 2022. The challenge is to balance the highly profitable AWS with the broader business.  **Stock Performance:**   Amazon's stock price surged by 81% in the previous year. Wall Street expects a strong bottom line, with a focus on 'Harvest Mode' to maintain high margins and stock outperformance in 2024.  **Analyst Outlook:**   Analysts anticipate 36% annual growth in operating income over the next three years, contrasting with 11% annual revenue growth. The emphasis on 'Harvest Mode' reflects a shift from lower-margin investment phases in Amazon's history.  **Conclusion: Navigating Challenges for Future Growth**  As Amazon faces growing competition and strives to maintain profitability, its strategic moves and emphasis on high-margin segments become crucial. The balance between staying competitive in the retail landscape and satisfying investor expectations will determine Amazon's trajectory in the coming years. Cheap alternatives alone may not be enough to unravel the Everything Store, given Amazon's extensive fulfillment network and the loyalty of its Prime membership base.";"18";"2024-01-29T21:11:14"
"Amazon Balancing On The Edge - Will It Lead Anywhere?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/187lesu/amazon_balancing_on_the_edge_will_it_lead_anywhere/";"So, the story is that Amazon's been in a tight spot since 2019, dealing with one investigation after another. Each hit caused a blow to $AMZN. But at least the government's taking some action, and the House Committee on the Judiciary also joined all this digging into Amazon.  In short, it all started in 2020 when articles from CNBC, Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal with investigations started dropping, causing stock falls.   The grand finale came in October 2020 with news about the FTCS, triggering another stock drop. And that's how 2020 ended, with Amazon in the headlines.   Then, in 2022, the Wall Street Journal came out with an article about the SEC investigating Amazon, and (surprise) $AMZN fell once again.  Throughout all this, Amazon kept silence about any risks tied to their shady moves. And finally investors [filed a lawsuit](https://11thestate.com/cases/amazon-investor-suit) against them, and it's Washington deal now.  Now, after this whole saga, what's your take?

Amazon had originally agreed in August 2022 to acquire iRobot for 61 USD per share all cash, with the price being amended to 51 USD per share after iRobot borrowed money to cover operating expenses.   The stock went from 30 USD a share to as high as 42.9 USD per share on Friday. It has since returned to 34 USD per share.   Prospectuses claim that the iRobot Merger deadline is set at February 08 2024 by Amazon and iRobot, and can be extended 6 months upon mutual agreement. The EU however has set a deadline for making an antitrust decision on this merger at February 14 2024 to intentionally confuse investors.  I should have took this as a sign that there would be frequent pumps and dumps on iRobot stock.   &#x200B:  In order for the merger to close before the deadline, iRobot and Amazon needs to secure EU approval and CIFUS certification. CIFUS certification must be obtained before day 45 of any official foreign/domestic level 2 probe into a merger, and may extend investigations by 15 days under extenuating circumstances.  1. No draft is necessary for this case, so Amazon and iRobot are already saving 28 days. 2. The agency will take 2 weeks to review the materials and ask for any additional documentation. 3. CIFUS had already done a 45 day initial investigation during September - October 2023.  4. CIFUS will ask Amazon to respond to inquires after 45 day period , and provides a 3 business day window for a response, December 02 latest.  5. Upon the scheduling of a hearing to appeal the European Commission's decision, CIFUS will extend its investigation by 15 days, not including the 15 days for which the US President has an opportunity to block a deal for National Security reasons.

The company outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 14% to $170 billion.

I also am anticipating Amazon will release a dividend like META and GOOG, which I'll go into a lot of detail later.   Let's talk about AMZN's ride over the past few years—it's been a bit of a roller coaster, especially when you stack it up against the S&P 500. Back in early 2021, AMZN was hovering around $165. Fast forward to now, and it's ticked up to about $180. Sounds decent, right? But hold up, because that's nothing compared to the S&P, which has shot up by roughly 35% in the same period.  Looking at the yearly breakdown: AMZN only inched up by 2% in 2021, then took a massive 50% dive in 2022, but bounced back hard with an 81% surge in 2023. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 had its own drama but less extreme, posting a 27% gain in 2021, dropping 19% in 2022, and climbing back up by 24% in 2023.  The takeaway? While AMZN did outperform the S&P in 2023, it lagged behind in the previous years. And this isn't just an AMZN thing—other big names in the Consumer Discretionary sector like TSLA, TM, and HD, and even tech giants like GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL have also found it tough to consistently beat the S&P, in both up and down markets. So, what's next for AMZN? Let's keep our eyes peeled for their upcoming earnings report.  # Revenue Beat  Amazon’s revenues grew 12% y-o-y to $574.8 billion in FY2023. All major categories posted growth in the year – online stores (5%), physical stores (6%), third-party seller services (19%), subscription services (14%), advertising services (24%), and AWS (13%). We expect the same trend to continue in Q1. Overall, we forecast Amazon’s revenues to touch $641.4 billion for the full-year 2024.  # EPS Beat   Amazon Q1 2024 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.85 per Trefis analysis, 2% above the consensus estimate of $0.83. The adjusted net income increased from -$2.7 billion to $30.4 billion in FY 2023. It was primarily because of lower operating expenses as a % of revenues, higher revenues, and a significant jump in the total non-operating income from -$18.2 billion to $705 million. Notably, the non-operating income was down in 2022 due to a marketable equity securities valuation loss. Further, the same trend was witnessed in Q4 2023. We expect the Q1 results to be on similar lines. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $4.12 and revenue per share of $61.48 for the full-year 2024.  # Possible Dividend Announcement  Meta threw out its first dividend this March, and Google's parent company Alphabet isn't far behind, announcing a 20 cent dividend set for mid-June. This leaves us wondering about Amazon—when are they joining the dividend party?  By the numbers, it seems like it’s about time Amazon starts giving back some quarterly cash to its shareholders. Over the last decade, Amazon has racked up a cool $90 billion in free cash flow. Out of that giant pot, it only used about $6 billion for share buybacks in 2022, which is roughly a 7% capital return.  In comparison, other trillion-dollar behemoths have been way more generous, returning about 75% of their free cash flow over the past year—though most of that was through share repurchases rather than dividends. Together, these non-Amazon trillion-dollar companies generated around $323 billion in cash flow over the last year, paid out $38 billion in dividends, and snapped up about $240 billion in their own stock.  For Amazon, cash flow isn't the issue. Wall Street's looking at a projected free cash flow of about $62 billion for 2024, which is expected to jump to $82 billion by 2025, per Bloomberg. So, the big question remains: when will Amazon start sending some of that cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends? Let's stay tuned and see if they'll open up their wallet.  But what would this look like? If Amazon decided to payout 75% of its projected 2024 free cash flow, we're talking about a dividend yield of around 2.4%. That actually beats the average 2.2% yield from other dividend-paying companies in the S&P.  This 2.4% isn't just dividends—it includes any buybacks Amazon might throw into the mix. To give you a benchmark, the total shareholder yield for S&P 500 dividend payers has been about 3.3% over the past year. With Amazon’s hefty cash flow, it’s looking more and more like they’re due to start sharing the wealth.  Just for context, consider a bit of history. Microsoft went public back in 1986, and it took them 17 years and a revenue climb from less than $200 million to $32 billion before they started paying dividends in 2003. Since then, Microsoft’s sales have been growing at a steady 10% yearly, with around $28 in dividends per share dished out to date. Fast forward to 2024, Microsoft’s expected to hit sales around $260 billion.  Amazon, on the other hand, went public in 1997 and has exploded from $600 million to nearly $600 billion in annual sales. With projections showing a growth rate of about 12% over the next few years, Amazon is well-positioned to both fuel further growth and start paying dividends.  Currently, Microsoft’s stock yields about 0.8%. If Amazon wanted to match this, they’d need to allocate roughly 20% of their forecasted free cash flow for the next two years to dividends—totally doable since S&P 500 dividend payers typically spend about half their free cash flow on dividends.  Bottom line: Amazon doesn’t need to aim for a 0.8% yield right off the bat. Kicking things off with literally any dividend would be a solid move. And if they do so, the stock will PUMP. This is why I'm getting calls for earnings. A call spread would be good, for those who can't get a call spread, AMZN 5/3 190c @ 3.20 doesn't look too bad. I'm picking 190c because the stock has *on average* moved about 7% up or down with earnings. A 7% push up today would bring the stock to about 192ish. Not enough for the calls to profit, so getting a call spread is deal. To do this, I'll just sell the 200c @ 1.19. So the cost of the whole position becomes 2.01/share. Not too bad. Good luck guys.";"266";"2024-04-30T18:03:31"

"$AMZN Earnings Tuesday";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cfmrhe/amzn_earnings_tuesday/";"I think Amazon will have a pretty decent pop after earnings on Tuesday, for a few reasons:  # Continuing to Cut Costs  Amazon has seen many rounds of layoffs in the post-Covid era, and those have continued in Q1 and Q2 this year. Most recently they have nixed their just walk out technology for Fresh stores and the associated teams in AWS. Investment in unproven or unprofitable technology which ran rampant with Bezos is being eliminated under Jassy, contrast this with Meta continuing to light money on fire for the metaverse vision, and how their earnings went. The result is a leaner more profitable machine in the short term, though long term innovation could suffer.  # AI Strategy  Amazon may say they're in the race for Generative AI, but we all know they can't compare to OpenAI's models. They don't need to though. Their focus has been on creating a marketplace where most models are owned by third parties such as Anthropic, Meta, Mistral and open source models. AWS provides the infrastructure and customers pay a premium for it, knowing their data will stay in the AWS network along with their other existing cloud infrastructure. This makes a big difference for Fortune 500 and other large customers focused on security. Apart from pay-per-token, which all AI SaaS companies offer, AWS Bedrock also  offers purchasing blocks of capacity called Model Units for 1 or 6 month commitments to guarantee certain levels of token throughput. They will see a big boost in sales for these and it will boost outlook for next 2 quarters. They are struggling to keep up with demand for underlying GPU infra, which will be a good thing for the numbers. Lastly, on Tuesday Amazon will announce GA for it's next gen home-grown model Titan Text Premium. While I still don't think it will compete with OpenAI or even Anthropic's offerings, it will provide more choice and cost optimization for customers, and will be seen as a good thing at least by the C-Suites of the large companies choosing AWS Bedrock over OpenAI. And that's all that matters.  # Prime Day  Prime Day 2024 has been announced for July. Each of the past prime days have always seen new record high sales and beat internal estimates, so Q3 outlook will be juicy.  # NBA Rights  Amazon Prime has reached an agreement with the NBA to air games starting with the 2025-6 season. The contract will likely last for 10 years. Coupled with the success of their TNF deal and price hikes plus ads addition to Prime Video, the streaming service outlook will be strong.  # Investors Over Employees  Andy the Jasshole and his S-Team aka the Jass Band have really made corporate employees unhappy with how the return to office mandate has been handled, denying annual pay raises this year across the board for all L6+ employees, and layoffs. A lot of talent is leaving voluntarily, senior engineering positions are being backfilled with junior level positions, and the company has pitched this as a good thing. Andy is being a good boy and doing exactly what the board and his major shareholders want, Bezos' long term thinking and customer focus can go to hell. Certainly cuts cost in the short term, but I think this is analogous to overmilking a cow. At some point, they will run out of manipulations and see diminishing returns. While I'm bearish on Amazon in the long term as I think the tech will start to crumble and competitors will be poised to take market share, it's all good news for Q2 costs and outlook. Like the my other points, this just means lower cost structure and stronger guidance for 2024-5. Google is using the same playbook and they did just fine on earnings. It will be some time before both of their reckonings come, and by then Andy and Sundar will have safely landed their golden parachutes.  # Summary / tl:dr  I'm a highly regarded individual and don't have numbers to back my thoughts up, but I know Amazon well. Earnings will show big profits and strong outlook. ~~I don't have any position yet but will update tomorrow, just planned this over the weekend.

"Why I believe in Rivian (RIVN)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/14vz6sg/why_i_believe_in_rivian_rivn/";"I shall keep this brief as possible because I want to hear everybody's thoughts on this,   Here are some of the main reasons as to why I'm so bullish on Rivian:   \- They have an earnings call coming in Early August    \- Using Amazon's money, they've been able to build the infrastructure for constructing their commercial vehicles + their service vehicles like Amazon's delivery truck, being able to deliver on their contract with Amazon will set them up for future success  \- They're also in talks with Amazon to be able to sell their delivery trucks potentially to other 3rd parties, this opens up another avenue of revenue for them  \- (This one is more of a meme and maybe awareness bias) I keep seeing them around NYC and California and have seen a handful in Miami, I have yet to see a single Ford F-150 Lightning being driven on the road or any other electric truck    \- The cars are fun and people enjoy them and they serve a nice techno-adventure niche (I can totally see many Jeep drivers converting to this for their off road vehicle): they are geared toward a demographic that values high utility vehicles, I think in the next couple of years people will be heavily choosing to buy either a Tesla or a Rivian   \- Converting to Tesla's NACS charging standard by 2025 and adopting the Tesla Supercharger network will be huge as they seek to release their lower price point vehicle the R2, which is rumored to be starting close to 40-60K, and will also possibly convince many people who are on the fence about buying a Rivian over a Tesla.   \- As I saw somebody else on this subreddit mention,  even if the stock returns to it's lowest price point of $12, they still have tangible assets, backing by Amazon, and are actually delivering Electric trucks year over year, for a stock that IPOd at $106, a price of $25 is an absolute steal and I can see it easily going past $40 within the next month.    \- They just had their best quarter ever in 2023, delivering more than 20,000 vehicles  Rivian results year-to-date in 2023:  * Production: 23,387 (up 236% year-over-year) * Deliveries: 20,586 (up 262% year-over-year)     I think this is one of those stocks that people are going to be kicking themselves for not buying more when it was at its lowest point (which I already am).

"$CELH is poised to beat tomorrow";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1b2npa3/celh_is_poised_to_beat_tomorrow/";"Celsius Holdings, Inc. (CELH) reports tomorrow at 6 am and I think it's very likely to beat estimates. I am basing my analysis to the product sales data on Amazon via Junglescout.  https://preview.redd.it/sc1jl884dflc1.png?width=2534&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd1130dd856a6b05698a57944dda1b4f4ea0865  The product has seen consistent sales growth over the past year, and it currently holds the #1 spot in both the Grocery & Gourmet Food and Energy Drinks categories. The sales volume seems to have spiked last quarter and the street has not accounted for this spike. The recent surge in units sold per month in Q4 indicates accelerating demand for Celsius products. This increased sales velocity suggests a strong likelihood of the company exceeding analysts' revenue estimates of $331 million.  Earning estimates  **2023 Q3**  Period Ending Sep 2023  **EPS**  Reported 0.297  Estimate 0.171  Surprise 0.126 (73.91%)  **Revenue**  Reported 384.757M  Estimate 351.535M  Surprise 33.222M (9.45%)  **2023 Q4**  2023 Q4  Period Ending  Dec 2023  **EPS**  Estimate 0.157  **Revenue**  Estimate 331.551M  The analysis is pretty simple here.  On Amazon they sold 357,539 units in Q3 and they sold 727,067 in Q4. This is a huge delta compared to the difference in the revenue estimates from analysts. Amazon is only 7.5% of their sales volume and they are very dependent on Pepsi for distribution. The bet is that the uptick is universal across all their channels.  Analysts are clueless, they think revenue will barely budge, but Celsius CRUSHED IT on Amazon! This stock has a 21% short interest.     * **Fact Check:**  I am relying on JungleScout - the data has been accurate in the past. * **Disclaimer:** This is not financial advice  * **Update:** So looks like there has been an earnings leak with a 5% revenue beat. Stretch of an ask here but please DM me the Bloomberg page if any of you have a terminal. Need to figure out if Bloomberg caught it or the Bloomberg screenshot is fake.   * **Update:** Sold at $80.

Dish shares jumped 18% following the news, while shares of Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T all dropped. (After this story published, Amazon reached out wanting to clarify that Amazon, Verizon and T-Mobile have all denied the rumor that was reported by Bloomberg on June 2. Dish declined to comment. This Industry Voices article is speculation by one industry analyst.)  ## Prime Wireless, powered by Dish?  What had the markets so excited about a potentially transformative tie-up? In a word: timing. The timing could not be more perfect for Dish and Amazon to make each other an offer they can’t refuse, and for consumers to break away from the retail environment of the big three carriers. Wireless networks, like any other facilities-based business, are monetized through their use and in order to thrive, they need vast numbers of users consuming throughput.  Despite [declining retail customer adoption](https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/dish-drops-another-210k-wireless-subs-2q), Dish’s wireless efforts to date to field a nationwide 5G network have [just passed 70% coverage](https://about.dish.com/2023-06-15-The-DISH-5G-Network-is-Now-Available-to-Over-70-Percent-of-the-U-S-Population) of the U.S. population and the company has built much of the infrastructure and institutional knowledge necessary to power a nationwide network rollout – but only if they can start realizing the benefits of owner economics.  Meanwhile, Amazon, with its giant built-in ecosystem of loyal customers, effortless purchasing and its ability to cross-collateralize ultra-cheap, or even free, wireless service, could be just the catalyst to make that mass customer migration possible. In fact, according to the latest J.D. Power data on wireless customer loyalty, 37% of current wireless customers say they selected their carrier based on price.  Among Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) customers, that rate jumps to 69%. Put another way, 6 in 10 wireless customers of the kind ultimately served by AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon through flanker or other brands like Metro, Cricket and Consumer Cellular are at risk of conquest by a radical Dish/Amazon combo offer.  ## Wireless customers hungry for an alternative  Consider the variables at play: a macroeconomic environment of sky-high inflation where everything feels too expensive and everyone is looking to find ways to cut costs. A ubiquitous digital giant that already has deep customer relationships with nearly every consumer in the country. A hungry and financially motivated outsider that has been plotting a move like this for years. Something new and different in a sea of same. Could these be the beginning of the thread that forces the big three into a model that looks more like what streamers have done to the video subscribers count of cable TV?     While a union of Dish and Amazon does make a lot of sense from a timing and incentivization perspective, those factors alone would not necessarily ensure its success – many strategic partnerships have seemed like perfect fits before fizzling out. What makes this potential pairing so intriguing is its clear path to success. Customers already appear to be willing to break free of the big three carriers if the price is right, and that sentiment will only grow stronger if the low-cost carrier is associated with a brand they know and already trust.  Beyond the widespread interest among consumers in switching wireless providers for lower cost alternatives, [eSIM technology](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/esim-cards-faq) has made it even easier for customers to become carrier agnostic. Without physical SIM cards tying customers to the carrier-specific phones, an Amazon/Dish partnership could easily employ a “try it, you’ll like it” strategy deployed through its app to onboard customers in the short-term while angling to retain them for the long haul, all while offering complimentary trials of Amazon/Dish services to boot. Now, what if those prospects were offered to try a Dish-powered wireless network with an Amazon gift card as a kicker?  Amazon has another ace up its sleeve: its existing mesh network. Amazon has already tried to seamlessly connect various customer devices through mesh networks with [Amazon Sidewalk](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/everything-you-need-to-know-about-amazon-sidewalk). Supercharging this connectivity with wireless access network enables a near-term future where a customer’s Alexa and Echo devices boost the Dish 5G cell phone service with Wi-Fi backhaul. Amazon’s personal assistant devices are already so ubiquitous that device connectivity would likely be seamless. Forget about more cell towers in residential neighborhoods – an inexpensive phone with an Amazon network that could get signal boosts in bad-reception areas of the house would be incentive enough for plenty of customers to switch.   Perhaps most importantly, that’s two massive, double-digit billion-dollar infrastructure investments (owning an ISP, and building a physical wireless network/acquiring spectrum) that Amazon either already has or doesn’t have to undertake in order to enter and compete in this space.  ## Where do we go from here?  While Dish likely sees any deal between itself and Amazon as a “2024 event,” according to Chairman Charlie Ergen, it’s hard to deny that the market conditions make a deal getting done in the near-term a logical conclusion. Two of the big three wireless providers are already vulnerable. Between lagging financial performance, executive shake ups and customer loyalty becoming more and more fleeting, there’s never been a better time for Amazon and Dish to make a big move. And if it happens, it has a chance to send ripple effects throughout the wireless and retail spaces.  Not everyone agrees, of course. AT&T CFO Pascal Desroches, for one, recently [downplayed](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/atandt-cfo-likens-amazon-mobile-rumor-to-seinfeld-/d/d-id/785359) the likelihood of an Amazon foray into wireless, saying: “It’s sort of like those of you who watch Seinfeld. It’s a show about nothing. This was a rumor about nothing.”  To Desroches point, many crucial details – like what effect a deal would have on the price of Prime, what infrastructure would need to be enhanced to handle a vast and unexpectedly quick subscriber increase, how device retailers would be incorporated (or wound down – Amazon is among the largest seller of mobile phones on the planet) – will have to be ironed out. But this could be a deal that makes too much sense to dismiss completely. One way or another, Amazon is likely to come ([back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Phone)) to wireless faster than you can say, “one-click purchase,” and that could be enough to finally lead Dish to the promised land, too.  **The chart looks like it's going to break out to the upside** 🚀  https://preview.redd.it/g6jcndpxy0eb1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fddad9ac7397d15403140c4d45c2fb5f6471ac0  **The FLOAT is 22% SHORT**  **🍋 (Is this the next $GME, $AMC, $CVNA, $SIRI?... $DISH has a legit turn around opportunity with $AMZN)**  https://preview.redd.it/d4ibcvm1z0eb1.png?width=1402&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e906c910104319ac19ae85e294cddd4ab313476  **June 2, 2023 rumours surfaced again and you can see the stock reactions below  👀**  https://preview.redd.it/41h3ttx701eb1.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7200aeaf57ed3f8e730b83f889036a9432c2a31";"78";"2023-07-25T04:45:46"
"$DISH is extremely undervalued";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/15bitm7/dish_is_extremely_undervalued/";"So I got into $DISH because of the Dish guy on here a few days ago, but before buying into it, I wanted to make sure it was a good company and I wasn't buying into trash.   I've bought into FRC, AMC, WISH, SOS, TLRY, RAD and many other meme stocks here, so it's fair to say I'm regarded and I've made and lost a lot of money on my stupid plays but I have told myself I am done playing stupid and I need to invest in better companies.   So despite the news of Dish selling phone plans on Amazon, I looked at their balance sheet, and I feel this is one of the most undervalued companies on the market.   Because many regards here don't look at the balance sheet, let's take a close look.   As of last quarter they have  Cash on hand: $2.54B  Total long term debt: $20.53B  Total liabilities: $35.38B  Total assets $56.562B  Total Shareholder Equity: $18.183B (AFTER debt)  Current market cap: $3.72B  In the last year, they've made over 5 billion in profit, as a failing company, their total profit is less than the market cap of the company. How often do you find a company that has made over 5 billion, offers over 18B in book value, trading for under 4 billion? it's a steal.  A lot of that debt has been added over the last few years as they've built out their 5G network to compete with other providers along with purchasing Boost Mobile from Sprint for $1.4 billion.  As you can see even with what customer base is left after all the cord cutting, and now with the new Amazon deal, they are still a very profitable company. They are trading as if they are going to spiral into bankruptcy, but as of right now unless something changes, they are a profitable company that is able to pay all its debts, on top of that, even if shareholder equity was only $10 billion, it's still trading at 3 times less than it should be, the book value as of right now is over 18 billion, yet it's trading at 3.72B, it's a steal.   I also believe that this is a trial period of Amazon selling their Sim cards and cell phone services through their website, if Amazon sees that they are selling well and doing well through Amazon, I believe Dish will have a good chance of being acquired by Amazon, but I believe Amazon wants to see how well they do first before taking that leap, but even if they do, Amazon would be buying a profitable company, that they could integrate into their own services with Prime Video and a 5G network already built out as most of the leg work has already been done.  Even if Amazon never acquires them and that isn't the play (which I totally believe will happen eventually) the big play here is this, they are still a very profitable company, they realize that they are losing customers at a rapid pace on their Dish network services and they've noticed it for a while, so now they are trying to transition to a cell phone provider while they still are making money from their satellite company to roll this transition out.  Lastly, I do expect a decent earnings here as their last earnings was a disaster with over 552,000 people that left due to a cyberattack that left their entire network down for a week, I believe there will be some decline in the satellite division, but I also expect them to push their new cell phone and 5G net work as the future of the company, as even if they were to sell the network they built out alone with 5G, it would be worth more than the debt and 3.72B market cap this is currently trading at. I believe people will finally see the value that they are bringing to the table and the stock will jump to the $10-12 range.   The IV is also higher on the call side than put side, and it's been that way for a bit, so I think even the hedge funds know this is undervalued and expect it to go higher.   I could be wrong, so do your own DD. I'm holding through earnings and jumping ship if I am wrong.   Position 7,400 shares - yes I'm a bag holder but my DD stands, and I know when to cut my losses, so troll me if you want lol  tl:dr - Dish Network is undervalued, they are transitioning into a new industry and already built a lot of the 5G network out to over 240 million Americans (70% of the population) that alone would be worth it for Amazon or some other big player to purchase off of them. The company isn't going bankrupt, but they're being priced as they are.   Only invest what you're willing to lose... or YOLO idc";"0";"2023-07-28T02:49:24"

Amazon uses autoplay whenever the TV turns on **and** they boost the volume of the ad versus regular TV audio. I know these things to be factual, and I hate Amazon’s TVs.

"WAYFAIR (TICKER: W) PRICE INCREASE COMING";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1atzwdd/wayfair_ticker_w_price_increase_coming/";"Mods keep on deleting my posts about Wayfair. I'm not quite sure why, perhaps it's the comments... I'll try again...  **Wayfair (W)**  Wayfair, ticker symbol: W. Please hear my thought process out.. I am making this assessment based on the following factors:  1. Growing Short interest - currently 26% of the stock is shorted. 5-6% is considered normal. 10% is considered very high. Current short term interest is 3x the amount of what is considered high, and could turn into a very lucrative short squeeze opportunity. 2. Strong revenue growth and stabilizing costs. We’ll discuss this further in the DD below. 3. I like the stock - Fortune favors the bold, it’s the first ones to jump in first who reap the best tendies.  The DD…  **What is Wayfair:**  Wayfair is a leading e-commerce retailer in the home furnishings space - if you own a home, or furnished your apartment, chances are you purchased from Wayfair or stumbled upon their website at some point.  Wayfair Stock Price History:  5-year trading range for Wayfair has been $31 to $340, reaching their all time high post COVID due to an incredible user acquisition and revenue growth while everyone was confined to their homes and renovating home offices for WFH. The decline came in the years following the COVID boom as aggressive management growth initiatives led to increasing overhead and their hockey stick revenue growth charts began to normalize after the COVID boom.  **The Fundamentals:**  Brick and mortar retail regained a large portion of the market share that online businesses originally captured while e-commerce could continue to operate their businesses during COVID and brick and mortars had to keep their businesses closed. I believe the COVID boom on e-commerce in general pushed the growing online shopping trend forward by at least 5-years, forcing many who felt uncomfortable with shopping online to adopt out of necessity. Wayfair seems to have only lost a portion of that COVID market share, we see this with Revenue growth that significantly outpaces pre-COVID 2019 revenues by 30%.  I imagine there is far less home decorating going on tight now as interest rates have risen to cyclical highs and home buying has slowed down.  These two fundamentals describe a short term negative trend - from a peak to trough - and I believe Wayfair is currently in the trough and ripe for a correction soon.  Several analysts have reported the bottoming out of the home furnishings industry - see article from Raymond James analyst dated 2-16-2024 where the stock was upgraded to a STRONG BUY with a price target of $65 for the year ([https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wayfair-upgraded-at-raymond-james-on-compelling-mediumterm-riskreward-432SI-3306362](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wayfair-upgraded-at-raymond-james-on-compelling-mediumterm-riskreward-432SI-3306362)).  The fed is planning to cut interest rates this year, which will trigger the beginning of the home buying frenzy.  YOY revenue growth for Wayfair has been relatively stable in the range of +/- 5%, but still significantly surpassing PRE-COVID 2019 revenue of 9.15B with an estimated revenue target of 12.2B for 2023 if you account for the average analyst prediction for 2023 Q4 and annualize. This compares to a flat YOY 2022 in 2023, a good sign that the worst is behind us.  **The Technical Analysis:**  Wayfair broke through their 200-day MA on 1/19 and then again on 2/12. It broke through the 200-day MA again on the intra-day trade on 2/16, but closed for the day just beneath it. There is a strong channel formation with support at the $48.25 range and resistance at the $55.25 range. I will be a holder of this stock so long as it does not trade below the $48.25 support level. I believe there is a lot of upside if it breaches the $55.25 resistance level and remains above the 200-day MA.  **Important Events/Dates to look for:**  Wayfair reports revenue for the 2023 Q4 quarter on 2/22 and this is the closing quarter for the 2023 fiscal year. We are looking for revenues on par with 2022 Q4 estimated at 3.1B. Most analyst research I have read anticipate an earnings beat which would be very bullish for the stock. Their recent cost-cutting initiatives (13% global staff layoff resulting in $260M annual cost savings) will materialize in 2024 over the full year. We're looking to hear managements feedback about continuing these cost savings initiatives to return the company back to profitability over 2024 and 2025.  **Additional Fundamentals:**  Wayfair's costs have held them back as large institutional investors and investment banks look for consistent stock profitability otherwise they punish the stock. We see this in Wayfair's largely miscalculated cost increases in 2021 and 2022 to drive market share expansion, leading to a peak loss of ($1.3B) in net annual income. This figure is projected to be around ($600M) for 2023 when they report on 2/22, and it represents greater than a -50% reduction in losses YOY. Coupled with their recent layoffs and cost saving initiatives from the start of 2024, I believe Wayfair is on course to achieve the range of ($300M) to potentially even net positive income on the highly optimistic end for 2024.  Wayfair has been in growth mode following in the early footsteps of their big brother Amazon. The key differences between Wayfair and Amazon is their assortment - Wayfair dominates in the home furnishings space as Amazon has significant challenges with large furniture items in their FC's - there is a reason why Amazon does not offer prime delivery on televisions with screens larger than 55"" - they rely on their suppliers to dropship these items along with similar oversized items like furniture that are usually not offered for sale through FBA or PRIME on Amazon. Wayfair is also much better than Amazon at selling premium/luxury brands through their AllModern and Perigold sales channels. Wayfair is also exceptionally better than Amazon with their private label initiatives - with dozens or private label brands that allow them to skirt around manufacturer's minimum advertised price policies.  Wayfair has a significant tactical advantage in the Home Furnishings space niche over Amazon. They invested significantly in a 3PL fulfillment model called Castlegate, which charges their suppliers to fulfill orders from Wayfair’s own FC’s but ensures speed, quality, service, and sales ranking - similar to the Amazon FBA recipe, but for larger, bulkier home furnishings items. Wayfair has 12 or more of these facilities in the USA that they were opened over the course of the last 5 years. These are not inexpensive to operate, especially in the beginning as Wayfair focused on expanding FC coverage incurring significant costs, while adding vendors to scale the model and reach profitability. I believe the worst is behind Wayfair on this Castlegate program as they have now reached a peak number of FC’s and strong vendor adaptation - it would be wise to look at Castlegate as a competitive advantage going forward that will lead to higher revenues and drive profitability as Wayfair turns to its vendors to foot the FC bills.  Wayfair advertising - they offer a very robust top shelf advertising program that allows their vendors multiple ways to fund advertising and interact with Wayfair base end users. Again, following in the footsteps of Amazon, digital advertising and PPC models generate at least 15% of Amazon's overall revenues. This is a very high margin business because it uses technology to scale revenue growth. I have personally used and engaged with Wayfairs digital advertising program. It is very good and on par with industry standards for a niche e-commerce retailer when you compare it to the likes of Amazon. Very few competitors in this space offer a similar platform: Amazon, Overstock, and Wayfair, and Wayfair's platform is on par.  Lastly, Wayfair added to the cost cutting measures by two rounds of layoffs - once in 2022 for a 5% global workforce reduction and then again at the start of 2024 for about 13% of their global workforce. In the most recent rounds, on January 19th, Wayfair laid off 13% of its corporate workforce which will result in an estimated 260M in annual cost reductions straight to their bottom line for 2024.  I believe this recent round of layoffs will not impact revenue growth as we are seeing a shift in corporate culture across the board from a resource abundant environment to one that is more lean and mean. Their revenues in 2023 vs 2022 were unimpacted with the 5% layoff in 2022. We are seeing this type of cost cutting behavior all around us in our own places of business and/or by knowing someone who has been recently laid off from big tech.  There are several additional cost cutting levers Wayfair can pull if needed, such as reducing advertising expenses (TV ads, Google Adwords), additional rounds of layoffs, and more. Not to mention their recent switch to Vendor funded returns - meaning the vendor now foots the bill when there is something wrong with the customer's order - this is a new initiative they launched mid-2023 that will result in further savings to their bottom line.  **So here’s my bottom line…**  Wayfair is expected to report revenue for the 2023 Q4 quarter on February 22nd. I believe revenue will beat analyst estimates as research shows this will likely be the case (I audited dozens of websites, including Seeking Alpha, and independent analyst reports). I believe we will start to see the positive effect to Net Income from these significant cost cutting measures coupled with further benefits from scaling Castlegate and Digital Advertising programs that will be hitting their bottom line. At the very least, these subjects will be discussed on the revenue call with some additional insight and cost-cutting feedback from management that will trigger further institutional buying.  The icing on the cake is the short squeeze opportunity. With 26% of the stock being shorted, we could see exponential movements to the upside if Wayfair delivers a robust earnings call on 2/22 as anticipated and the stock approaches $60+ as short sellers scramble to purchase stock in the open market to close out their short positions.  Of course there are some risk factors - for instance, global macro economic conditions worsening, and the risk of a market correction triggered by negative earnings reports next week from the likes of behemoths like NIVIDIA, WALMART, and HOME DEPOT to name a few...  **Edit 2/19:**   Chart is looking really good.

"Why I Believe Nvidia Will Continue To Grow For The Remainder of 2024";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1aq5f1p/why_i_believe_nvidia_will_continue_to_grow_for/";"The Santa Clara, California-based company controls about 80% of high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock market value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than tripled in 2023.  As of February 13, 2024 Nvidia has a P/E ratio of 95.24 which may seem high and it totally is understandable. Company seems overweight, compared to competitors such as Intel who have or P/E ratio of 107.63 or AMD 326.41. Compared to competitors they are not as over valued.   Lets compare Nvidia with other companies around its market cap. Amazon has a P/E ratio of 58.16. The difference between Amazon and Nvidia is Nvidia is bound for more growth in the near future with the boom of AI which they control the AI chip market by a crazy 80%. What about their financials, last quarter Nvidia had 18.12 Total Revenue with a net income of 9.24 billion. Amazon had 143.08 billion with net income of 9.88 billion. Nvidia has a huge profit margin of 51.01% compared to Amazon's measly  6.9%. No doubt Amazon is trying to create a bigger net profit margin but so would Nvidia.   Recently Canada had signed a letter of intent to engage in business with Nvidia. Recent CEO Huang discussed that not only is Canada prioritizing AI infrastructure but also Japan, France, South Korea, Malaysia, Italy and Britain. This tells us that countries want to buy these chips from producers around the world which Nvidia are currently leading. Only problem is supply chain issues.  With this kind of demand meeting supply is dificult. Hopefully Nvidia is able to capitalize this and meet this enormous demand with increased prices to maximize revenue.  Nvidia is setting foot in creating energy efficient computing for AI. They are making custom chips for clients such as Meta, Amazon, etc... To become more efficient in specific needs for each clients. This opens up multiple new paths for increased revenue. Not just that Nvidia is creating Gpu's for the consumers which compute the power for AI, of course enough power to game and design.  \---**Major current buyers:**  * **Cloud giants:**    * **Meta:** A major spender, reportedly purchasing billions of dollars worth of H100 chips for their Metaverse ambitions and AI development.    * **Microsoft:** Another big investor, aiming to power cloud services and its Azure AI platform with Nvidia's tech.    * **Amazon:** Utilizing Nvidia chips for their AWS cloud services and internal AI endeavors.    * **Google:** While Google develops its own AI chips, they also leverage Nvidia's technology for specific applications. * **Tech companies:**    * **Baidu:** China's tech giant is reportedly a significant buyer, using Nvidia chips for AI research and development.    * **Tencent:** Another Chinese tech player heavily invested in AI, likely utilizing Nvidia's chips for various projects.    * **Alibaba:** Their spending details are less transparent, but they're likely in the mix due to their extensive AI efforts.    * **Dell:** As a major PC and server manufacturer, they incorporate Nvidia GPUs in their offerings, contributing to Nvidia's sales.  \---**Potential future buyers:**  * **Other cloud providers:** Companies like IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud could increasingly turn to Nvidia chips for their AI offerings. * **Startups and smaller companies:** As AI gains traction in various industries, adoption of Nvidia's technology by smaller players is expected to grow. * **Governments:** For projects in areas like national security, healthcare, and research, governments could become significant buyers.  \---**Global reach, with limitations:**  * Nvidia does aim for widespread sales, reaching numerous countries across the globe. They have customers in various regions, including North America, Europe, Asia, and more.  \---**Export controls and restrictions:**  * However, Nvidia needs to adhere to export control regulations set by the US government, where they're headquartered. These regulations might restrict sales to specific countries or for certain uses.  **Examples of restrictions:**  * In October 2023, the US implemented restrictions on selling their most advanced AI chips to China, aiming to prevent their use for military or other sensitive applications. * Similar restrictions might apply to other countries in the future, depending on evolving policies. * Such restrictions can reduce sales but they weren't selling much to China either way. Now they sell chips with slightly less computing power.  **Upcoming potential announcements (based on rumors and speculations):**  * **GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs:** While not officially confirmed, new consumer graphics cards are expected sometime in 2024 or 2025, likely offering further performance boosts for gamers. * **Next-gen DRIVE autonomous vehicle platform:** Nvidia's self-driving technology is constantly evolving, and the next iteration of the DRIVE platform might bring significant advancements. * **New AI chips:** Beyond the recently released H100, Nvidia is likely working on even more powerful and specialized AI chips for various applications.  With the H200 coming second quarter of 2024.  The biggest worries are geopolitical tensions and export restrictions. Do what you will with this info regards.

"If you missed the NVDA train, buy ARM";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1b8499a/if_you_missed_the_nvda_train_buy_arm/";"Summary: I fully expect Nvidia and Jensen Huang to go after ARM and acquire a (rather large) stake at any moment, possibly as soon as lockup expires next week. If Trump wins election and FTC changes leadership, Nvidia will likely try to acquire ARM outright.   Background: In late September 2020, [Nvidia announced plans to acquire ARM from Softbank](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-for-40-billion-creating-worlds-premier-computing-company-for-the-age-of-ai) for $40 billion. At that time, NVDA was \~ $400 billion company, 10x the value of ARM. In December 2021, the [FTC sues to block the merger](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-sues-block-40-billion-semiconductor-chip-merger) citing anti-competitive advantages the combined firm would do in the AI race. On February 2022, Nvidia and Softbank announce [the termination of Nvidia acquitition of ARM Holdings](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-softbank-group-announce-termination-of-nvidias-acquisition-of-arm-limited) and Softbank immediately announced plans to IPO ARM. ARM would IPO in September of 2023.   All the major tech companies in the world (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom, AMD, META, Tesla, and many many others) are working to design their own chips, most are based on [ARM architecture](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/11/09/how-arm-gained-chip-dominance-with-apple-nvidia-amazon-and-qualcomm.html) and Jensen Huang sees the writing on the wall. Jensen also knows that his main competitors, including some of the big boys, are also champing at the bit to either get their own stake or prevent Nvidia from cornering the entire market outright. It's a race against the inevitable.   If Nvidia was successful in acquiring ARM back in 2021, those $40 billion NVDA shares would be worth $220 billion to Softbank today if we go by the 10x valuation metric that both Nvidia and Softbank likely agreed upon back in 2020.

"Are we in a super bubble? An analysis of the magnificent 7";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18lrfdp/are_we_in_a_super_bubble_an_analysis_of_the/";"So first we we recognize that 7 stocks are driving all growth. Nvidia Tesla Meta Microsoft Amazon Apple Google  And we can we can see these companies don't all things in common, but they have a few things.  Platform monopolies: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon. These companies all have monopolies and no one cares and can continue to die wherever they want to print money  Risks:  Google lost their app store monopoly lawsuit   Amazon loses money to run an unprofitable retail business to get a monopoly. Everyone else has comparable offerings to AWS.  Meta and Google: these are social media plays. The easiest way to destroy America or influence it's politics is via Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube. Foreign governments and local politicians all dump money into these platforms to cause civil unrest and pollute minds.  Risks: Eventually America might actually fall and social media won't be useful anymore. Alternatively, America will topple the governments of the countries doing this, such as Russia and China. Low risk of either outcome.  Nvidia and Tesla. Enron style financial scams. These companies play financial shell games and provide lines of credit to shell companies and broke customers so they can buy their products on paper and manipulate their product prices upwards. Thankfully, Enron ran for almost a decade before it blew up and these companies have only a few years of shady finances, 5 at most for Telsa and less for Nvidia. They may blow up, but not today and not tomorrow.  Risks: the super profitable Enron schemes blow up sooner for Nvidia and Tesla than they did for Enron and we enter the second dotcom burst.  As we can see, all of the magnificent 7 are going to print money for the foreseeable future, at least another 5-10 years until a radical wins office and does major overalls of the systems that allow these companies to be super profitable.";"0";"2023-12-19T03:59:42"
"Have your boomer parents or uber started talking about NVDA, AI? Is it time exit this ride.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bztupp/have_your_boomer_parents_or_uber_started_talking/";"Preface this with I'm a big NVDA AI fan been on the AI train for years before this  2 years ago when NVDA was under $300 I said they really have no peer in this space. I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price.  https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/  I was playing golf at my club and guys who were 60+ on the tee box were talking nvda and smci and everything they said was wrong.  Then I walked into the restaurant to eat and again I heard the boomer pro talking about it. Funny thing was I remember him dogging on it when it was sub 200 having too high a PE  I had a plan and my limit order sold at 900 awhile back but when my mom asked about NVDA I just had that sinking feeling like she asked my about my decentralized currency when it hit ath but my limit order had not filled .  I remember her asking about my currency around nov 2021 at thanksgiving which was literally the top, and again at thxgiving or christmas years prior in 2013 and 2017 she again called the top.  Bless her but my mom and boomers have a way of warning about the top.  EDIT: I just think it’s way harder for a company like NVDA which owns 99% of datacenter GPU to keep that 99% and I already seeing AMD, QCOM, ARM, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, Meta making their own and making in roads and chipping 1% here and there.    Much like any IT person who worked in datacenters and colocations pre 2016 saw INTC own 99% of datacenter.  It was easy to see it’s very hard to keep 99% and when you lose a few % the “street” or “market” pivots quickly.    5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 I said INTC would start shedding that 99% dominance.    https://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/  When you own 99% of the market imo once the pivot happens, it’s almost like a landslide in stock price. And it moves in cycles, companies will buy a bunch of NVDA GPUs and they might add a little bit the next year or the year after but you won’t have large purchases.  No one is buying 1 billion dollars of GPUs every year or quarter.  This business cycles and when it goes down it’ll go down for 2 years and rocket up after when people need to bulk order.";"1429";"2024-04-09T16:41:17"

"Pinterest (PINS) Analysis";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1am4k1h/pinterest_pins_analysis/";"For the next analysis we will be looking at Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) earnings. Pinterest is an image and aesthetic sharing platform popular among younger users. There are many positives about this stock, but certain events lead me to have skepticism. With that being said, let’s dive into the analysis and see where the stock could potentially head post earnings and in the future.   Description:   Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) is an image and idea sharing platform founded in 2008. It operates on the idea of being a visual discovery engine allowing users to find new aesthetics, recipes, etc. This allows for ample advertising opportunity, as companies can obtain ad space on the website for products. Recently the company obtained a deal with Amazon where they get a portion of sales revenue generated from users interacting with Amazon ads. This has sparked renewed interest in the company as this deal is expected to generate increasing revenues and give opportunity for expansion with other brands. There have been rumors that Pinterest is in talks with Google to expand the brand partnerships, similar to what they are doing with Amazon which could be a great sign for the stock. But a lackluster performance from Snapchat puts a shadow on the upcoming performance from Pinterest. The largest fear is that ad spend is being sent to larger companies like Meta, which was my fear with SNAP.   Financial Breakdown:  LTM Price Increase: $25.88 – $40.63 (+57.00%) Users: Q3 2023 – 482MM | Q2 2023 – 462MM  Revenue increase: +11.49% YoY Q3 and +7.8% Q2-Q3 Competitors: Facebook (META), Twitter, Tiktok  Earnings:  Q3 Reported EPS: $0.28 (+40.42% delta from expected) | Q3 Reported Revenue: $763.2MM (+2.67% delta)  Stock Move: Stock jumped +26.11% after earnings  Q4 Expected EPS: $0.51 | Q4 Expected Revenue: $990.19B  Verdict:   With Pinterest reporting earnings after market close on February 8th, all eyes will be on the health of advertising within the company’s revenue. This earnings release will be a big one, but the stock will either booming or completely cratering. The way I see it there are two realities, is Pinterest similar to Meta or Snapchat. In my honest opinion, this stock has a long way to go to be compared to Meta. Although both companies share a portion of their revenues to advertising, Pinterest lacks the products and AI infrastructure needed to provide a stable revenue stream. Although the deal with Amazon is good, Snapchat also shares a very similar deal where customers can purchase directly through their app. Because of the vast similarities in how Pinterest produces revenue, I lack the faith to purchase any long positions in the stock. This all comes in the face of a +30% increase since November.    Prior to providing my opinion, I must preface with a disclosure that options trading is extremely risky and losing all your money is a very real possibility and that this is not financial advice. Whether you elect to agree with my personal decision is entirely up to you, and this post is simply intended to provide more information into the company. As we head into the report, I expect the management team to try and talk about AI influencing/optimizing the ads and products shown to customers. I believe they will be right around the earnings expectations because of holiday spending, but like Snapchat I think there will be concerns about guidance and ad spend. In my own portfolio, I AM STEERING CLEAR ON THIS STOCK. Historically, the stock has seen a ~13% move in either direction post earnings and I don’t expect this to be any different. I originally purchased 1 call contract but after looking deeper into the company, and the fact that insiders have sold the stock recently, I can’t help but think about this logically. The closest competitor, Snapchat vastly underperformed and provided terrible guidance. This, on top of insider selling makes me think the market is anticipating a downward move. A director within the company (Jeffrey Jordan) has been selling 20,000 shares a month this quarter which is very concerning. Even if they beat I think the stock will move downwards because of this reason. But again, anything is possible so a move upward could happen if they announce a partnership with Google and mention efficiency improving levers. If I had to pick a direction, I would anticipate an approximate 10% move downward so $41 puts would look inciting where the break even piece would be at $38.00, prices we haven’t seen since a whopping 1.5 weeks ago. All in all, I am sitting this one out because I see better opportunities in the market.  We have two more earnings to play this week (AFRM, Cloudfare) so expect to see one more post like this one. I won’t be doing an in depth play on Cloudfare but purchased calls. Please leave a like and comment if you want to see more. Good luck!";"26";"2024-02-08T20:54:36"

"META rumored to be working on becoming the AWS of AI workloads";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ay74ft/meta_rumored_to_be_working_on_becoming_the_aws_of/";"Hi everyone.  So my fund has a large position in META and so, to confess, I am talking my book here.  However, facts are that Zuck will, by the end of 2024, have purchases over 350,000 Nvidia H100 AI computers and will proprietary build another 300,000 H100 equivalent compute nodes.  He has stated that here: [https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/290456847348165/](https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/290456847348165/)  Why all the AI compute?  Rumor has it (and from a very reliable source also), that META's goal here is to become the AWS (Amazon Web Services) of AI compute for all large and small companies. META currently offers their LLaMA open source language model to the developer community for AI model development.  Why open source versus closed proprietary models like ChatGTP?   Perhaps so that the ultimate developed AI workload can run on the META hyperscale worldwide redundant server network - thus explaining the massive H100 infrastructure build currently being deployed.  Proprietary language models like ChatGTP must be rented as a service and cannot be used for custom AI development instances.  Most large entities and governments will want custom AI compute, and in many cases multiple instances of AI compute for different tasks (defense, crime fighting, tax collections, etc).  Remember AWS is worth, by many estimates, more than Amazon's retail e-commerce division.    What will META be worth when they are the primary provider of AI hosted infrastructure to start-ups, consumers, small and large businesses and world governments?  Probably well over $3000 per share - and this increase in share price will occur rapidly within the next 3 years should it become evident META is becoming the AWS of AI.   META remains, despite its recent massive run up, the cheapest of the mega-cap tech stocks (and in an election year advertising environment also....).  So this is still a largely secret program at META (why let potential competitors like AWS know their strategy ahead of time).  But, once announced, expect further gains in META's equity valuation - perhaps very substantial gains.  Interested in others thoughts on this.  Thanks";"39";"2024-02-23T19:00:33"

"🚀AMD Earnings: Time to Hit it Big";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17kq09i/amd_earnings_time_to_hit_it_big/";"So last week [I gave you guys AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17h0sy7/amazon_earnings_the_boomer_play_that_could_print/), the stock went up 7% after earnings and calls printed big time. An absolute banger. Now this week, let me show you what's in store for AMD and look at how we can make money on earnings tonight. Are we gonna see an earnings beat that sends us to the moon, or is it time to deploy the 💩 emojis?  Whether its autonomous vehicles, entertainment, or healthcare, AMD’s processors are powering people and businesses at a cutting-edge level. Yup, that's right: this chip titan's tech is in everything from your mom's car to the PS5 you can't afford. And the company will look to demonstrate how broad its reach is when it reports third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings results after the closing bell Tuesday. We'll want to look to see whether AMD's streak of earnings beats can continue: working in AMD's favor is the noticeable rebound in global PC shipments suggesting that a recovery in the global PC market could be underway.   In the most recent quarter, worldwide PC shipments totaled 59.7 million units, marking an almost 17% decrease year over year. But that decline is showing signs of stabilization, [including sequential growth from the previous quarter](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/04-11-2023-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-declined-30-percent-in-first-quarter-of-2023), noted Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa. “The rate of decline in the PC market has slowed, indicating that shipment volumes may have reached their lowest point,” said Kitagawa, then adding, “There has been progress in reducing PC inventory after more than a year of issues, supported by a gradual increase in business PC demand."" In other words: we've hit rock bottom and it's only up from here. With PCs no longer in freefall, AMD's got a shot at keeping its stock price soaring.   Meanwhile, AMD stock, which is up 48% year to date, while the S&P 500's playing catch-up with a measly 7%. This is because even amid the PC decline challenges or past issues related to supply chains, the company demonstrates strong operating leverage evidenced by its ability to grow profits at a faster rate than its revenue. Assuming the company’s growth metrics rebound in Q3, along with strong guidance, AMD stock will continue to rise despite its recent outperformance. This company can turn a profit faster than you can say ""capital gains tax.""  The pencil pushers over at wall street are predicting 64 cents per share in earnings on $5.37 billion in revenue. Compare that to 67 cents and $5.62 billion last year, and you've got yourself some bearish vibes. But remember, CEO Lisa Su has hinted at a more bullish $5.7 billion revenue mark. AI demand alone could make this a $150 billion market by 2027.  Artificial intelligence will continue to push the semiconductor industry, and will really help AMD well into 2024 and so on. In the meantime, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann sees the data center's strength helping AMD, especially their new MI300A/X APU/GPU compute accelerators, which could blast Wall Street's expectations. For those who don't know, he's referring specifically to their accelerated processing units and graphics processing units. More on these products later.   Regulations on tech exports to China could be a curveball, but the longer-term outlook is good. PC demand is set to return by 2024, and the GPU market could grow by a crazy 34% annually over the next five years. This is as the data center industry is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 10.5% through 2030.  In the near term, AMD's management needs to tackle the chip industry's cyclical nature, but they've done it before. In the second quarter, the company beat on both the top and bottom lines by a penny, while Q2 revenue of $5.36 billion topped estimates by $40 million. This is despite the 18% year-over-year decline.  The beat was driven by 16% rise in the Embedded segment, which offset declines in Datacenter, Gaming and Client. During the quarter, operating income swung to a loss of $20 million from a year-ago gain of $526 million. But I expect AMD’s segment growth metrics to rebound in Q3. I'm fairly sure margin pressures have bottomed and are now ready for expansion. Assuming this comes with strong guidance for the holiday quarter. Here, AMD stock will continue to rise even with its recent outperformance.  KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh slapped a $160 price target and an 'overweight' rating, because he sees this rocket fuelling up for a late-year lift-off. He mentions, ""Despite modest risk to 4Q guidance given the pushout of MI300A volumes and a more measured Genoa ramp, investors will likely look through any near-term miss in anticipation of a December MI300X launch event and Microsoft onstage endorsement, providing a clear catalyst for the stock into the end of the year.""  As traders, will should also look for a detailed impact from expanded restrictions on the sale of advanced technologies to China, unveiled earlier this month by U.S. Trade Secretary Gina Raimondo.  The new restrictions, which expand upon new export rules put in place last year, are designed to limit China's access to ""advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to (Chinese) military applications,"" Raimondo said.  China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs described those efforts as ""economic coercion and sci-tech bullying"" earlier this year and described the moves as ""against the principles of market economy and fair competition.""  **AMD's Products**  During this last quarter, AMD expanded its FPGA portfolio with the launch of the Alveo UL3524 accelerator card. This is designed for ultra-low latency electronic trading applications. The latest state-of-the-art FPGA solution will help the company expand its footprint in the fintech domain. Fucking amazing.   AMD also expanded its portfolio with the launch of Kria K24 System-on-Module (SOM) and KD240 Drives Starter Kit. The K24 SOM features a custom-built Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC device and the supporting KD240 starter kit is a sub-$400 FPGA-based motor control kit.  They also continued by expanding its fourth-generation EPYC CPU portfolio with the launch of 8004 series processors. These are based on Zen 4c core and a new SP6 socket. For those who don't know, the EPYC 8004 series processors can provide up to two times better SPEC power performance (per system watt) compared with the closest competition. Computerphiles believe that AMD’s EPYC 8004 series processors deliver balanced performance and excellent energy efficiency that is required at the edge.  In addition to this, AMD unveiled the new Radeon RX 7800 XT and Radeon RX 7700 XT. Anyone in the gaming space? These new graphics cards are optimized to deliver incredibly high-performance, high-refresh 1440p gaming experiences for AAA and esports titles. The company also announced the availability of AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3, the next generation of the popular upscaling technology that is designed to offer massive performance boosts in supported games.  And not even that long ago, in August, AMD announced that Amazon Web Services has expanded its 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor-based offerings with the general availability of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) M7a and Amazon EC2 Hpc7a instances.  Moreover, AMD announced two new additions to the Radeon PRO W7000 series product line, the Radeon PRO W7600 and Radeon PRO W7500 workstation graphics cards.  **What do the other Analysts Say?**  * “We expect slight upside to third-quarter results and a largely in-line-with-consensus fourth-quarter outlook. We believe PC tracked slightly better and data center tracked in line. We are modeling $300-400 million contribution from MI300 GPU in the fourth quarter, primarily from El Capitan supercomputer, which is a one-time project.” — Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri  * “AMD’s calendar third-quarter estimates should be achievable, particularly assuming some benefit from improving consumer PC shipments. The risk rather, in our view, is CQ4 (and perhaps CQ1). The ramp of El Capitan should provide AMD some momentum: however, we are less clear that AMD can hit elevated expectations, which we believe will eventually require better server CPU shipments in light of continued weakness in cloud-service-provider spend.” — Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson  * “The AMD narrative feels all about their datacenter (and, particularly, their AI story) right now. In the near term the achievability of their second-half datacenter growth (guided to 50% half over half) will be the question (we think the growth into year-end is plausible as most of it is likely from El Capitan but Q1 estimates may bear some watching), though CPU share as Genoa finally hit crossover will also be top of mind.” — Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon  **What to do for Earnings**  Given everything that I've read so far, I'm sure calls are the way to go here. I'll be getting AMD 11/03 100c @ 2.58, the stock will need a ~5% rise to break even. I expect this and more. Keep in mind, this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too. On Wednesday, we have ROKU, PYPL, and ABNB. And of course on Thursday, we have PLTR, SHOP, AAPL, COIN, DKNG, and SQ. I'll probably be making two more posts this week.";"349";"2023-10-31T18:10:48"

"Celsius DD pt.2 An Even Deeper Dive into the Company";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1b8x6pi/celsius_dd_pt2_an_even_deeper_dive_into_the/";"After my CELH [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1b84zhr/why_i_believe_celsius_is_ready_to_make_an_smci/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) yesterday, I did an even deeper dive into the company. The more I read about the company the more I fell in love with it.  After listening to the [Odd Lots Podcast with the CEO of Celsius](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2024-03-06/odd-lots-celsius-ceo-on-how-to-win-in-energy-drinks-podcast) this morning, I just couldn't help but write another DD post.  The podcast is definitely worth a listen if you are interested in the company like I am. I don't expect you to read all of this but some really interesting points as to why this company is making big waves in their industry.  &#x200B:  \- Partnered with Pepsi a year ago as their distribution partner which really expanded the availability with Celsius to where they are today. They can be found in 98% of retail stores.  \- There are about 5,000 new brands in the beverage industry that come to market each year. About 10% of those will make it to 100 million in sales. Another 10% of those will make it to like 1 million. In very rare cases will any of them make it to 1 billion in sales. Its a very highly competitive market.  \- Celsius ""Live Fit"" is their mantra. Their drinks include green tea, ginger, chromium, vitamin C, B complex. A lot of great vitamins. It's almost like a multi-vitamin in a can. This positions Celsius as this, healthy better for you segment. When speaking with distributors, there has been a void because it has always been sugar energy drinks within their portfolio and Celsius was offering this better for you energy drink especially coming out of this post covid world when everyone is thinking about their health, wellness and their fitness.  \- One thing in a retail space, especially in the energy category, you really only have in some cases 45 days to perform on shelf otherwise you are out. Another hint at a highly competitive and highly difficult market. It is hard to compete in todays energy drink category and in beverage because it is dominated by really strong brands that are out there and Celsius has been able to really rise to the top as they are now the third largest energy drink brand right now in the United States. They have over a 10 share in the entry category for the first time and just getting 1 share is practically near impossible.  \- The billboard effect is super critical. You need to get that billboard effect. When they started, Target as an example, when they went nationally into Target they only had 2 flavors authorized that were on the warm shelf. Every year after that, because of the increase in sales, they were able to build onto that and get authorized an additional flavor to be added into the Target sets. Once they got to about 5 flavors in Target, they were able to create this sort of billboard or Celsius brand on shelf which started to be incremental. When they added another flavor, it didn't cannibalize their sales, it increased their sales because more consumers can see the product because they created that billboard. Today, in a wide variety of stores around the country you can find Celsius at the front check out coolers and additional cold placements throughout the store.  \- They're still in the honeymoon phase with Pepsi because they are only 1 year in, but they are gaining distribution, gaining additional displays and working with them collaboratively for the first time this year planning 2 years in advance to be included in national priorities and national execution programs. This partnership is just getting started.  \- Their strategy is to leverage the Pepsi Co distribution network and their resources and team members to further bring their brand to more people and consumers. They will do what we do best which is the sales and marketing component and bringing great tasting innovative energy drinks to market.  \- They're launching a trilogy and going inter galactic with galaxy vibe and astro vibe with 2 new flavors this year.  \- If you go on Amazon right now and type in Celsius, the second ad you get is a Monster Energy drink. Celsius is flattered by the fact that Monster is buying ads against their consumer and fans searching for Celsius. Celsius is actually bringing new consumers into the healthy energy world. They have been the largest true growth driver in the community.  \- **CELSIUS IS THE NUMBER 1 SELLING ENERGY DRINK ON AMAZON AND THEY ARE ROUGHLY 20 SHARE OF THE WHOLE ENERGY CATEGORY ON AMAZON. WHEN YOU LOOK AT AMAZON, THAT IS A REALLY LOYAL CONSUMER BASE, SOMEONE IS SPENDING OVER $20 TO PURCHASE A 12 PACK OF A WARM BEVERAGE THAT HAS TO WAIT FOR IT TO BE SHIPPED TO THEIR HOUSE, PUT IN THE REFRIGERATOR AND CHILLED TO DRINK IT AS A DAILY ROUTINE OR LIFESTYLE. IT REALLY SHOWS YOU THE LOYALTY THEY HAVE WITH THE CELSIUS PORTFOLIO THAT EVEN WITH THE DISTRIBUTION GAINS AND INCREASED AVAILABILITY WITH PEPSI PARTNERSHIP, THEY'VE BEEN PRETTY MUCH BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR SHARE NUMBERS AND GROWTH TRAJECTORY ON AMAZON. ALL TIDES ARE RISING AS DISTRIBUTION GAINS SHOWING THAT CELSIUS IS ALIGNED WITH TODAYS HEALTH MODERN CONSUMER.**  \- They mentioned Jake Paul, MLS and they also just partnered with Ferrari with F1. As they begin broader distribution and a broader consumer base they want to remain true to fitness and they were just at the Arnold Classic, the largest fitness show in the US. They had Arnold drinking a galaxy vibe at the event. They are all about the athletes and inner athletes. MLS is a great partnership for them as you have the World Cup coming to North America so the timing of that can be great. Maintaining the brand's authenticity is extremely important to Celsius.  \- Celsius consumers are increasing their consumption, so a can or 2 a day. Flavor innovation is really exciting but they do see their consumers staying within the portfolio so they try to harmonize the flavors so they have similar flavors within the line. When you look at the flavor profiles, some flavors will be in and out gaining new consumers into the portfolio.  \- The CEOs favorite flavor is lemon lime. Super refreshing, crisp and sort of tastes like sprite which is interesting. With the Pepsi partnership, it further opened up and expanded Celsius into food service which launched them into Jersey Mikes and Dunkin' Donuts (3,000 stores) but what they are seeing is the Celsius consumer is consuming Celsius with a meal. Traditional energy drinks are seen as an appetite suppressant where Celsius is seen as a soda/juice replacement that people could drink during their meals. Retailers like this because they report back that consumers are indeed buying their food and snacks with their Celsius.  \- The CEO says that their product DOES NOT contain any ingredient that is found in Ozempic. That was a Tik Tok thing BUT has said that it compliments people dieting or on Ozempic well because of the zero sugar, low on the glycemic index and all of the additional vitamins.  There is a lot more that has been said but that's pretty much the summary of the podcast.  &#x200B:  [I even bought another case after listening lol](https://preview.redd.it/zselts9eixmc1.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b0eab77fd646e733bd70115e194d08ba69378fd)  &#x200B:  Position remains the same for now: 11 $125 CELH calls for 4/19 that I plan on holding until 4/19.

UBS, for example, initiated a target price of $8 per share for Rivian stock following its Feburary earnings.  Rivian's shameless CEO last quarter blamed high interest rates for reducing 2024 vehicle production expectations, and even reduced the workforce by 10%. Their R1T truck model loses 30K per vehicle manufactured when they charge customers 75K.  The company does not have any partnership with charging station companies, and announced in November 2023 that existing partnerships with Amazon have ceased.  Despite being correct about the outcome for Netflix's most recent post earnings stock price action, my dad is seriously married to a doomed investment due to a serious case of Fomo. He claimed that the stock was the 'Next Tesla' when he brought shares at 150 and said that it 'would be about 5 years before the investment matures' after the stock fell to 30 a share.  Pls buy the 9.5 strike weekly expiry put option on Rivian, interest rates will be coming down slower than expected and the CEO has already begun the process of pushing promising talent out of the company.";"18";"2024-05-07T05:33:35"

This is **WallstreetBETS**, not Wallstreet-I'm-a-little-bitch-bet.  Big boys in this subreddit didn't get big by making conservative plays. They did it by making some absolutely bonkers plays that were high risk and the majority of you smooth-brain fucks can't see.  Goodluck and if you're so adamant on it being garbage, please short or buy puts -- otherwise, suck my chode.   ---- Original post ----   **Financial Performance:** BlackBerry Ltd. ($BB) is on fire, and I mean a big ass dumpster fire. People say, ""Blazing a trail of growth and stability as it transforms from hardware to software and services"" which is hard to convince investors, or any other financial crowd, given their recent performance. Their latest quarter, BlackBerry reported revenue of $259 million, actually seeing a 10% increase YoY. The software and services revenue, now the core revenue driver, surged 17% YoY to $215 million, which is actually surprising for them. They have a debt/revenue ratio of .3 which is a good spot to be in for leveraging upcoming shifts in the financial space   **Cybersecurity and IoT Focus:** BlackBerry's strategic pivot towards cybersecurity and IoT is the only reason they're not fucked. Everybody is fucking up your shit and Media keeps hyping the absurdness of scamming lately, and while that's FUD for my brain while I drink my coffee, organizations are doubling down on cybersecurity investments to bolster their traditional cyber-security backing. BlackBerry's cybersecurity offerings, including endpoint security, encryption, and threat detection, are positioned to ride this wave of demand. They have a good point to ride a wave on the regarded Boom of AI if they mention they are able to branch into new AI related protections.   Just to be frank: In the IoT arena, BlackBerry ain't trash... and with the world being digitized more everyday, their market share is not capping out anytime soon.   **Partnerships and Acquisitions:** BlackBerry isn't just playing the game: it's buttfucking the rules and generating a new set of Uno cards to pull out in a pinch. They've had a *few* strategic partnerships & acquisitions. BlackBerry is expanding its product portfolio and market reach. Their Alliance w/ Amazon Web Services (AWS) to develop and market BlackBerry's intelligent vehicle data platform, IVY, is a integrated in every fucking car. Good luck getting the fuck away from IVY. Bitch'll make you itch. This partnership not only validates BlackBerry's technology but also opens doors to the lucrative automotive industry, a hotbed for IoT innovations. Their core partnerships include:   ***Partnerships***: **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: BlackBerry partnered with AWS to develop and market the BlackBerry IVY intelligent vehicle data platform, targeting the automotive industry. **Baidu**: BlackBerry partnered with Baidu to integrate its QNX technology into Baidu's open-source autonomous driving platform, Apollo. Acquisitions:  **Cylance**: In 2018, BlackBerry acquired Cylance, an artificial intelligence and cybersecurity company, to enhance its cybersecurity capabilities. **Good Technology**: BlackBerry acquired Good Technology, a provider of secure mobility solutions, in 2015, to strengthen its position in the enterprise mobility market. **WatchDox**: BlackBerry acquired WatchDox, a secure file-sharing company, in 2015, to enhance its enterprise security offerings.    **Potential for Growth and Innovation:** Let's be real -- Blackberry is the gardener, floating face down in the pond while the big boys eat caviar, spoon fed by their advanced AI sex-bots. But, If that Gardener survives, the lawsuit to make sure that he doesn't disclose all the other wild shit they've seen at Steevie McQueefies house, well -- that'd be enough to float this bad boy right back into relevancy, *metaphorically of course*. At their current financial performance, strategic focus on cybersecurity and IoT, and partnerships with industry giants, BlackBerry is trying to prepare for upwards growth and innovation. As businesses prioritize digital transformation and security, BlackBerry stands poised to capture a lion's share of these burgeoning markets.  **Risk Factors:** I mean -- we know what the fuck. They ain't been great the last decade: despite its recovering performance, intense competition in the cybersecurity and IoT markets *could* dampen its growth. Additionally, BlackBerry's fortunes are closely tied to the economic landscape, with fluctuations potentially impacting IT spending by businesses. That being said, These Canadians are going to be the nicest to work with, and will *likely* not spill poutine on your servers.  **General Discussion** The discussion around $BB upcoming quarterly report *seems* to be leaning towards a more bullish sentiment, likely due to several factors, including the company's shift towards software and services, which has always had promising growth. BlackBerry's partnerships and acquisitions in key areas like cybersecurity and IoT have positioned it well for future growth opportunities. Investors may be optimistic about the potential for BlackBerry to deliver strong financial results in the upcoming report, particularly in its software and services segments.  **Conclusion:** In summary, BlackBerry's transformation, strategic focus, and partnerships have set the stage for a potential journey of growth & innovation. With its current financial standing, competitive product portfolio, and market positioning, BlackBerry is a poised to make your portfolio like three fiddy.   Position: Shares and $4C for 04/05. If everything goes to shit... well -- atleast I'll have a bag for her head later that night...";"582";"2024-04-01T19:10:39"

Started in December with just $800 and quickly got addicted to putting my savings in thinking its gonna multiply through easy puts. I honestly wasted all my savings within the first two months not knowing what i was doing, went from $6,800 to $600 to $1,200, and from there starting in March I actually did some good plays day by day on SPY and QQQ. I was calling reversals and everything, but the market also just had a lot of momentum. I reached 14.5k, the most money I've ever had at one time, and thought, dang just $500 more to 15k. I switched from my winning strategy of intraday plays and tried holding UVXY calls, Kroger and Zilllow puts (someone posted here about them) and lost a majority of my money by trying to do the same intraday calls/puts. But in April the market stabilized like crazy, my plays didn't work at all anymore and those puts I had lost so much value. I should have stopped but I got desperate, trying to regain my wealth. Honeslt,y if I had just waited three days and took a break, placed it all in Calls, I would easily have gone above $32k and probably not need to ever touch the market again.  I went to Coachella and missed out on a lot of earnings that i DID want to play, which probably would have boosted me really good. Instead the one Earnings i did play was Amazon. Price went from around 108 to 119 to 102 by open, we all remember that. I stayed outta playing for a bit, got my money up to $700 doing SQQQ puts recently, and then Put in another $300 to buy two Tesla calls at different prices for 7/28. 1k wiped out overnight.   Dumb and stupid choice, I really believed Tesla could break $305. My other friends only played $200-300, buy my dumbass went all in. Seeing 1k again felt so good for a moment. I really dont know what i'm going to do now. I have a lot of debt and basically 0 savings, all my money is just in my checking account going in and out as I get paid. I'm 24 but I feel like a fucking loser cause of all of this. At one point I wanted to take out a $2,500 loan but I was denied.";"592";"2023-07-20T22:54:33"

And in the earnings call they mentioned R2 as the future of the company consistently and frequently. * YoY per-vehicle loss is way down. \~$81k improvement.  * Leasing has begun for R1T and R1S. * Exceeded all aspects of guidance for 2023. * YoY revenue increase of 167%. * Additional, lower-priced variants of the R1. * Lower cost basis with reduction of staff. * Planned 30% plant efficiency in 2H in 2024. * Better partnership with suppliers reduce variable cost per vehicle. * Extremely strong brand, literally the strongest auto brand in 2023 according to Consumer Reports. * Opportunity for additional revenue through subscription model that will offer ongoing improvements to the platform — including entertainment and vehicle capabilities.  * Top selling EV over $70k.  https://preview.redd.it/d781gmber5kc1.png?width=1618&format=png&auto=webp&s=763b91221dff177d970f128dad1e2e69d57a5c08  But, some of that good news also has bad news associated with it. Here's the other side of some double edged swords before getting into the bad, bad news.  * Gross loss per vehicle actually increased QoQ, from a loss of $30,648 per car in Q3 2023 to $43,372 per car in Q4, 2023 (lower deliveries) * Those efficiency gains at the plant and new suppliers mean that the plant has to shut down for several weeks in Q2.  And now the bad, bad news that I don't like.  * Rivian is guiding that they will not produce more vehicles than they produced last year: 57,000. Deliveries can still increase YoY and they'll use existing inventory during that plant shut down, but yeesh. That's not what people want to see. * Deliveries were down in Q4. A lot of people are speculating softer demand for the vehicles overall (which is likely true as RJ himself said that people reserved vehicles with different financing expectations), but I think the real issue here is that Amazon deferred delivery of their EDVs until 2024. It would appear the margins on EDV are preeeetty good and that deferral contributed to their increased gross loss per vehicle. Rivian guided that Q4 will see fewer deliveries for future quarters. * R2 launch is two years away. It's gonna be sorta rough for Rivian until then I think, but hopefully, at worst, pretty flat. * Interest rates are very rough and a lot of Rivian's future demand depends on cutting rates.  https://preview.redd.it/yjnwxp9fr5kc1.png?width=2236&format=png&auto=webp&s=5293608b2b630779a9f8f6a5302278efc325b9d4  That's not a lot of bullet points, but I think it all boils down to those four points overall.   One of the most interesting parts of the Shareholder Letter was why Rivian believes they'll be profitable by Q4 2024: ""We believe our success driving significant reduction in the costs of our vehicles during 2023 positions us to achieve modest gross profit in the Q4 of 2024. The key drivers to bridge the fourth quarter 2023 to the fourth quarter of 2024 are:  *  \~50% - Variable cost per unit  * \~35% - Fixed/semi-fixed cost efficiencies  * \~15% - Non-vehicle revenue""  https://preview.redd.it/a5llfs0gr5kc1.png?width=2222&format=png&auto=webp&s=902051053fcd800ec2301d5b211fb3c5daa11163  I'm still bullish on Rivian. This is a pivotal moment for EVs. And a rough one for autos in general. I think the best thing to do is sit back and wait — and while I maybe didn't enter at the *optimal* time — I think looking at a long term graph 4 years from now will show that it wasn't the worst time. Again, I think so much of this rides on the R2.";"1941";"2024-02-22T16:53:58"

But instead of trading at forward P/E of fucking 40, it trades at 8x earnings. How do I know that this will normalize? I fucking don't! I don't even know if those numbers are accurate. No one does.  I know it has a lot of cash. Like, a ridiculous amount of cash in proportion to its market cap. It could probably use that cash to increase the share price. Will it do this, through the largest dividend and/or share buyback the world has ever seen? FUCK NO. Would their government disappear all the executives if it tried? I don't know, probably. Who cares?  I also know that its valuation has nothing to do with its financials and is entirely based on risk. Geopolitical risk, internal anti-monopoly political risk, tariff and cold war bullshit risk, Chinese economic stagnation risk. Are these real tangible threats to the forward value of Alibaba? I don't know, maybe. Probably. But WGAF?  What matters in investing is stories. A good story wins hearts and minds. And wallets. And Chinese companies, especially BABA, are the most beaten down and unloved garbage on the entire fucking planet. While the whole world rallied around, I don't fucking know, AI or soft landings or things generally not being quite as shitty as everyone expected, China equities have been shittier than anyone has ever seen. Ever. So what am I proposing? A story. A beautiful, heartwarming story. An underdog tale.

"""Why did the Dot Com bubble burst?""";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17m6o83/why_did_the_dot_com_bubble_burst/";""" It’s always difficult to identify a single catalyst that causes the bursting of an asset bubble, but in the case of the internet bubble, two factors seem to have played at least some part in the industry’s rapid decline, which began after the tech-heavy [Nasdaq composite](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/n/nasdaq-composite) peaked on March 10th, 2000.  The first factor was rising interest rates. The [Federal Reserve](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/f/federal-reserve) raised the [fed funds rate](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/f/fed-funds-rate) (which informs most other interest rates) several times over the course of the years 1999 and 2000. Higher interest rates tend to motivate investors to move money out of more speculative assets (like internet company stocks) and into interest-paying assets like bonds.  The second factor was the onset of a [recession](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/r/recession) in Japan in March of 2000. News of this recession spread fast and led to a wave of fear that triggered a worldwide selloff, moving even more money out of speculative equities and into safer, fixed-income instruments like bonds.""  **HMMM, it really seems like this is exactly what's happening now. The FED is going to increase interest rates, which will kill startups. The venture capital will dry up when investors realize that bonds are safer than the stock market. Earnings only look good right now because of inflation, and sky high PE ratios will soar on bad earnings. Hedges will switch strategy to shorting the market once they realize there is more money to be made off of puts than on calls. China is already hitting major economic turmoil which will have global effects. Consumers will not have any money to spend on goods because they all have 20% car loans and 9% mortgages, and their 500 dollar student loan payments just resumed.

I don't want folks tailing me but I DO want y'all to think of me tomorrow when market opens LOL  When this wins, A chunk of these gains will be put towards a bullish Amazon play. That's the only ticker I'm truly confident in next week.  Bear Roll Call! Where you at? What are we dining on tomorrow?";"33";"2024-01-25T22:49:31"
"Possible offer for Paramount PARA";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/19f5udh/possible_offer_for_paramount_para/";"Feasible plan for PARA through a potential  combined  offer with divestirure of assets: Skydance gets the studio Apollo gets the TV stations and broadcasters WDB gets the movie/content catalogue and other . With that it can get a better leverage vs $NFLX and either increase its fee for content sharing or to stop providing content to Netflix. If other providers do the same, it would put NFLX at risk VS Amazon Prime or other streaming platforms which provide specific content with an additional subscription. Sport rights may be a topic of betting war among Apple, NFLX, and others. Specific assets (BET, Showtime...) sold separately.  In such a scenario (which probability?), possible risky play of the pair PARA vs NFLX";"0";"2024-01-25T10:53:08"
"🚨🚨 BP Engineer Hyped on Palantir's Future - Screenshot Reveals 26 App Explosion! 🛢️🔮";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/146yq53/bp_engineer_hyped_on_palantirs_future_screenshot/";"   https://preview.redd.it/sym5sv1uo15b1.jpg?width=834&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c38f6025b2d0e2be659fea6ad20a192340d4ffbe  Okay, here's the scoop. There's a BP engineer who's a daily user and devotee of Palantir's Foundry platform posted an interesting screenshot. He's genuinely blown away by what the software can do. In his eyes, it's reshaping the business landscape, much like iOS did for smartphones.    Even in this rocky economy, Foundry is showing its mettle. It's pushing Palantir's U.S. commercial business to impressive heights, hitting a cool $1 billion annual run rate in just six years. That's some Amazon Web Services (AWS) level growth right there.  The engineer is betting on Foundry to shake things up, and take data and process handling to the next level. More efficiency, more innovation - that's the direction he sees this going.  In his business unit alone, BP is already running 36 applications on Foundry, and that's just the beginning. With new software like AIP on the horizon, he's expecting some solid gains for both BP and Palantir. Exciting times ahead, folks.  https://preview.redd.it/xbca433gs15b1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e40526c38aa3ce4d84a02740ae4b7d63adc21d70";"27";"2023-06-11T18:47:24"
