"Is Apple Honestly Bearish Now?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/15l4s1o/is_apple_honestly_bearish_now/";"$AAPL on a weekly closing basis needs to close above $190 to break a (2) consecutive 5 WEEK rolling negative return...you think it's not a big deal...sure...maybe not but it has been POSITIVE SINCE JANUARY 13th, 2023 (a great time to buy)  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/ka0yh86gqsgb1.png?width=2430&format=png&auto=webp&s=fced0df73f89f099d6edee7f1dcc30f268339618  This was the end of the bottom.

What's important now is that if we close below $190 for APPLE this week...it will be (2 consecutive) weeks starting of negative returns. That's a highly correlated sign to negative returns going forward.  If it's flips to negative...is it time to sell?  The concern with Apple isn't even the change in sentiment. It's the size.  Every single money manager on the planet pays attention to Apple. Most own it, most mutual funds, etfs and sovereign wealth funds own it.  Apple is a safe bet or has been for years. Now things suddenly go south after earnings....fishy.  The environment for Apple's massive growth has changed.  I don't want to ramble but it's important to look at Apple if sentiment changes and boy did thins change.  What do you think? Can this make it? Will this be a reversal this week and we close above $190?  EDIT:  I didn‚Äôt say APPLE üçé was going to zero. I‚Äôm saying the price action has changed for now. It‚Äôs pretty obvious and this isn‚Äôt fundamental research. I get it. But the market is acting different for a reason.";"86";"2023-08-08T04:20:19"

Fast forward now, Apple is $194 and Amazon $133. would it be worth for me to try to buy more Amazon and Apple shares or should I wait until they drop a bit?   Perhaps, should I take the money and buy ETFs or indexes like VOO ?  Your advise will be greatly appreciated.   I started investing back in 2021.   Thanks! ";"11";"2023-07-18T21:29:02"

I know Apple recently tried to expand in the financial sector with its savings account, but does it really think its future lies in banking?

"Apple becomes first U.S. company to reach $3 trillion market cap";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1493cw8/apple_becomes_first_us_company_to_reach_3/";"   * **Apple hit a market cap of $3 trillion briefly during trading on Monday.** * **The milestone is mostly symbolic but it represents investor recognition of Apple‚Äôs success over the past few years as the company has reported several record-breaking quarters of big growth in all of its product lines.** * **Apple‚Äôs cash flow also makes the stock a safe haven during times of market uncertainty.**  Apple briefly hit a market cap of $3 trillion during intraday trading on Monday, before dropping back under the mark shortly afterwards. Apple broke the barrier when its share price hit $182.86.  Apple rose 2.5% on Monday to close at $182.01, just missing closing the trading day at the $3 trillion mark.   The milestone is mostly symbolic but it shows investors remain bullish on Apple stock and its ability to grow. At a market value of $3 trillion, Apple tripled its valuation in under four years. And analysts see plenty of room to run.  Apple showed annual growth across all of its product categories in its fourth-quarter earnings, with revenue up 29% year-over-year. While the iPhone is still the biggest sales driver, Apple‚Äôs services business grew 25.6% year-over-year and delivered more than $18 billion in revenue during the quarter.   In December, for example, Morgan Stanley‚Äôs Katy Huberty raised the firm‚Äôs price target on Apple from $164 to $200, and maintained the equivalent of a buy rating, arguing that new products like virtual reality and augmented reality headsets aren‚Äôt yet baked into the share price.  Huberty also said she expects Apple‚Äôs App Store revenue to outperform Morgan Stanley‚Äôs forecasts for the quarter and for Apple to ship 83 million units during the December quarter, 3 million more than anticipated.  Apple sold 27 million pairs of its newest AirPods model over the holidays, driving 20% year-over-year growth for Apple‚Äôs wearables business during the quarter, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TFI Asset Management Limited said in a Monday note.  Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote on Sunday that the mark is a ‚Äúwatershed moment‚Äù but has more room to grow, especially since Ives values Apple‚Äôs services business at $1.5 trillion.  Investors also turned to Apple as a safe haven during recent market uncertainty, thanks to its strong balance sheet and prodigious cash flow, which it uses to invest in new products, stock buybacks and to return capital to shareholders through dividends.  Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to hit a $1 trillion market cap during intraday trading on Aug. 2, 2018. It hit a $2 trillion valuation just over two years later on Aug. 19, 2020.  Apple‚Äôs peers aren‚Äôt far behind. Microsoft is worth about $2.5 trillion, Amazon has about a $1.75 market cap and Google‚Äôs market valuation is just shy of $2 trillion.  Apple stock rose 34% in 2021.";"137";"2023-06-14T11:30:13"

Using the graphic I've examined, I've observed some interesting revenue shifts. Most notably, there's an 8% decrease in iPad revenue, a significant drop considering Apple's usual stability in the tablet market. Additionally, when breaking down revenue by region, Japan ‚Äì traditionally a strong market for Apple ‚Äì has experienced a 9% drop in revenue.  Several factors might contribute to these shifts ‚Äì product lifecycle, competition, market saturation, local economic conditions, or even changes in consumer preferences.

"Could someone explain this sentence (how market maker may money)?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1bg8s30/could_someone_explain_this_sentence_how_market/";"How Do Market Makers Earn a Profit?   Market makers earn a profit through the spread between the securities bid and offer price. Because market makers bear the risk of covering a given security, which may drop in price, they are compensated for this risk of holding the assets. For example, consider an investor who sees that Apple stock has a bid price of $50 and an ask price of $50.10. What this means is that the market maker bought the Apple shares for $50 and is selling them for $50.10, earning a profit of $0.10.     [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp)     **Question**: How could market maker buy Apple share for $50? Nobody wants to sells at $50 (Ask price is $50.10).     My understanding is: the person wants to sell Apple at $50.10 (Ask price), and the person want to buy Apple share at $50 (Bid price), in order to make the deal, market marker has to spend $50.10 to buy Apple from seller then sell it $50 to buyer, therefore, market market loses $0.10, of course it does not make sense. I always thought, if there is ""gap"" between Bid price and Ask price, then there will be no deal, until someone changes mind to change Bid price or Ask price, e.g. seller is willing to lower Ask price from $50.10 to $50, or buyer is willing to increase Bid price from $50 to $50.10, then order can be executed.

"Probably a good reminder at all time highs .....";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/18syo4v/probably_a_good_reminder_at_all_time_highs/";"**Warren Buffett is piling up cash because he sees a storm brewing and can't find bargains, wealth manager says**  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-piling-cash-because-213726575.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-piling-cash-because-213726575.html)  &#x200B:  Warren Buffett's stack of cash is bigger than ever because he spies problems on the horizon and he's struggling to find bargains, one wealth manager says.  Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway held a record $157 billion in liquid assets like dollars and Treasury bills on September 30. The astonishing sum made up 15% of its $1 trillion of assets at the time, and it's equivalent to 20% of the company's $783 billion market capitalization as of Thursday's close.  ""I think he sees trouble next year,"" Lee Munson, the president and chief investor of Portfolio Wealth Advisors, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday about the significance of Buffett's cash pile. ""It means be cautious. He doesn't see any screaming deals.""  Buffett struck a dour tone on the US economy in May, warning of a ""different climate"" versus the rock-bottom interest rates and freewheeling government spending during the pandemic. He predicted that most of Berkshire's subsidiaries would report profit declines this year.  As a value investor, Buffett specializes in buying stocks and businesses at a discount to their actual worth. He's pledged to always have at least $30 billion of liquid assets at Berkshire to ensure the company never fails to meet its financial commitments. Having plenty of dry powder also enables him to pounce on cut-price assets and strike lucrative deals at tough times, as he did during the 2008 financial crisis.  Buffett made his fortune by investing in American companies like Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz, but as valuations have steadily climbed over the past decade, he's had to expand his search to find compelling deals. For example, he revealed 5% stakes in five Japanese trading houses in August 2020, and has grown those positions to nearly 9% since then.  ""Honestly, it's just hard to find good companies at a reasonable valuation,"" Munson said about Buffett's challenge today. ""The fact that he's going to Japan to find things with a PE that's reasonable, I think tells us a lot about this market.""  Buffett and his team revealed this week that they pared their huge Chevron stake and exited a bunch of long-held positions last quarter. Yet they didn't touch their two largest holdings, Apple and Bank of America.  Munson said that Berkshire is essentially pursuing a barbell strategy of owning both growth and value stocks. The conglomerate's Apple stake is similar to holding the S&P 500, given the Big Tech stock's outsized influence on the benchmark index, while the Bank of America bet is a cheap, large-cap value play, Munson said.  ""I think those are the two winners of those two indexes,"" Munson said.";"164";"2023-12-28T17:59:42"

As a result, the current optimal solution would be to contribute into the Roth IRA up to the limit and invest the remaining $193,000 in the cash account and continuing the annual contribution into the Roth IRA in following years.  &#x200B:  Margin account of $7,000 + $7,000 (margin) = $14,000. $14,000 + 30% = $18,200. Gain of $4,200 - 15% (tax) = Gain of $3,570 - my cost of margin for 1 year which is (.13 \* 7000) = Gain of $3,570 - $910 (margin) = Gain of $2,660.  &#x200B:  I can see that in this example, with the same $7,000, AFTER taxes AND cost of margin, the margin account is the better choice as opposed to both the cash account and the Roth IRA. Similar to the cash account, I have no annual contribution limit, can withdraw at any time, and can invest the full $200,000. With margin, this amount becomes $400,000. As a result, the current optimal solution appears to be investing the full amount of $200,000 + $200,000 in the margin account and disregarding the Roth IRA entirely.  &#x200B:  While I take much greater risks investing that amount in a margin account and having the knowledge/information that the average of Apple's yearly losses is \~-30%, over the long term, it's clear on paper that the optimal strategy is to go full margin, with the honest hope that the first 2-3 years are positive. I also expect my current effective margin rate of 13.00% to decrease as rates go down. I also expect my income to increase at a reasonable pace. I'm not sure if it's worth mentioning or not but I would like to marry and have children in the future.  &#x200B:  Again, is my math (and logic) correct? Am I completely overlooking something?  &#x200B:  Thanks!!  &#x200B:  &#x200B:";"0";"2023-12-22T18:58:38"

For the most part I am seeing that I should probably just sell 3M and Tesla but might want to hold on to Boeing as they have some potential large orders in negotiations. Tesla looks like it is going to stick until late 2025.  When it comes to the guidance from the investment companies, do you go off what they say with their research tools? If not, how do you determine when to give up on your stinkers? Better to take a loss and hope to make it up with a stronger stock?

For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. * Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting.  It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation.  I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors:  1. **Expense Ratio**: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. 2. **Stock Selection Methodology**: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. 3. **Performance Trends**: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. 4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. 5. **Market Positioning**: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. 6. **Innovative Approach of SoFi**: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.  It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.  **What are your thoughts?**";"0";"2024-01-24T22:46:21"

However, with this exciting opportunity comes the challenge of deciding where to allocate my funds and which investment strategy to pursue. Currently, l've evenly split my investments between an investment account and a high-yield savings account, both of which have grown to close to $20k. However, I can't help but feel that I might be missing out on potential returns by keeping too much in the high yield savings account and lacking a clear investment strategy for stocks. When I first started investing at 18, I focused on stocks that seemed promising and affordable. However, i've come to realize that this may not be the most effective strategy. Now that I'm taking investing Investing more seriously, I'm eager to explore new strategies. Recently, l've been experimenting with purchasing VOO, but aside from that, I'm feeling a bit lost on where to go next.

The increase in both was around 33%, so basically the net asset value is flat, as this 33% increase has the same purchasing power. But when I compared some of the top companies in the Indice APPL, MSFT, GOOG, TSLA and AMZN I've noticed that all of them made way more than 33%. Does this indicate it's way better for a safe haven investing **during inflationary times** to just focus on the top 5-10 instead of the ""whole"" market (the 500 companies).  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/bn79ul88gelb1.png?width=2340&format=png&auto=webp&s=38ddd3c12d9f26e644bb0e6b8e6d3fbe30a8f54b  I also did the math for the lowest 5 companies currently, as I don't know which they were during 2020 January. Only 1 company beat the 33% inflation and 4 were actually on a major LOSS.  &#x200B:  https://preview.redd.it/qb10mz7nfelb1.png?width=2333&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0e4955113542fd4a7ee483ff3da15815be016cc  Considering that S&P500 is influenced more by the top than the bottom companies we can logically assume that the majority of the top companies performed poorly, as they are anywhere close to the absurd returns of the top 5-10.  Has someone done the math for other inflationary times? Is the expectation that those top companies will underperform in the coming years when inflation decreases and the smaller companies will catch up in terms of growth?";"19";"2023-08-31T09:41:18"

It provides investors with diversified exposure to stocks of companies that are expected to have higher-than-average growth rates. * AAPL - Apple  * TD - Always good to have at least one bank for diversification * AMZN - Amazon  I know VOO and VUG overlap, especially with AAPL and AMZN, but I want him to have 2 primary ETFs and 3 to 4 stocks.

"[OC] The case for Peloton (PTON) 3 points to consider:";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1avwr3x/oc_the_case_for_peloton_pton_3_points_to_consider/";"&#x200B:  There is no doubt that Peloton stock has had a roller coaster ride since 2020.  When Peloton IPO'd in 2019, it was priced around $25-$30 a share.  When COVID hit in 2020 (and the lockdowns began), Peloton was positioned perfectly to capitalize on the millions of customers who could longer go and workout at gyms or even their workplaces. This drove Peloton's sales and subscriber growth exponentially and is what helped it's stock skyrocket going from $25 to $151 (+600% gain) by December 1, 2020. Peloton was the darling of Wallstreet. Then, the lockdowns lifted, and with it, Peloton saw its vast army of customers begin to return to their normal lives, and gyms. The growth estimates were proven to be wildly optimistic, and Peloton itself failed to scale/manage it's growth properly resulting in its stock to fall almost over 95% in the last few years resulting in today's share price of $4.33.  This huge fall in price in such a short time, is something that can easily skew investors opinion of the stock especially if that investor bought in to Peloton when it was at its high of $150- there were many people who fell victim to the  ""sunk cost fallacy"" trap. Which states: ""It is irrational to use irrecoverable costs to justify a present decision. If we acted rationally, only future costs and benefits would be taken into account.""  In other words, investors holding PTON while it fell and fell. The ""sunk cost fallacy"" way of thinking can make it extremely difficult to be objective on any investment.  Or, put another way, Peloton's meteoric rise and fall could be seen as a Value trap.  **Points to consider:**  It is unrealistic to think Peloton can return to its pandemic era stock valuation of $151 in the near term, however It is also equally unrealistic to treat Peloton as if its business (not just the stock) has lost 95% of its value in the last few years. All of the below points have caveats, I understand the risks Peloton still has to manage to truly be considered as ""turning the corner"", however, I believe that Peloton is oversold with much of the well documented bad news already priced in. So below are some positive  things I found in my DD about Peloton.  1. **Peloton Price advantage**:  I own a Peloton tread, and what I found surprising was Pelotons price point to buy a Peloton treadmill was **$3,000**. (I remembered peloton in 2019 being in the news for being the ""treadmill for the rich"" as it cost close to $20,000).  I first noticed this price difference when purchasing treadmills for a new gym a couple months ago. For comparison, a Precore TRM 835 Treadmill costs $10,795.00 (the TRM 835 has none of the user experience/interface/connectivity that peloton has). In addition, Peloton's monthly membership, priced currently at $12.99 a month which is cheaper than a gym membership. Its subscription services is robust and is always adding new features.  It gives you access to Peloton's vast library of top of the line instructor classes and so much other content  (i.e.I found the new ""video game"" feature on the treadmill i found to be engaging and fun). 2. **Peloton is an industry disruptor.** It has taken a bland, and relatively unchanged market of at home fitness equipment to a whole different level. Peloton's brand power, and unique positioning as the ""household"" name for at home fitness should not be underestimated. Where they differ from other fitness equipment makers is in their user experience and the quality of their machines with large Tesla like touchscreens, their community of trainers/users, and their ability to constantly upgrade the tread software over the cloud. Being a disruptor in any industry justifies a higher p/e (or in Pelaton's case) patience for the company to become profitable, Peloton is 3. **""Great product not a great stock""** \- analyst on CNBC.  I think this is a common belief among wallstreet. , I see this sentiment as illogical and indicative of a buying opportunity. The idea that a stock is somehow ""separate"" from the product its company produces is exactly where the opportunity is to invest resides. What the analyst was possibly alluding to was looking at Peloton quantitatively (by its numbers, growth estimates, revenues etc...) peloton may not look like a great stock- But looking at it qualitatively, Peloton looks ""great""., I see this sentiment as a possible opportunity, Bad products lead to bad stocks. Conversely,  good products (generally speaking) lead to good stocks. A good product/business will eventually be reflected in the stock if the company can keep producing this product, and if significant ""moats"" exist to protect its market share. Currently, I do not know of any other at-home fitness company can be compared apples to apples to Peloton. Peloton has a huge head start and significant 'moat' around its business.  I would love to hear anyone else's opinions on Peloton being undervalued/overvalued.  Thanks!";"6";"2024-02-21T00:41:59"
"My top ideas for next couple weeks";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1bzv07m/my_top_ideas_for_next_couple_weeks/";"Best long term buying opportunity (not recommend calls but trickling in slowly as still expecting downside risk)  United Healthcare - expect more downside but its stock prices have been going down while earnings have gone up.  Good combination for accumulation  Alibaba - harder to recommend after the recent bounce which is why it was moved from my best call idea, which is more of a short term call list, to a long term hold list  Dow jones - it broke the 50 day moving average so more downside expected but it‚Äôs closest to fair value compared to Nasdaq and s and p  McDonald - I would have it on my call list if it wasn‚Äôt for the risk of not knowing how much of the California new wage for fast food worker is built into sentiment.  But good long term hold because finally valuations are getting better, dividend is decent, and people are selling the stock forgetting/ignoring that California is such a small portion of its global market   Best call ideas Apple -oversold and ready for short term bounce but not a recommended medium term hold.  Also good stock to trickle in slowly and be ready for lot more volatility   AMD - terrible valuation and company but oversold going into earning calls.  People love to buy up semiconductor stocks last couple weeks before the call.  Good hedge if you want to short the tech or s and p index.     Best short ideas Gold - purely technical.  Way overbought   Amazon - single most overvalued tech stock in the magnificent seven and that‚Äôs really saying something.  Biggest risk to the short thesis is the earning call and people not wanting to sell leading into it and instead dumping after, which is why I only have a small position in Amazon in case it does sell of early but saving a big cash pile for major puts if it spikes after earning  Microsoft - completely overhyped.  Nothing more to say.  Energy stocks (XLE) - I took some profits on my puts I bought on Friday but look for opportunity to enter shorts after small bounce.  The most overbought sector in the entire s&P and oil price is unsustainable    Overall statement on the conditions of the market  Be very vigilant as we had into earnings call.  While the market as a whole is still ridiculously overvalued, if earning calls are good enough stock market will ignore/forget the fact that they already ran up expecting the good news.  I anticipate very bumpy 3 weeks.  I see S and P within 1% of all time high and Nasdaq within 1.5% of all time high as excellent short entries and around 5050 on s and p and 435 on the QQQ as strategic places to place bets for short term rebound.  My recommendation is to keep playing those 2 ranges until one either breaks or until after earnings call in which case it‚Äôs safe to short the market to hearts content  ";"15";"2024-04-09T17:28:52"

"What could actually destabilize the stock market right now?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1aoqfgz/what_could_actually_destabilize_the_stock_market/";"I'll start. I want to read others opinions and ideas.      The general consensus right now is we're going through great weather in the stock market, smooth sailing. Maybe even a lot of confidence to be surfing the big waves. There are some things I see on the horizon.     1. The AI transition, although has the potential to do great things, is not being adopted so fast and in the pertient areas for actual economic growth. Because of this, AI as a tool for economic growth will plateu for a couple of years. Even though it's great, it has serious limitations right now and can't help whomever do something beyond their own capabilities to a degree that makes them as competent as an expert human being. Coding wise I can tell that much is certain. So I anticipate a disilusion coming from the AI expectations that are out there soon to bring the market down. Specially Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, etc. 2. There is a serious disconnect between low income and high income people. Low income being the vast majority. This is causing insecurity to rise and creep into areas where that wasn't a problem before. As a consequence... low income people will save instead of spend, and high income people will keep spending, creating an unrealistic measurement of how the economy is doing. This will keep inflation and the prices of goods from coming down, preventing economic growth to come from both low, medium and high income populations. Making the FED reconsider lowering rates as inflation numbers are updated. 3. Slowly but surely companies will let go of staff and the unemployment number will go up. Adding weight to the idea that raising rates is a no go for now. High unemployment levels can lead to decreased consumer spending, further slowing economic growth and complicating efforts to combat inflation. 4. Group monopolization: Tech companies and a relatively small group of companies are taking most of the pie. This imbalance will have an effect on the quality of goods being produced. Only a handful of options will be left to choose from and the will of entreprenours will be eroded from not being able to compete with companies who can keep financing the production of their products regardless of their bad quality. So a general lack of doing business motivation will permeate the air and consumers could attempt to simply stop purchasing and going the DIY route. 5. Europe in general seems to be in a hole. Swiss banks will have some turbulence in the near, medium term future: the debt of countries like Greece, Italy, Spain, etc will just start adding up and making the Euro currency to continue to lose value against other currencies. 6. Geopolitical tensions could escalate in different fronts and cause bottlenecks in production, transportation, travel, etc. You have the US-China relationship disputing technology and intellectual property rights and creating a competition with other countries for where goods are produced to be imported to the US. Escalation in tensions could bring about tariffs, sanctions, or retaliatory measures. There's also the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel-Gaza situation, Iran and Western countries over nuclear programs, other oil producing nations and the oil pricing situation. 7. US elections coming soon.     Considering this and the list below of what has triggered the US stock market to go down at least 20%, what do you see creeping up, potentially, as a catalyst for the market to flip to bear territory?     1. **1973-1974 Stock Market Crash**: Triggered by the oil crisis following the Yom Kippur War, when OAPEC (Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries) proclaimed an oil embargo. This, coupled with high inflation, stagnating economic growth (stagflation), and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, led to a severe bear market. 2. **Early 1980s Recession**: High inflation rates, exacerbated by oil price shocks and aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker to combat inflation, led to a severe recession and a significant market downturn in the early 1980s. 3. **Black Monday, 1987**: On October 19, 1987, stock markets around the world crashed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropping by 22% in a single day. Factors included trade deficits, rising interest rates, and overvaluation, but the crash was exacerbated by the widespread use of portfolio insurance and automated trading systems. 4. **Dot-com Bubble Burst, 2000-2002**: After years of speculative investment in internet-based companies, the bubble burst in 2000, leading to a significant market correction. Many tech companies saw their stock values plummet, leading to a broader market downturn and a mild recession. 5. **Global Financial Crisis, 2007-2009**: Triggered by the collapse of the housing bubble in the United States, leading to a crisis in subprime mortgages and a severe liquidity crunch. This crisis quickly spread globally, leading to significant declines in stock markets worldwide, bank failures, and a deep global recession. 6. **COVID-19 Pandemic, 2020**: The global outbreak of COVID-19 led to unprecedented economic disruption, as governments around the world imposed lockdowns and travel restrictions to combat the pandemic.

"Investment plan for about 85 000$ USD over the coming year";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1521zl5/investment_plan_for_about_85_000_usd_over_the/";"So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years.  I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030.  However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now.  I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices.  The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (**European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ** \- I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of **Norwegian dividend stocks** (Done)-Buy shares in **AMD** for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in **Alphabet** ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin **Tesla Corp** TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in **TSMC** TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to **bank account** I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time)  Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco **S&P 500 UCITS ETF** Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE **China UCITS ETF** FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE **India UCITS ETF** FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering **Apple** APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering **Microsoft** MSF, **Meta** FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering **Amazon** (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-**Berkshire Hathaway Class B** BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering **Palantir** PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered **Nvidia** (FOMO)-Considered **IBM** and **Intel** as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)  So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?  Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)";"1";"2023-07-17T15:28:09"

"Futures muted, key inflation data on tap";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/13bk9bt/futures_muted_key_inflation_data_on_tap/";"   U.S. stock index futures were muted on Monday at the beginning of a week packed with economic data points, including a key inflation reading that will be scrutinized for signs of whether the Federal Reserve is succeeding in its attempt to cool prices.  At 5:06 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 33 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 1 points, or 0.02%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 15.5 points, or 0.12%.     U.S. stock indexes staged a late-week rally on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting its biggest one-day percentage gain since Jan. 6 after upbeat results from Apple Inc and U.S. jobs data highlighting a resilient labor market.  Focus will be on the Labor Department's inflation data on Wednesday, which is expected to show the consumer price index (CPI) likely climbed 0.4% in April, after gaining 0.1% in March, while excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI likely increased 0.4% last month.  Data on producer prices, weekly jobless claims, and on consumer sentiment are all lined up through the week.  These data points will help investors not only gauge whether the Fed's aggressive tightening cycle - including its most recent 25 basis point hike last week - is working towards tamping down inflation but also, if fears of stagflation are founded.  ""Market expectation of cuts already in the summer are based on a too-optimistic forecast of a quick disinflation,"" Paolo Zanghieri Senior economist at Generali Investments wrote in a note. ""Anyway, inflation stabilizing at 3% would not be enough for the Fed to start easing rates.""  Regional bank shares extended gains in premarket, with PacWest Bancorp jumping 13.5% after the company announced quarterly dividend. Peers, Western Alliance Bancorp, Comerica Inc and Zions Bancorp rose between 2.8% and 4.9%.  Shares of such regional lenders rebounded on Friday from declines tied to the collapse of First Republic Bank.  American Airlines Group Inc rose 1.9% after J.P.

Fundamental stock analysis of decent size companies (no penny stocks or crazy tech companies): I have no idea in technical analysis. I am thinking if I am any good I could do some YouTube videos on some of the stocks most requested by the community here and help people make money. I will be using conservative numbers wherever I think it is possible.  Concentrix CNCX is a traditional CX call center service that has many clients like Apple etc. **Three of the most important factors for analyzing stocks is History, Competitors, and Outlook -- so I will be trying to put my take on it and make it short as possible.**  **Competitors:**  |As of 2022|Teleperformance TLPFY|TTEC Holdings TTEC|Majorel MAJ.AS|Concentrix CNCX| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |||||| |Revenue|8.2 bn|2.5 bn|2.1 bn|9.8 bn| |Gross Profit|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A| |Operating Margin|994 M (12.2%)|250 M (10%)|210 M (10%)|980 M (10%)| |Assets|4.4 bn|1.1 bn|1 bn|4 bn| |Liabilities|(5.2 bn)|(1.5 bn)|(1 bn)|(8 bn)| |Asset - Liabilities|(800 M)|(400 M)|0|(4 bn)| |Enterprise Value|10 bn (10 times)|2.5 bn (10 times)|2.1 bn (10 times)|9.8 bn| |Market Value|9.2 bn|2.1 bn|2.1 bn|5.8 bn| |Should be Market Price|158|44|22|115| |Actual Price|162|35|29|83| |Difference|N/A|\+25%|\-25%|\+40%|  **History:**  The biggest competitor to Concentrix is Teleperformance. So comparing the history of Teleperformance should tell you what the normal range of valuation should be for Concentrix.  ||2021|2020|2019|2018|2017| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Revenue|8.73 bn|8.06 bn|7.05 bn|6 bn|5.08| |Gross Profit|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A| |Operating Margin|870M (10%)|800M (10%)|700M (10%)|600M (10%)|500M (10%)| |Assets|5 bn|4.5 bn|4 bn|3.3 bn|2.7 bn| |Liabilities|(5.9 bn)|(5.7 bn)|(4.9 bn)|(4.2 bn)|(3 bn)| |Asset - Liabilities|(1 bn)|(1.2 bn)|(1 bn)|(1 bn)|(300M)| |Actual Enterprise Value|23 bn|20bn|16bn|11 bn|8.3 bn| |Actual Market Value|22bn|19bn|15bn|10 bn|8 bn| |EV/Revenue|2.75|2.5|2.25|2|1.6| |Average|2.22|2.22|2.22|2.22|2.22|  **Outlook:**  Concentrix is acquiring Webhelp (private) and becoming the biggest CX provider. They are neck in neck with Teleperformance who acquired Majorel for 1.5 times sales to Enterprise Value - means they all feel prices are low enough for consolidation in the industry.  Looking at the first table it looks like Concentrix is undervalued by 40% on already depressed numbers of EV/Revenue as average EV/Revenue for Teleperformance has been more like 2 historically. So prices will be expected to reach $120 on just 1 times EV/Revenue.  But lets say if we give it a more reasonable number of 1.5-2 EV/Revenue then stock price will be expected to reach $160.  Let me know if this looks good and any comments/upvotes will be appreciated.

"SP500 Futures TA for 8/2/23";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/15fne0p/sp500_futures_ta_for_8223/";" *I share my plan for educational purposes and discussion and it is not intended as trade recommendations or ideas.*  ***Recap***: In the plan for today I wrote that *‚Äúa sustained breakout above* ***4609-20*** *would signal that a new trend leg is developing‚Äù*. This level was tested but not taken out overnight and so what looked like a potential breakout at yesterday‚Äôs close again failed and kept the market in a tight range.¬†  In said in the plan that I 'm viewing **4596** support. In the premarket session, the market tested below this level and recovered it, and I got long just after the market opened today. I exited the majority of the trade at **4609**, the next resistance level from the plan, and the last contract was taken out at breakeven. For as tight a range as the market is in, I‚Äôm happy to get a win at all. The market proceeded to retest **4596** and even towards the other support level from yesterday‚Äôs educational section, but really didn‚Äôt go anywhere.  ***Balance/Trend***: The market has been in the balance area since July 18: I have defined this region as **4559-4609**, and added an additional level at **4620** to capture the drift we‚Äôve seen at the highs when the market has tried breaking above 4609. Since Friday, this has tightened further and there is no predominant recent trend. Core trends, ones that span weeks or months or more, are all still pointing up.¬†  ***Analysis***: Today‚Äôs action was more of what we‚Äôve come to expect in balanced markets and indeed is the reason why I always track the balance and trend in the section above. In yesterday‚Äôs newsletter, I highlighted the fact that the market continues to balance within the upper distribution of the Friday profile and today‚Äôs low keeps that bit of analysis relevant.  In the near term, I would watch for bulls to hold the market above **4589** (and **4582** at the lowest) to keep their near-term momentum . A failure here raises the odds that the market moves back to the balance area lows at **4559**. Whatever happens though, it‚Äôs clearly a choppy consolidation until some sort of trend resumes (above **4609-20** or below **4559**). With jobs figures due the rest of this week and Apple and Amazon reporting on Thursday, volatility could/should be just ahead.¬†  ***Plan***  * There are several support levels that I‚Äôm watching that are bunched together, as they often are in these environments: **4573**, **4579-82, 4589, 4596**. These were all covered in greater detail elsewhere, but given their proximity and the choppy conditions, trading these could be very difficult. As usual, I am following my guidelines to get confirmation and exit the trade at the next level * One potential support that I‚Äôm watching is at **4562**, a spot where the market previously saw strong buying. Ideally the market would test **4559** first and bounce from there for me to get long at this level * If the market were to lose the balance area lows, I would be hesitant to trade counter to that trend, though a spot to watch for a support trade would be at **4542-45** * Other potential support levels are **4529**, **4494-97**, **4479, 4472**, **4466** * Again, the market would really need to clear **4620** to convince me of a breakout, and even then I rarely chase them. My preference would be a breakout and retest, perhaps down to about **4616**,¬† to signal a long * There is potential resistance at **4636**, where I added a second aqua trendline to better reflect recent market action. The core level from that channel is at \~**4662** * The next spot for resistance is **4683** and comes from the yellow trend channel, which I recently added to connect the October ‚Äò22 and March ‚Äò23 lows  https://preview.redd.it/o7ver5pi3kfb1.png?width=1714&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffe4133de72f78b6181ecb263e788b9e8feb3131";"2";"2023-08-01T22:12:42"

In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions.  &#x200B:  It‚Äôs an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inflation battle, noted FactSet‚Äôs Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post.  &#x200B:  The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%.  &#x200B:  The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday‚Äôs close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%.  &#x200B:  Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%.  &#x200B:  Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said.  &#x200B:  That didn‚Äôt mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote.  &#x200B:  Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found.  &#x200B:  Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July.  &#x200B:  The strategy ‚Äúindicates the Fed‚Äôs measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,‚Äù Jakobsen said.  &#x200B:  The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks‚Äô bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group‚Äôs announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering.  &#x200B:  SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a ‚Äúmini‚Äù banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown.  &#x200B:  Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks ‚Äî Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78%  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%,  [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. AMZN, 0.16%,  Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%,  Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%,  Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%,  and Meta Platforms Inc.  META, 0.56%.  &#x200B:  See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024?  &#x200B:  Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind.  &#x200B:  The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.  &#x200B:  In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high:  &#x200B:  The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500‚Äôs weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted.  &#x200B:  Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500‚Äôs overall return, he wrote, with the company‚Äôs success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.";"9";"2023-12-27T16:52:27"

The rebound came as the market was also bolstered by data on hiring that was deemed strong enough to soften concerns about a recession without prompting the Federal Reserve to tighten the screws on the economy further.  PacWest soared over 80 percent, after falling over 50 percent on Thursday. Western Alliance‚Äôs share price rose almost 50 percent, also recouping a chunk of its drop the day before.  The relief rally helped to lift the broader market, with the S&P 500 up 1.9 percent, its first day of gains in May.   Still, the gains weren‚Äôt enough to reverse another bruising week for the nation‚Äôs midsize banks. The seizure and sale of First Republic to JPMorgan Chase on Monday was presented by Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan‚Äôs chief executive, ushering in the end of the crisis that began in March with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.   However, Mr. Dimon added that there ‚Äúmay be another smaller‚Äù bank to run into trouble. Shortly thereafter, a fresh bout of pressure clobbered the stocks of smaller lenders like PacWest and Western Alliance, which tried to reassure investors that their deposit bases were stable and that the market moves were unrelated to their financial health.  Even with Friday‚Äôs bounce, PacWest remained set to end the week having lost nearly half its market value. Western Alliance ended roughly a quarter below where it started the week. The S&P 500 ended the week 0.8 percent lower.  After trading ended on Friday, the Federal Reserve released data showing that deposits at commercial banks in the United States declined slightly in the week that ended April 26, falling to $17.17 trillion from $17.18 trillion in the week before. At domestically chartered banks, though, they ticked higher ‚Äî to $15.96 trillion from $15.94 trillion previously. In either case, the data showed deposits had stabilized following much more sizable declines in March and early April.  Concern over the fate of the regional lenders was further relieved by fresh data on Friday that showed a robust labor market, with the pace of new hiring in April coming in stronger than expected and workers still achieving elevated wage gains.  Despite the strong numbers for April, downward revisions to data from earlier months show the longer-term trend of a slowing labor market persisted, and investors still expect Fed policymakers to pause on raising interest rates when they next meet in June.  Elsewhere, oil prices rose, often a reflection of a brighter outlook for the global economy. They, too, bounced higher following a sharp decline earlier in the week.  A further tailwind for the market came from Apple, which reported better-than-expected profits for the first quarter, helping push its share price nearly 5 percent higher on Friday. Because of the size of the tech behemoth, its moves have more of an effect on the S&P 500 than any company in the index.  Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, has said that it is possible to slow the economy enough to stem inflation without tipping it into recession. Arguably, Friday‚Äôs employment data supports that notion of a so-called soft landing.   Nonetheless, some investors remain on edge, even after Friday‚Äôs bounce. The strong data nudged higher the possibility of a rate increase in June.  The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changing interest-rate expectations, also rose, climbing 0.16 percentage points to 3.9 percent ‚Äî a big move for an asset that typically changes by hundredths of a percentage point each day, and a sign that investors think interest rates could stay higher for longer.";"0";"2023-05-06T08:52:58"

"The Bad Economics Of The Audio Streaming Industry (Spotify Example)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/17m3215/the_bad_economics_of_the_audio_streaming_industry/";"Hey everyone, before I share with you my thoughts on Spotify, I thought it might be a good idea to share a famous quote from Warren Buffett, which I think applies to the audio streaming market: *'When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact'.*  This posts breaks down:  * Overview of Spotify * Economics of the Audio Streaming Business * Why I think its bad economics for investors  # Spotify Overview:   Spotify is one of the world‚Äôs most popular audio streaming subscription service giving access to over 100 million tracks and 5 million podcasts to millions of members. Spotify is the leader in the audio streaming market with a market share of 30.5% and Spotify has been growing their premium subscribers every year with no signs of slowing down.  *Premium Subscribers (In Millions)*  |**2015**|**2016**|**2017**|**2018**|**2019**|**2020**|**2021**|**2022**|**2023 (2Qs)**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |92|154|244|341|445|567|675|770|*430\**|  In 2022, the global audio streaming market was around $34 billion. The audio streaming market is expected to grow to over $100 billion by 2030 according to research and markets. Despite Spotify's growth and the growth of the industry at large, the economics of Spotify and other businesses in this market doesn't appear to be looking good at all and in my opinion I don't see signs of improvement. I will explain the economics of the industry a little below but I will first present revenue and profitability in years 2015 & 2022:  *Revenue (In Millions)*  |**2015**|**2022**| |:-|:-| |$1,940|$11,727|  *Profitability (In Millions)*  |**2015**|**2022**| |:-|:-| |($235)|($689)|  Although I only present these two years, operating losses for this company has been consistent in all years between this period. Someone has to cover the cost of the money losing operations of Spotify and it looks as if shareholders has been footing the bill. Shares outstanding has been increasing.  Shares outstanding:  |**2015**|**2022**| |:-|:-| |141,946,000|195,846,362|  I believe Spotify can continue to grow revenue but I think the path to profitability is no where near in sight. Looking more closely into the economics of the audio streaming business, it appears that Spotify **doesn't have a moat** and I don't think any competitor can gain an advantage in this industry.  # Economics of the Audio Streaming Business   There are certain rules in this industry that prevent any company from gaining any real advantage from another. The audio streaming business is subject to a ‚Äòmost favored nation clause‚Äô, which sounds complicated but it essentially means that audio streaming providers such as Spotify is in some ways restricted from negotiating exclusive deals with artists. Let‚Äôs say Spotify has agreed to a deal with a music publisher at $10,000, and this deal contains a most favoured nation clause, if another publisher comes in and agrees to a $15,000 deal with Spotify, then Spotify will have to pay the same amount to first publisher. For example, let‚Äôs say Spotify signed an agreement that gives it permission to stream **The Weeknd** ***(which is the most listened artist on Spotify)*** on its platform. And this agreement contains a MFN clause. The way this works is that Spotify will need to pay royalties to the Universal Music Group, which is the Weeknd‚Äôs publisher, every time a song is played on its platform. The Royalty rates are set by the Copyright Royalty Board which establishes the minimum rate a streaming service has to pay their artists. If Spotify signs a new agreement with **Rihanna,** and Spotify pays Rihanna's publisher (Sony/ATV) a higher amount to stream her songs on the platform, then Spotify will have to pay the difference to the Weekend Publisher because of the clause agreement. This applies to other audio streaming services such as Apple Music, Youtube Music, etc.  # Why this is bad economics for Spotify investors    **Reason 1:** Since it is in the best interests of music artists to go after those MFN agreements: this really prevents any audio streaming service from signing exclusive deals with music artists that prevent from being streamed on other platforms. It is also the goal of a music artist to promote their music as far and as wide as possible and be to paid the maximum amount, and to do that, any major artist, or any artist in general will also have similar agreements with other streaming platforms, giving none of these platforms any competitive advantage. ***This is very different from video streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, who has their own production studio and exclusive rights to TV shows and movies.***  **Reason 2:** As someone who likes listening to music, it really doesn‚Äôt bother me what platform I use, as long I can listen to the music I like. So I really struggle to find any competitive advantage Spotify has and because of that, I‚Äôm not really sure if Spotify can maintain its position in the market without spending an excessive amount. And from what we have already seen, Spotify is already struggling to keep its costs down so achieving a sustainable level of profits in the future is very hard to predict.  **Reason 3:** Competition. Since the audio streaming market is huge and is expected to grow, this will attract new competitors into the market. Without a competitive advantage (other than a well-known brand - not very durable) Spotify will likely need to increase their costs further in the future to maintain and protect its market share of 30.5%. If more competitors enter the market, then Spotify will need to increase marketing costs to attract new consumers, this expense may increase by a lot. Since Spotify is a technology company, research and development costs will need to continually increase, since old and new competitors will be investing to improve their audio streaming service so they take market share from Spotify. Another problem is pricing. Let‚Äôs imagine a new competitor enters the market and sells their streaming service at a lower price than Spotify. Spotify will then need to reduce its subscription costs to prevent their members from cancelling their membership and signing up with a competitor.  Those are my thoughts on Spotify and the economics of the audio streaming business. As a consumer and a lover of music, we gain the benefit of competition. However, I think the consumer benefit will continue to come at the expense of shareholders. Of course, I could be wrong. Please share your thoughts on Spotify and whether you agree or disagree with my review, I welcome any discussion :)  Hope everyone is enjoying their day.";"27";"2023-11-02T14:05:22"

To make the game look real, the developer needs to build a visual world with similar physics and light effects to the real world through coding, and those models coded almost needed by every game, it named as game engine, a set of universal software to create digital content simulate physic and light effects in real world and add functions in them. Unity is a company to provides this kind of software that can support game developers to create 2D or 3D content, like characters, buildings, or nature objectives, and provide run and monetize services meanwhile.      [ Unity business ](https://preview.redd.it/gf7z7f0elzcc1.png?width=1126&format=png&auto=webp&s=5812c326c654d53b2e17136fd759fcf458ad72ab)     **Business**   Unity has two segments with high correlation. The first is Create Solutions, which is its popular game engine combined with a set of software tools for Real-Time 2D&3D content creation in multiple platforms, most of which are acquired by Unity. Unity's engine becoming popular with mobile devices and games explosion. We can see most games made with Unity are mobile living games, like Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, COD Mobile, and Honor of Kings. Those games earned money mainly through purchases inner App or subscriptions, not a one-off fee like 3A video games. This defined a high correlation with Unity's Grow Solutions. After many acquisitions, Unity added many useful tools to its software platform, like DevOps, which can let developers process scales idea model tests, and Pixyz, which can proceed with CAD files, helping Unity expand its product use in other industries. I think this is important for Unity to achieve its long-term 30% annual growth goal.    The second business is Grow Solutions, this is a service package open for every developer, even if you didn't make content with Unity. Unity provides a lot of marketing tools that help developer test their apps and access users, and the ad auction platform can help them sell the ad space in their game to advertisers. This business created a special advantage of working capital management as Unity can use the money from advertisers to run its business through the management of turnover of AR and AP. In recent years, Unity has kept developing its living game services for studios, like team coordination, user management, and game hosting. Those businesses are included in Grow Solutions.   Unity is promoting a cross-selling model between two segments and strengthening their integration, I believe that Unity will keep two units but development as a whole.   Unity got money from seat-based subscription fees in Create Solutions and from revenue or profit-shared commission in Grow Solutions. The key metrics for Unity's success are user retention, user expenditure expansion, and new user growth. I think the future for Unity is bright because   1) its engine product has many users and dominates mobile game development, which is the    highest growth sector in the video game industry and for the first time is the largest sector in 2023. This will give a growth foundation for Unity:   2) its product portfolio has no competitive switch options. Unity's engine product is simply to be used for universal indies and different-size studios and support AR/VR content creation. Compared to other engine providers, Unity has built a strong ad and monetized platform for apps after acquiring ironSource.   3) Unity has strong big clients and supporters internationally, like Apple, Tencent, Mihoyo, and Sequoia Capital, which give stable business and funding to Unity.   4) after the storm caused by the revision of the fee model, Unity lost its leader, John, and the current temporary CEO and board are processing a review of Unity's product portfolio and cutting expenses, which may promote Unity to achieve breakeven in operating profit. I think Unity will focus on game and industry sectors and enhance its advancement in AR creation, AI integration, living game services, and ad platforms.  &#x200B:  [ Revenue and profit growth ](https://preview.redd.it/kqnjew3hlzcc1.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&s=137f1b64d2c9f4f1b5476e2d51b24416b45fd739)     **Growth**   Unity's revenue growth declined in the recent two years, breaking up its management's 30% annual growth guidance. The reason for the decline is the low growth of Create Solutions. Unity attributes this decline to the slowdown of the whole gaming market compared with the Covid period and especially Chinese mobile game market growth stagnated. I think this is dangerous for Unity because low growth means declining new uses or user spending on the platform, which is the foundation of Unity's valuation, more important than margins. The 2023 TTM revenue growth of 46% is driven by the ironSource acquisition and the increase in Grow Solutions. The operating margin is becoming better as the Unity team finally realized that some of their investment in R&D and technical acquisition didn't generate high ROI. The capital market always tells stores, that if high growth does not persist, they must accelerate their speed to earn a positive margin, especially in the high rising cost period. This is what Unity's management does.   I think the potential Fed's cutting will benefit Unity's valuation and the mobile gaming market and new industry entered will refuel the growth of Unity in the future, so Unity can be an opportunity if it can achieve the client base synergy in the ironSource acquisition and improve growth in Create Solutions.  &#x200B:  [ Operation metrics ](https://preview.redd.it/jj7h5ubklzcc1.png?width=1425&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecd98d0a3846640e4a9d397b1f906d38e0a8bd78)     **Operating**   Unity provides two useful metrics to access their business operations. The first is Customers Contributing More than 100k, this number keeping high growth and a little slowdown in 2022 and 2023 if not conclude the acquisition. I think this is good because this means Unity still has a strong attraction for new users.   The second one is the Dollar-based net Expansion Rate, which is a ratio of the same users' spending in this period to the last period. This is an important ratio for SAAS company to supervise their product performance. Generally, this ratio exceeding 80% is modest, exceeding 100% is good, and exceeding 120% is great. I saw Unity's ratio crashed in 2021 and kept declining in the last two years and may be below 100% this year. This is the reason why Unity's revenue growth declined. They can't promote user spending more on their platform. One reason is the spending slowdown of the big client and the whole market, but Unity still has failures with their product and tools, like frequent updates and inaccuracies of ad targeting tools, which increase the cost of the customers.   Now Unity wants to re-focus on its high-value product portfolios, I hope the new management can keep the product at an advanced role in the gaming industry and compete in other new areas, which can help increasing in users and expansion rate.  &#x200B:  [ Margins and cash conversion cycle ](https://preview.redd.it/qrs231zmlzcc1.png?width=1823&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea9425a0facf1a4e9beb792942f47b0833ff1c62)     **Profit**   Unity has not profit, the data shows bad margins and some good cash flows. Unity's gross margin is high, similar to its peers. The gross margin declined with the acquisition of ironSource. The operating margin keeps declining as high-level spending on R&D, overheads, and acquisitions. The free cash flow is better than margins, and it's positive in the 2023 TTM. Unity has enough money to run its daily business, the secret is cash conversion. Unity will get money from subscribers and advertisers first, then provide services and ad revenue to its customers. If I added the payable ad fees owned by Unity to its payable turnover, the cash conversion cycle becomes -155 days, although improving from 2018, this can give Unity an advantage to use the customers, actually ad space suppliers' money to run its business. The other reason to improve cash flow is stock compensation, I calculate the issue price is around $110. Which is great? Maybe for management, but did not add much value for investors considering the offset of the dilution.   The good thing is I can see all margins improving recently, because of the review of the company's strategy. This is similar to PayPal, which moves from high user growth to maximum margins, but they will pay much from their market cap.   &#x200B:  [ Revenue quality and dilution problem ](https://preview.redd.it/anj4aouolzcc1.png?width=1818&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd144777476753fdeda24f66385498b3a1b7abc6)     **Quality and Cash Flow**   Again, as a company with negative margins, Unity has low-quality revenue, especially in a slowdown of growth and a high interest rate period. Unity is an expert in managing its cash flow, and most expenses are paid by stock at around $110. But there generated another problem for shareholders, the dilution. I noticed Unity has proceeded with a $2.5b share repurchase plan using money from convertible notes with low interest. This note has a call option that covers all shares that can be convertible. This method can reduce the effect of dilution by issuing many shares for acquisition and expense payment, and Unity may achieve a stable equity structure after it cuts more expenses and acquisitions.  &#x200B:  [ Investment and equity returns ](https://preview.redd.it/2yt4x5xqlzcc1.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=43621e4adce3cddffac11365a8fe888fbfa9685e)     **Return**   Unity has negative returns, but all return ratio's trend is positive. Anyway, Unity must prove its business can achieve a positive return for the investors finally.  &#x200B:  [ Asset stability ](https://preview.redd.it/7vqfoxxtlzcc1.png?width=1243&format=png&auto=webp&s=50b5050fcb752302fa2dc7db2b0faf37e83334e4)     **Asset**   Unity's AR and Long-term fixed assets are stable, but intangible assets increased much in recent years because of increased goodwill from frequent acquisitions. Many technical acquisitions are essential for Unity to keep its product in advance in competition. I think the high intangible asset increase weakens its balance sheet. Now, that Unity is in reviewing its product portfolio, Unity may write off some goodwill in the future and negative to profit.  &#x200B:  [ Capital structure and solvency ability ](https://preview.redd.it/c4bji24wlzcc1.png?width=1816&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e01c243e9ab47e4d54052b2bb298ce3968afe35)     **Capital Structure**   Unity's debt level jumped as it issued Note 2026 of $1.5b and Note 2027 of $1b. Those convertible notes with easy interest burden and a high convertible price. Unity's insolvency risk looks high with low organic free cash flows, but I don't have much concern with that because the debt has 2 years to maturity, and Unity can refinance from its big investors and it achieved positive free cash flow.  &#x200B:  [ Valuation multiples ](https://preview.redd.it/g5k34o0ylzcc1.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=10e4b9995922d8bcc5834778bb1959a8cccc88f7)     **Valuation**   I got the $14.5 share price through the DCF model. I think the DCF model is not a good one to calculate the valuation for high-growth companies with negative margins, because many assumptions will change in a short time and the result can not well explain the market price. The growth stock is most like merchandise combined with special characters, its price defined by investors' demand and appetite.   The stage judgment and comparison valuation method may be more accurate. Unity now entered into a new stage to prove its business can combine growth and profitability. This stage doesn't have high valuation multiples compared with its history.   I see Unity's PS and PB multiples decline much and below its average line, which means Unity has paid off for its slowdown in growth. I cannot confirm this is a fair valuation without compare with its competitors, but I see its price stable at $25-$40 in the last 2 years.       **Conclusion**   Unity is like a growing kid, has an amazing product used by universal users. Although Unity's old strategy is failing and is highly uncertain in profitability and balance sheet, it makes me impressed with its cash management and market shares in the game-developing market. I think it is an opportunity for some investors with high-risk tolerance to consider many catalysts in the next year, including solid growth in mobile gaming, in which Unity has high permeability, a new strategy released by new management, expense discipline, and the potential interest rate cut.   I will do a comparison next to analyze if Unity has advanced in its product and financials.";"10";"2024-01-17T12:40:17"
