"Apple announces largest-ever $110 billion share buyback as iPhone sales drop 10% ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ciq1fw/apple_announces_largestever_110_billion_share/";"Apple reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday that were slightly higher than Wall Street expectations, but showed overall revenue down 4%, and iPhone sales falling 10%.   Apple announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in the company’s history, and a 22% increase over last year’s $90 billion authorization.    Here’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates in the March quarter:   EPS: $1.53 vs. $1.50 estimated   Revenue: $90.75 billion vs. $90.01 billion estimated   iPhone revenue: $45.96 billion vs. $46.00 billion estimated   Mac revenue: $7.5 billion vs. $6.86 billion estimated   iPad revenue: $5.6 billion vs. $5.91billion estimated   Other Products revenue: $7.9 billion vs. $8.08 billion estimated   Services revenue: $23.9 billion vs. $23.27 billion estimated   Gross margin: 46.6% vs. 46.6% estimated   Apple did not provide formal guidance, but Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that overall sales would “grow low single digits” during the June quarter.    Apple posted $81.8 billion in revenue during the year-ago June quarter and LSEG analysts were looking for a forecast of $83.23 billion.    Apple reported $23.64 billion in net income, a 2% decrease from $24.16 billion in the year-earlier period. Overall sales fell 4% in the March quarter.   Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that year-over-year sales suffered from a difficult comparison to the year-ago period, when the company realized $5 billion in delayed iPhone 14 sales from Covid-based supply issues.   “If you remove that $5 billion from last year’s results, we would have grown this quarter on a year-over-year basis,” Cook said. “And so that’s how we look at it internally from how the company is performing.”   Apple said iPhone sales fell nearly 10% to $45.96 billion, suggesting weak demand for the current generation of iPhones, which were released in September. The sales were in-line with analyst estimates, and Cook said that without last year’s increased sales, iPhone revenue would have been flat.    Mac sales were up 4% to $7.45 billion, but they are still below the segment’s high-water mark set in 2022. Cook said sales were driven by the company’s new MacBook Air models that were released with an upgraded M3 chip in March.    Other Products, which is how Apple reports sales of its Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, was down 10% on an annual basis to $7.9 billion in revenue.   During the quarter, Apple released its first new major product category in years, the Vision Pro virtual reality headset, but the $3500 device is expected to sell in low quantities, especially compared to Apple’s major product lines.    “We’re only scratching the surface there so we couldn’t be more excited about our opportunity there,” Cook said.   Apple has not released a new iPad since 2022, which is a drag on sales. Revenue for the division fell 17% to $5.6 billion. Apple is expected to announce new iPads on May 7 that could revive demand for the product line.    Cook also said Apple has “big plans to announce” from an “AI point of view” during its iPad event next week as well as at the company’s annual developer conference in June.    Services was a bright spot during the quarter. Sales rose 14.2% to $23.9 billion. That’s how Apple reports revenue from its subscription services, warranties, licensing deals with search engines, and payments. Apple has a broad definition of subscribers, which includes users subscribing to apps through Apple’s App Store, and said that it has over 1 billion paid subscriptions.    Sales in Greater China, Apple’s third largest region, were off 8% to $17.8 billion in revenue, which was significantly better than the $15.25 billion in sales expected by FactSet analysts, potentially quelling investor worries that Apple may have been losing market share to local competitors such as Huawei.    “I feel good about China, I think more about long term than to the next week or so,” Cook said.   Cook told CNBC that iPhone sales grew in China during the quarter. “That may come as a surprise to some people,” Cook said.    In addition to the buyback authorization, Apple said it would pay a 25 cent dividend, a one cent increase. Apple’s $110 billion buyback authorization is the largest-ever announced, ahead of Apple’s previous repurchases, according to data from Birinyi Associates.

"DOJ sues Apple over iPhone monopoly";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bk7xgd/doj_sues_apple_over_iphone_monopoly/";"The Department of Justice sued Apple on Thursday, saying its iPhone ecosystem is a monopoly that drove its “astronomical valuation” at the expense of consumers, developers and rival phone makers.  Federal antitrust enforcement and 17 attorneys general also say that Apple’s anti-competitive practices extend beyond the iPhone and Apple Watch businesses, citing Apple’s advertising, browser, FaceTime and news offerings.  “Each step in Apple’s course of conduct built and reinforced the moat around its smartphone monopoly,” the complaint filed in the District of New Jersey said. Apple shares were down around 1.8% as investors anticipated the lawsuit.  The Justice Department said in a release that to keep consumers buying iPhones, Apple moved to block cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party wallet and smartwatch compatibility and disrupted non-App Store programs and cloud-streaming services.  The challenge represents a significant risk to Apple’s walled-garden business model. The company says that complying with regulations costs the company money, could prevent it from introducing new products or services, and could hurt customer demand.  The lawsuit could force Apple to make changes in some of its most valuable businesses: The iPhone, in which Apple reported over $200 billion in sales in 2023, the Apple Watch, part of the company’s $40 billion wearables business, and its profitable services line, which reported $85 billion in revenue.  “If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the release.  Apple said in a statement that it disagreed with the premise of the lawsuit and that it would defend against it.  “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect,” an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. “It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”  The lawsuit follows years of investigations into Apple’s business practices and two prior DOJ cases against Apple: One over e-book prices and another over allegations that it colluded with other technology companies to depress salaries.  “This anticompetitive behavior is designed to maintain Apple’s monopoly power while extracting as much revenue as possible,” the complaint said.  iMessage, Apple Watch, and cloud gaming  The complaint highlights comments from CEO Tim Cook and other executives. Some users have asked Apple to improve Android-to-iPhone messaging. Developers have gone as far as creating apps that can circumvent the platform limitations, only to be shut down by Apple.  Prosecutors highlighted one exchange between Cook and a consumer.  “Not to make it personal but I can’t send my mom certain videos,” the complaint says one user told Cook, referring to a 2022 interview at a Vox Media event.  “Buy your mom an iPhone,” Cook responded.  The DOJ is also focusing on Apple’s smartwatch, Apple Watch, saying the company designed it to only work with iPhones, and not Android devices. The company’s decision means that “users who purchase the Apple Watch face substantial out-of-pocket costs if they do not keep buying iPhones,” according to the complaint.  The DOJ said Apple has fought cloud streaming services on its App Store platform, blocking consumer access to high-quality video games on iPhones, echoing complaints from Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta.  Apple has faced several significant antitrust challenges more recently, largely focused on its control over the iPhone App Store. It mostly won in a civil suit against Epic Games in 2021, although it made concessions during the trial and had to make some changes to its policies under California law.  “Today’s lawsuit seeks to hold Apple accountable and ensure it cannot deploy the same, unlawful playbook in other vital markets,” Assistant Attorney General for antitrust Jonathan Kanter said in the release.  The company is currently jockeying with the European Commission over whether it’s complying with a new Digital Markets Act, which forces Apple to open up the iPhone app store to rivals such as Microsoft or Epic Games. Apple plans to charge big companies that eschew its app store 50 cents per download.  Apple was fined $2 billion in the EU over a dispute with Spotify about whether the music streaming service can link to its website and account system inside of its app.  Apple had 64% of the market share for U.S. iPhones in the last quarter of 2023, versus 18% for Samsung, according to Counterpoint Research.  Apple isn’t the only big tech company facing government scrutiny. The DOJ filed an antitrust case against Google in 2020 over its dominant search position and another year over its advertising business. The DOJ also famously sued Microsoft in the 1990s, eventually forcing it to allow users to unbundle the Internet Explorer browser from the Windows operating system.

"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway cut Apple investment by about 13%";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cjze2n/warren_buffetts_berkshire_hathaway_cut_apple/";"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway cut its gigantic Apple stake in the first quarter as the “Oracle of Omaha” continued to downsize his one-time favorite bet.  In its first-quarter earnings report, Berkshire Hathaway reported that its Apple bet was worth $135.4 billion, implying around 790 million shares. That would mark a decline of around 13% in the stake. Apple was still Berkshire’s biggest holding by far at the end of the quarter.  This is the second quarter in a row that the Omaha-based conglomerate has trimmed the stake in the iPhone maker. It sold about 10 million Apple shares (just 1% of its massive stake) in the fourth quarter. This filing, when accounting for the change in Apple’s stock price, would imply Berkshire sold about 116 million shares.  The Oracle of Omaha became a big fan of Apple after one of his investing managers Ted Weschler or Todd Combs convinced him to buy the stock. Buffett even called the tech giant his second-most important business after Berkshire’s cluster of insurers.  Many has speculated that the 93-year-old investing icon reduced his favorite stake due to valuation concerns. Apple’s stock gained a whopping 48% in 2023 as megacap tech shares led the market rally. At its peak, Apple ballooned in Berkshire’s equity portfolio, taking up 50% of it. The shares are trading at more than 27 times forward earnings.  Shares of the iPhone maker got a big boost in the past week after the firm announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in company history. However, Apple posted a decline in overall sales and in iPhone sales. The shares are down more than 4% so far this year amid concerns about how it will revive growth.  It’s not without precedent that the Berkshire CEO would adjust the Apple bet. He sold a bit of the stock in the fourth quarter of 2020, but Buffett admitted then that it was “probably a mistake.” Also it’s not usual for Buffett to trim a position that has grown so large.  Even with the sale, Berkshire is still Apple’s largest shareholder outside of exchange-traded fund providers.

"Apple Cancels Work on Electric Car, Shifts Team to Generative AI";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b1klxa/apple_cancels_work_on_electric_car_shifts_team_to/";"# Apple Cancels Work on Electric Car, Shifts Team to Generative AI  &#x200B:  * Company is winding down work on decade-old Project Titan * Employees on some car teams will move to Apple’s AI division  &#x200B:  [(Bloomberg)](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai-1.2039986) \-- **Apple Inc. is canceling a decade-long effort to build an electric car**, according to people with knowledge of the matter, abandoning one of the most ambitious projects in the history of the company.  Apple made the disclosure internally Tuesday, surprising the nearly 2,000 employees working on the project, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the announcement wasn’t public. The decision was shared by Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and Kevin Lynch, a vice president in charge of the effort, according to the people.  The two executives told staffers that the project will begin winding down and that many employees on the team working on the car — known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG — will be shifted to the artificial intelligence division under executive John Giannandrea. Those employees will focus on generative AI projects, an increasingly key priority for the company.  The Apple car team also has several hundred hardware engineers and car designers. It’s possible that they will be able to apply for jobs on other Apple teams. There will be layoffs, but it’s unclear how many.  Apple, based in Cupertino, California, declined to comment.  The decision to ultimately wind down the project is a bombshell for the company, ending a multibillion-dollar effort that would have vaulted Apple into a whole new industry. The tech giant started working on a car around 2014, setting its sights on a fully autonomous electric vehicle with a limousine-like interior and voice-guided navigation.  But the project struggled nearly from the start, with Apple changing the team’s leadership and strategy several times. Lynch and Williams took over the undertaking a few years ago — following the departure of Doug Field, now a senior executive at Ford Motor Co.  The decision to wind down the project was finalized by Apple’s most senior executives in recent weeks, according to the people. It comes just a month after Bloomberg News reported that the project reached or a make-or-break point. The most recent approach discussed internally was delaying a car release until 2028 and reducing self-driving specifications from Level 4 to Level 2+ technology.  Most recently, Apple had imagined the car being priced at around $100,000. But executives were concerned about the vehicle being able to provide the profit margins that Apple typically enjoys on its products. The company’s board was also concerned about continuing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on a project that may never see the light of day.  &#x200B:  sources:  [https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai-1.2039986](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai-1.2039986)  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai?srnd=homepage-canada](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai?srnd=homepage-canada)  [https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/)  [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/apple-car-project-canceled-report.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/apple-car-project-canceled-report.html)  [https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project-titan/](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project-titan/)  [https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-apple-car-project-moves-team-to-generative-ai-projects/](https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-apple-car-project-moves-team-to-generative-ai-projects/)  [https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-cancels-work-ev-moves-staff-ai-project-bloomberg-reports-2024-02-27/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-cancels-work-ev-moves-staff-ai-project-bloomberg-reports-2024-02-27/)  [https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/apple-electric-car-cancel-2000-workers-ai/](https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/apple-electric-car-cancel-2000-workers-ai/)  [https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/apple-cancels-electric-car-generative-ai-1235924288/](https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/apple-cancels-electric-car-generative-ai-1235924288/)  [https://www.macworld.com/article/2249497/apple-car-project-canceled-generative-ai.html](https://www.macworld.com/article/2249497/apple-car-project-canceled-generative-ai.html)  [https://www.techradar.com/vehicle-tech/hybrid-electric-vehicles/apple-is-done-with-building-an-apple-car-according-to-a-report-and-everything-ive-been-telling-you-for-the-last-nine-years](https://www.techradar.com/vehicle-tech/hybrid-electric-vehicles/apple-is-done-with-building-an-apple-car-according-to-a-report-and-everything-ive-been-telling-you-for-the-last-nine-years)  [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/technology/personaltech/apple-ends-electric-car-plan.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/technology/personaltech/apple-ends-electric-car-plan.html)  [https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/apple-car-project-canceled-ced2b626](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/apple-car-project-canceled-ced2b626)  https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-cancellation-of-car-effort-boosts-urgency-of-bets-on-ai-headset-1.2040140";"1099";"2024-02-27T20:29:59"
"Apple hit with more than $1.95 billion EU antitrust fine over music streaming";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b6agqo/apple_hit_with_more_than_195_billion_eu_antitrust/";"The European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, on Monday hit Apple with a 1.8 billion euro ($1.95 billion) antitrust fine for abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.  The Commission said it found that Apple had applied restrictions on app developers that prevented them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app.  Apple also banned developers of music streaming apps from providing any instructions about how users could subscribe to these cheaper offers, the Commission alleged.  This is Apple’s first antitrust fine from Brussels and is among one of the biggest dished out to a technology company by the EU.  The European Commission opened an investigation into Apple after a complaint from Spotify in 2019. The probe was narrowed down to focus on contractual restrictions that Apple imposed on app developers which prevent them from informing iPhone and iPad users of alternative music subscription services at lower prices outside of the App Store.  Apple’s conduct lasted almost 10 years, according to the Commission, and “may have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions because of the high commission fee imposed by Apple on developers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher subscription prices for the same service on the Apple App Store.”  Apple response:  In a fiery response to the fine, Apple said Spotify would stand to gain the most from the EU pronouncement.  “The primary advocate for this decision — and the biggest beneficiary — is Spotify, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. Spotify has the largest music streaming app in the world, and has met with the European Commission more than 65 times during this investigation,” Apple said in a statement.  “Today, Spotify has a 56 percent share of Europe’s music streaming market — more than double their closest competitor’s — and pays Apple nothing for the services that have helped make them one of the most recognisable brands in the world.”  Apple said that a “large part” of Spotify’s success is thanks to the Cupertino giant’s App Store, “along with all the tools and technology that Spotify uses to build, update, and share their app with Apple users around the world.”  Apple said that Spotify pays it nothing. That’s because instead of selling subscriptions in their iOS app, Spotify sell them via their own website stead. Apple does not collect a commission on those purchases.  Developers over the years have spoken out against the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.  Spotify did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.  The fine will ramp up tensions between Big Tech and Brussels at a time when the EU is increasing scrutiny of these firms.  Last year, the Commission designated Apple among other tech firms like Microsoft and Meta as “gatekeepers” under a landmark regulation called the Digital Markets Act, which broadly came into effect last year.  The term gatekeepers refers to massive internet platforms which the EU believes are restricting access to core platform services, such as online search, advertising, and messaging and communications.  The Digital Markets Act aims to clamp down on anti-competitive practices from tech players, and force them to open out some of their services to other competitors. Smaller internet firms and other businesses have complained about being hurt by these companies’ business practices.  These laws have already had an impact on Apple. The Cupertino, California-based giant announced plans this year to open up its iPhone and iPad to alternative app stores other than its own. Developers have long-complained about the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.

With a market capitalization of $3.1 trillion, Apple is larger than all but the six largest stock markets in the world. This isn't the first time Apple surpassed Paris in terms of value: they swapped places several times during the previous year's second-half selloff.  The French stock market is likewise at an all-time high, driven by luxury goods giants such as LVMH and Hermes International SCA. This spike followed a mid-summer slowdown but has resumed as data suggests that inflation is decreasing and there are no signs of a US recession.  A comparable economic backdrop in the United States has resulted in a returning rally in technology companies, with Apple rising more than 50% in 2023, adding over $1 trillion to the market capital. This represents a major shift from October when Apple faced pressure over revenue growth and sales in China.  Looking ahead, Wall Street predicts that Apple's sales will re-accelerate in 2024, due to a shown rebound in demand for smartphones, laptops, and PCs. This upward trend for Apple mirrored larger developments in the technology sector amid strong economic conditions and a positive outlook for the business.";"1593";"2023-12-15T12:19:28"

The long-awaited lawsuit is a watershed moment for Apple. For years it was one of the few Big Tech companies to avoid major antitrust action by the US. Now it is under intense scrutiny from regulators in two of its key markets, the US and the EU. Its responses have indicated it is steeling itself for an existential battle.     Apple said the US case “threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets”. A loss would set a “dangerous precedent” by allowing the government to influence how technology markets developed, it added.     The new US lawsuit is broad and detailed, painting a picture of a company that has spent years knowingly heading off competitive threats to its ecosystem, be it on the App Store, in messaging with rival Android phones, on its “tap to pay” service, or in the smartwatch market.

The company consistently outperforms its peers and is one of only five US companies valued at over $1 trillion. Notably, on December 6, 2023, Apple surpassed a $3 trillion total market valuation.       Throughout 2023, Apple increased its market cap by $1 trillion, reaching a total valuation of $4 trillion expected in 2024 if the pace continues.       Other companies with over $1 trillion valuations include Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia. The gap between Apple and Microsoft is around $220 billion.       While these figures are interesting to observe, they don't mean much unless you're a stockholder. Apple's market cap is likely to reach $4 trillion in 2024 if its pace doesn't slow down, and with Apple Vision Pro on the horizon, anything is possible   ";"1651";"2023-12-14T12:35:56"
"Apple wins bid to pause Apple Watch ban at US appeals court";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18s76un/apple_wins_bid_to_pause_apple_watch_ban_at_us/";"Apple scored a victory on Wednesday when a U.S. appeals court paused a government commission's import ban on some of the company's popular Apple smartwatches following a patent dispute with medical-technology firm Masimo.  The tech giant had filed an emergency request asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to halt the order after appealing the U.S. International Trade Commission's (ITC) decision that it had infringed Masimo's patents.  Masimo declined to comment on the court's decision, while Apple did not immediately respond.  A final decision could cost either company millions of dollars and potentially force a settlement or some kind of technological workaround by Apple, analysts said.  Masimo shares were down almost 4% following the decision, and Apple shares were largely flat.  ""This is a big win for Apple that was unexpected by many given the legal issues involved in this patent battle,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said. ""Masimo now has a big fight ahead. We expect an appeals case in January to be a big moment.""  In a four-paragraph ruling, the appeals court said it would halt the ban while it considers Apple's motion for a longer-term pause during the appeals process. The court gave the ITC until Jan. 10 to respond to Apple's request.  U.S. President Joe Biden's administration declined to veto the ban on Tuesday, allowing it to take effect. Apple asked for a pause of the ban later that day.  On Tuesday, Apple told the court that U.S. Customs and Border Protection is considering whether redesigned versions of its watches infringe Masimo's patents and can be imported. The customs agency has set a target date of Jan. 12 for its decision, Apple said.  Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees, stealing its pulse oximetry technology and incorporating it into Apple Watches.  The ITC barred imports and sales of Apple Watches with technology for reading blood-oxygen levels. Apple has included a pulse oximeter feature in its smartwatches starting with its Series 6 model in 2020.  Apple can also now sell the Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches in the U.S., after pausing sales last week due to the ITC decision. The watches had remained available at other retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, Costco and Walmart.  The ban did not affect the Apple Watch SE, a less-expensive model without a pulse oximeter. Previously sold watches also were not be affected by the ban.  If the import ban remains in place, it could cost Apple from high hundreds of millions of dollars to very low billions of dollars, Ben Bajarin, CEO of analyst firm Creative Strategies, said before the decision was announced.  ""Going forward, it's absolutely certain they are going to have to take a different approach in future hardware to still enable this feature,"" he said of Apple.  A jury trial on Masimo's allegations against Apple in California federal court ended with a mistrial in May. Apple has separately sued Masimo for patent infringement in federal court in Delaware and called Masimo's legal actions a ""maneuver to clear a path"" for its own competing smartwatch.  Apple's wearables, home and accessory business, which includes the Apple Watch, AirPods earbuds and other products, brought in $8.28 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2023, according to a company report.  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-wins-bid-pause-apple-163531965.html";"338";"2023-12-27T19:17:36"
"Why Apple simply doesn't provide a cloud service?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bbz8zd/why_apple_simply_doesnt_provide_a_cloud_service/";"With AAPL growing now at what I consider to be a  ""GDP premium rate"" ~ 5% and with the iphone growth slowing down, what is left now for Apple is to capitalize on its services. This is now under attack in the EU. I am not a financial specialist but as a European I do however foresee a hard time for Apple to grow services revenue in the EU. Now that Apple has to offer search choices, that revenue with Google might also see some decline. With the self-driving car cancelled, it is hard to picture any sectors where Apple could still push double digit growth. VisionPro? too expensive at the moment, it would still to be at least in the $1000 range for the mass. While we have seen positive news on the tech, it is still unknown how many people who bought the device hasn't yet returned it.  GenAI? They reshuffled the entire team working on Titan to focus on GenAI. How is that possible? are the skills really transferable? Vision Problem != LLM but again not an expert.  This led me to wonder, why isn't Apple competing in the cloud business? I don't mean like AWS or Azure but for its developers? When a developer onboard on IOS, they make use of the store and the SDK but all cloud services the app uses is running somewhere else. Wouldn't Apple be able to justify 30%+ cut of the developer's revenue if part of the deal was access to Apple cloud infrastructure to run the App services?  Do you guys think this is far fetched? What other sectors do you guys think Apple can still tap in to to go back to double digit growth?  Leadership wise, i am a bit split. Post Steve Jobs, all they had truly done was innovate on the iPhone and in a way that phone was conceptualized during Steve's time. So what exactly did Tim Cook do? I would still pick Tim Cook over Sundar but he is not Satya who was more of an opportunist that turned Microsoft around.  Anyway, lots of questions and a bit of a rant. Curious what you geniuses think of what lies ahead of the big Apple.";"249";"2024-03-11T10:33:53"
"Apple Unveils Vision Pro AR/VR Headset, Its First Major New Product In Nearly A Decade";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/141nmds/apple_unveils_vision_pro_arvr_headset_its_first/";"On Monday, Apple unveiled its much-anticipated mixed reality headset, the Vision Pro, the tech giant’s first major new product category since 2015’s Apple Watch.  The new device, packed with cameras and sensors, looks like a futuristic pair of ski goggles, and can immerse a wearer in virtual reality but also blend in the real-world elements of augmented reality. CEO Tim Cook announced the new product at the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference held at its sparkling Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino, CA.  Apple’s virtual reality plans date back roughly a decade, and Cook has been teasing his ambitions publicly for the better part of that time. As far back as 2016, the company filed patents for lightweight eyeglasses and a bulkier device. But while Cook reportedly preferred the more compact option, according to reports by Bloomberg, the technical challenge forced Apple to change its strategy.  The device announcement comes years after other Silicon Valley juggernauts including Meta and Google parent Alphabet have tried to bring high-tech headsets into the mainstream. Facebook in 2014 bought the startup Oculus for $2 billion and has released two generations of its Meta Quest, geared mostly toward gamers. Microsoft in 2016 made a big bet on its Hololens headset, a 3D augmented reality device, but has failed to gain traction with consumers. Google made the buzziest splash more than a decade ago with its disastrous Google Glass, a sleek headset with a camera on board. The product drew immediate outrage, with early adopters dubbed “glassholes.”  Apple has rarely been first to new product categories, instead letting other companies take the lead while it developed products it hoped could dominate over rivals. Apple was beat to market in mp3 players, smartphones, tablets and smartwatches, but its iPods, iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches have all become category-defining devices.  Apple will have a bigger challenge ahead as it asks people to put its latest product directly on their faces for everyday use—an aim which has eluded all its well-capitalized predecessors. Today’s headsets often lead to people complaining about the devices overheating, being too heavy to wear for too long or leaving sweaty foreheads. Others have found the experience of being disconnected to the real world—immersed in full-on virtual reality for long periods of time—too isolating. Cook said in an interview with GQ earlier this year that Apple’s device could increase collaboration, though Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision to achieve a similar effect in the workplace has failed to take off.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2023/06/05/apple-unveils-reality-pro-arvr-headset-its-first-major-new-product-in-nearly-a-decade/?sh=15606f2d37e8";"1146";"2023-06-05T20:29:40"

Marketing Challenge: Apple has priced the Vision Pro, which has ”limited battery life, an unwieldy design and no killer app,” at* ***$3,499***, *Gurman said in the* *weekly Power On newsletter*.  *The company is bracing for an initial sales surge, courtesy of the early adopters, followed by a tapering off of demand, he said, adding that retail stores may need twice as much inventory space “during the opening weekend than afterward.”*  *With Apple’s previous devices such as the iPod, the iPad, the iPhone and even the Watch, shoppers didn’t require a lot of ”coaxing and coaching,” the columnist noted.*  *”The Vision Pro will be a different beast. Few consumers are accustomed to wearing a mixed-reality headset, and Apple's model requires particular care,” Gurman said.* *“If the device isn't fitted to someone's head correctly — or is missing the right lenses — the entire experience could be ruined, potentially costing Apple a $3,499 sale forever.”*  *Apple Does Groundwork: ”Apple has prepared its most sophisticated sales pitch ever, including a demo lasting up to 25 minutes — longer than it takes to watch your favorite sitcom,” Gurman said. The company has also trained several hundred employees at its offices in Cupertino, he added. “To make sure retail staffers get everything right,” Apple hosted several hundred employees at its offices this month in Cupertino to walk them through the process, the columnist said.*  *Gurman noted that the customer* ***demos will begin at Apple’s U.S. retail stores on the launch date***, *with sign-ups beginning at 8 a.m. local time. More than a dozen demo units will be made available simultaneously at the largest stores, with dedicated sit-down areas where presentations will take place, he said*.  ***The Modus Operandi: Gurman outlined the demo process as follows:*** *retail store worker scans user’s face with an app, similar to setting up Face ID. Scan will help decide on the light seal, foam cushion and band size that suits the customer*. *If the user wears glasses, the store worker will use a device to scan lenses for prescription information. All these details gathered by the worker will be handed over to a staffer in the store’s backroom to assemble the demo Vision Pro with correct accessories. The store employee will then hand the demo device to the customer and explain how the interface works, including how to control the pointer using a user's eyes, how to gesture to make selections and how to hold the headset. Once the headset is on, the customer will need to calibrate the device with various tracking and tapping exercises so it can follow their eyes and hands. As the 20- to 25-minute demo begins, the user will be directed to the photo apps followed by examples of panorama shots. The customer will then see 3D images, following which the user will be shown how to use the device as a computer or iPad replacement. The customer will then be shown 3D and immersive movies, including clips of wild animals, the ocean and sports. Demo devices will be preloaded with various third-party apps that are launching with the device next month*.  *”The goal of the demos is giving users an experience that's compelling but not exhausting — ideally leaving them itching for more,” Gurman said. The key issue, the columnist said, is making sure customers stay comfortable while wearing the Vision Pro. This, however, could be challenging, as several retail employees have already said that they felt their heads were tired and sweaty after only using the device for a half hour, he said. Apple also aims to ensure that product reviewers will get the best experience by having them participate in two in-person sessions with the company before being sent a device, Gurman said.*  *Still, none of these measures will ensure success within the next year or two as the product is just too expensive and cumbersome to win over mainstream consumers, he said.*  *“But looking out a few years — once the price and weight go down, and there are more compelling features — Apple may have laid the groundwork for something big,” the Apple specialist said.*  *Apple ended Friday’s session up 0.18% at $185.92, according to Benzinga Pro.*  ***..........End of article........***  ***Source:*** [*https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-preps-most-sophisticated-sales-pitch-ever-for-vision-pro-debut-on-feb.-2-with-demo*](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-preps-most-sophisticated-sales-pitch-ever-for-vision-pro-debut-on-feb.-2-with-demo)";"436";"2024-01-16T17:37:05"
"Apple reaches $490mn settlement over Tim Cook’s China demand comments";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bfx68c/apple_reaches_490mn_settlement_over_tim_cooks/";"Apple has agreed to pay $490mn to settle a class action accusing chief executive Tim Cook of misleading investors in 2018 by exaggerating demand for the iPhone in China.   Investors claimed Cook overstated demand for Apple’s products in the country on a November 2018 earnings call, only for the company’s stock to fall almost 10 per cent in January 2019 when it said it would miss its revenue guidance by as much as $9bn.   Apple declined to comment on Friday. It has denied violating US securities law.   The settlement still requires approval from the California federal judge overseeing the case. According to data from Deutsche Börse-owned Institutional Shareholder Services, it would mark Apple’s largest US securities fraud class action settlement.   The years-long securities litigation, led by the UK’s Norfolk County Council, came after a rare and unexpected warning Apple issued on Chinese sales in January 2019. It was the first cut to Apple’s revenue forecast in 16 years and sent its shares sliding.   At the time, China’s overall economic growth was slowing amid a trade war with the US administration of Donald Trump. The investors suing Apple claimed that Cook had downplayed concerns about China, citing a “strong” recent quarter in the region.  &#x200B:  Article without paywall here: [https://www.archivebuttons.com/articles?article=https://www.ft.com/content/e41ce6f5-84d1-48b6-a81f-53cb7cdbb6a3](https://www.archivebuttons.com/articles?article=https://www.ft.com/content/e41ce6f5-84d1-48b6-a81f-53cb7cdbb6a3)  Source: [https://www.ft.com/content/e41ce6f5-84d1-48b6-a81f-53cb7cdbb6a3](https://www.ft.com/content/e41ce6f5-84d1-48b6-a81f-53cb7cdbb6a3)      ";"473";"2024-03-16T04:51:27"
"Tim Cook teases Apple AI announcement ‘later this year’";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1agtkhe/tim_cook_teases_apple_ai_announcement_later_this/";"Apple CEO Tim Cook teased that Apple may have an artificial intelligence announcement later this year during a call with analysts after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings.  While Cook’s remarks on Thursday did not include many details, they did indicate that Apple wants to compete with Microsoft, Google, Amazon, OpenAI and other technology companies working on cutting-edge AI models that can generate text and images.  “As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future,” Cook said during a call with analysts. “That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we’re excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.”  Generative AI started drawing significant attention from technology companies and investors starting in 2022, after OpenAI released ChatGPT and image generators rapidly improved. Apple did not announce an advanced AI model last year, although the company has long invested in similar machine learning technology in its chips and software, which can, for example, identify people or pets inside photographs.  Apple typically announces new software in June at its annual developer’s conference, WWDC. Last year, the company announced an autocorrect feature for the iPhone keyboard based on a transformer-based language model, which shares the same underlying technology as GPT. But Apple never used the phrase “artificial intelligence” during the presentation, preferring the more academic term “machine learning.”  “Let me just say that I think there’s a huge opportunity for Apple with Gen AI and AI, without getting into more details and getting out in front of myself,” Cook said.

The talks never reached an advanced stage, according to the report.  The revelation comes as the U.S. Department of Justice seeks to prove to a federal judge that Google violated antitrust laws by abusing its dominance over the search market. Google’s deal with Apple to share ad revenue in exchange for default status in Safari, and whether that agreement made it impossible for challengers like Bing to compete, have been a key part of the ongoing antitrust trial in Washington. Microsoft’s alleged sale effort appears to bolster the government’s contention that Google locked up the market to the point where its top competitor was willing to throw in the towel. It also shows that Apple, the world’s most valuable company, preferred to stick with the Google deal than pick a costly battle in search.

"EU launches probe into Meta, Apple and Alphabet under sweeping new tech law";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bnaa9e/eu_launches_probe_into_meta_apple_and_alphabet/";"The European Union on Monday opened an investigation into Apple, Alphabet and Meta, in its first probe under the sweeping new Digital Markets Act tech legislation.  “Today, the Commission has opened non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) into Alphabet’s rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing on Google Search, Apple’s rules on steering in the App Store and the choice screen for Safari and Meta’s ‘pay or consent model’,” the Commission said in a statement.  The first two probes focus on Alphabet and Apple and relate to so-called “anti-steering rules.” Under the DMA, tech firms are not allowed to block businesses from telling their users about cheaper options for their products or about subscriptions outside of an app store.  “The way that Apple and Alphabet’s implemented the DMA rules on anti-steering seems to be at odds with the letter of the law. Apple and Alphabet will still charge various recurring fees, and still limit steering,” EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said during a press conference on Monday.  Apple has already fallen foul of the EU’s rules on this. This month, the company was fined 1.8 billion euros ($1.95 billion) after the European Commission said it found that Apple had applied restrictions on app developers that prevented them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app.  The third probe focuses on Alphabet. The European Commission said it is looking into whether Alphabet’s display of Google search results “may lead to self-preferencing in relation to Google’s” other services such as Google Shopping over similar rival services.  The fourth probe focuses on Apple. The  Commission said it is investigating whether the company has complied with obligations under the DMA to ensure that users can easily uninstall app on iOS and can easily change default settings on iOS. The probe also focuses on whether Apple is actively prompting users with choices to allow them to change default services on iOS, such as for the web browser or search engine.  The Commission said that it is “concerned that Apple’s measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may be preventing users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem.”  The fifth and final investigation focuses on Meta and its so-called “pay and consent” model. Last year, Meta introduced an ad-free subscription model for Facebook and Instagram in Europe. The Commission is looking into whether offering the subscription model without ads or making users consent to terms and conditions for the free service, is in violation of the DMA.  “The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.”  Thierry Breton, the EU’s internal market commissioner, said during a press conference that there should be “free alternative options” offered by Meta for its services that are “less personalized.”  Gatekeepers is the term used to label large tech firms that are required to comply with the DMA in the EU.   “We will continue to use all available tools, should any gatekeeper try to circumvent or undermine the obligations of the DMA,” Vestager said.

Apple is specifically looking to partner on cloud-based generative AI, with today’s report citing text and image generation as examples of what Gemini could be used for. At the same time, Apple is working on offering its own on-device AI models and capabilities with the upcoming iOS 18 release. The discussions are still underway, and it’s unclear how the AI agreement will be branded. This would be a significant expansion of the existing relationship — default search engine — between the two companies. Looking at the rest of the industry, Google announced a partnership with Samsung in February to have Gemini power summarization features in the Galaxy S24’s notes and voice recording apps, as well as keyboard. Samsung is also using Imagen 2 text-to-image diffusion for a generative editing feature in the photo gallery app. Those features all require server-side processing, but Samsung is also using an on-device version of Gemini. Google offers Gemini in three sizes, with Pro being used by most first and third-party apps.

Delivery dates for all three models quickly slipped to March 8-15 for online orders, and the device was sold out for in-store pickup on day one at many locations. The delay signals that either demand is strong or supplies are limited — or something in between.*  *Apple shares gained as much as 1.8% to $191.95 Friday in New York, erasing most of its 2% decline for January.*       *With the launch, the company disclosed two additional configurations: a version with 512 gigabytes of storage for $3,699, and a top-end model with 1 terabyte of space for $3,899. The base model includes 256 gigabytes of storage. The company also said it would sell a carrying case for $199 and additional batteries for $199, while extra bands will cost $99 a piece.*       *The purchasing process for the Vision Pro is unique. Customers need to use a recent iPhone or iPad to scan their head and, if necessary, provide a vision prescription. Apple typically doesn’t comment on the sales performance of new products.*   *Wall Street analysts are predicting a slow start for the device. UBS Group AG analyst David Vogt expects Apple to ship 300,000 to 400,000 units this year, generating as much as $1.4 billion. For a company that had sales of $383 billion last year, that’s “immaterial.”*  *Still, the idea is to set the stage for something bigger. Apple is entering its first major new product category since the company began selling smartwatches in 2015, and the Vision Pro may take years to catch on. Apple will continue to refine the headset — making it cheaper and more comfortable — and find compelling applications for the device.*      *In the longer run, Apple could use a fresh moneymaker. The smartphone market has matured, and it’s under particular pressure in China. The company’s revenue has fallen for four straight quarters — its longest streak of declines in more than two decades.*  *Initially, the Cupertino, California-based company only plans to sell the Vision Pro in the US, with launches in other markets coming in the months ahead. The company is eyeing the UK, Canada and China as some of the first other countries, Bloomberg News has reported.*      *It’s a complex product to manufacture, which could limit early supplies. The dual 4K resolution displays in the headset, which melds virtual and augmented reality, have suffered production snags. But the fact that Apple has been ramping up manufacturing for months suggests that it will be able to satisfy initial demand. The company is also offering a 25% discount on the device for employees, signaling that supplies aren’t too tight.*  *Inside Apple, executives are anticipating a strong opening weekend, with sales tapering off later. At $3,499, the Vision Pro is one of the priciest consumer headsets ever — about seven times more expensive than the latest device from VR market leader Meta Platforms Inc.*      *The Vision Pro also will be a hard product to share with family and friends. It requires a precise fitting process to ensure a good experience. The face scan is designed to determine the best light seal and strap size for users. The company has prepared 25 different light seals — a cushion that prevents light from seeping into the wearer’s field of view — in addition to two straps. There also are prescription lens inserts, at an additional cost.*       *And the headset may be hard for some people to wear for extended periods. In early testing, some users have found it to be too heavy.*      *Another concern that’s cropped up in recent days is a lack of support from top streaming apps. Netflix Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Google’s YouTube are opting not to release software for the device, at least at launch.*      *But Apple has carefully refined its sales pitch for the headset. When consumers try it out at Apple retail stores, they’ll get a 25-minute demo, letting them get comfortable with the 3D experience that the company calls “spatial computing.”*      *To commemorate the launch, Apple executives Mike Rockwell and Alan Dye discussed the device in a Q&A shared with employees this week.*      *A key focus, said Dye, was ensuring that the Vision Pro didn’t have a closed-in feel — a complaint with VR headsets.*      *“From the onset, we all had concerns about people sitting with their eyes covered and disconnected from the world,” he said. “It really became central to how we thought about the core principles of the product.”*      *That led to the EyeSight system, which can show a wearer’s eyes through a screen on the front of the Vision Pro. “It was a huge technical challenge to do this in a way that looks and feels natural,” Rockwell said.*      *Apple also developed an interface that doesn’t require handheld accessories. Instead, it tracks eye movement and hand gestures. Users control the device by looking at an on-screen item and pinching their fingers together to select it.*      *One of the biggest selling points may be how easy it makes collaboration, Rockwell said. Users in far-flung locations can feel like they’re in the same place.*      *“It’s the closest thing to being there in person that you can possibly have,” Rockwell said. “It changes the way you collaborate and is very different from videoconferencing as we know it.”*  .................................  *https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/apple-to-get-first-taste-of-consumer-demand-for-3499-vision-pro/ar-BB1gVwvZ*  &#x200B:";"266";"2024-01-21T16:15:31"
"Apple beats estimates thanks to iPhone and services, but records fourth consecutive quarterly sales decline";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17md16v/apple_beats_estimates_thanks_to_iphone_and/";"[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/02/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/02/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q4-2023.html)  Apple    reported fourth fiscal quarter earnings on Thursday that beat analyst expectations for sales and earnings per share, but revealed that overall sales fell for the fourth quarter in a row. Every hardware business outside the iPhone declined year-over-year, with big drops in the iPad and Mac segments.       Apple highlighted stronger-than-expected 16% growth in its online services division to make up for weakness in hardware sales.        Apple shares fell less than 1% in extended trading.      Here’s how Apple did, versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations:       EPS: $1.46 per share, versus $1.39 per share expected    Revenue: $89.50 billion, versus $89.28 billion expected    iPhone revenue: $43.81 billion, versus $43.81 billion expected    Mac revenue: $7.61 billion versus $8.63 billion expected    iPad revenue: $6.44 billion, versus $6.07 billion expected    Wearables revenue: $9.32 billion, versus $9.43 billion expected    Services revenue: $22.31 billion, versus $21.35 billion expected    Gross margin: 45.2% versus 44.5% expected    Apple didn’t give formal guidance, but CFO Luca Maestri usually provides data points on the earnings call. Analysts are looking for $122.98 billion in revenue for the December quarter, which would be a return to year-over-year growth in Apple’s most important quarter.        Net income was $22.96 billion, versus $20.72 billion in net income a year ago. For Apple’s entire fiscal year, it reported $383.29 billion in sales, down about 3% from Apple’s fiscal 2022. Quarterly revenue declined less than 1% in the September quarter.       The company’s iPhone sales were in line with Wall Street expectations and increased more than 2% from last year. It was the only hardware line for Apple to show growth in the quarter, and the period only included about a week of iPhone 15 sales.        Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC that the iPhone 15 was doing better than the iPhone 14 did during the September quarter last year.        “If you look at iPhone 15 for that period of time and compare it to iPhone 14 for the same time in the year-ago quarter, iPhone 15 did better than iPhone 14,” Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach. He added that Apple’s more expensive Pro and Pro Max iPhones were supply constrained because of high demand.        Apple’s Mac and iPad businesses both suffered during the quarter. Maestri, Apple’s CFO, had warned on a call with analysts after third-quarter results that iPad and Mac sales would fall by double-digit percentages.       Mac sales came in below Wall Street expectations, falling nearly 34% on an annual basis. Apple held an unusual nighttime launch event for its new MacBook Pro laptops and iMac desktop last month. While sales of the new devices aren’t included in the quarter, Apple was signaling that new products could boost sales once again thanks to its new M3 chips.       Cook told CNBC that the Mac comparison is to “an all-time record” fourth quarter, which followed a huge supply disruption and pushed what would have been third-quarter sales into the last quarter of 2022. “So, the comparison point here is very difficult,” he said.       “I think the Mac is going to have a significantly better quarter in the December quarter. We’ve got the M3, we’ve got the new products, and we don’t have the compare phenomenon on a year-over-year basis,” Cook said, referring to an unusually strong market for Macs in 2022.        Cook said that that overall market for personal computers is “challenging.”       Revenue from iPads was also down big, declining 10% from the same period last year. Apple did not announce new products ahead of the holiday season this year.        Apple’s services business was a bright spot. Apple recorded $22.31 billion in services revenue, outpacing analyst expectations and increasing over 16% on an annual basis.        Apple’s services division includes online subscriptions like iCloud storage and Apple Music, as well as warranties from AppleCare. A big chunk of Apple’s services business comes from its deal with Google for the default search engine on Apple’s browser, Safari, which has been highlighted in recent weeks as part of the Department of Justice antitrust case against Google. That payment to Apple is worth an estimated $19 billion this year.       Cook said services components including App Store sales, advertising (including the Google deal), iCloud, payment services, and Apple Music did well in the quarter and hit an internal Apple record, signaling continued growth.       “Every main service hit a record,” Cook said.        Maestri also noted in a statement that Apple’s installed base of devices, or the number of iPhones, Macs, and iPads currently in active use, reached an all-time high during the quarter, although Apple did not give an exact number. Analysts say that growth in Apple’s installed base signals future growth in its services division.        Cook said that Apple had over a billion paid subscriptions, which include both Apple’s own services as well as apps on the App Store that bill on a recurring basis.        Apple’s wearables business unit includes headphones like the company’s AirPods as well as Apple Watch sales. It, too, shrank year-over-year, dropping over 3% on an annual basis.        Apple’s business in Greater China, its third largest market, is under the microscope as investors worry about increased competition from Huawei. Greater China sales were basically flat year-over-year, and Apple reported $15.08 billion from the region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.        Apple said it would pay a dividend of 24 cents per share this month and said the company had spent $25 billion during the quarter on share repurchases and dividends.  ";"662";"2023-11-02T21:34:03"
"Meta, Microsoft and Amazon team up on maps project to crack Apple-Google duopoly";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15abmox/meta_microsoft_and_amazon_team_up_on_maps_project/";"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/meta-microsoft-amazon-join-overture-maps-to-vie-with-apple-google.html  Google and Apple dominate the market for online maps, charging mobile app developers for access to their mapping services. The other mega-cap tech companies are joining together to help create another option. A group formed by Meta, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, along with TomTom, is releasing data that could enable companies to build their own maps, without having to rely on Google or Apple. The Overture Maps Foundation, which was established late last year, captured 59 million “points of interest,” such as restaurants, landmarks, streets and regional borders. The data has been cleaned and formatted so it can be used for free as the base layer for a new map application.  Meta and Microsoft collected and donated the data to Overture, according to Marc Prioleau, executive director of the OMF. Data on places is often difficult to collect and license, and building map data requires lots of time and staff to gather and clean it, he told CNBC in an interview. “We have some companies that, if they wanted to invest to build the map data, they could,” Prioleau said. Rather than spending that kind of money, he said, companies were asking, “Can we just get collaboration around the open base map?” Overture is aiming to establish a baseline for maps data so that companies can use it to build and operate their own maps.  For many companies, Google’s and Apple’s maps aren’t ideal, because they don’t provide access to the underlying data. Instead, those companies allow app makers to use their maps as a service and, in many cases, charge each time the underlying map is accessed. For example, app makers pay per thousand Google Maps lookups through an application programming interface (API). Apple allows access to Apple Maps for free for native app developers, but web app developers need to pay. “That works for a lot of people, but not for others,” Prioleau said. Overture is only offering the underlying map data, leaving it up to companies to build their own software on top of it.";"798";"2023-07-26T19:13:04"
"What’s the future of Apple?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b7d0v8/whats_the_future_of_apple/";"The world is going into the AI era, and I just don’t see Apple in it.  It seems iPhone is close to its fullest potential, they are throwing the same phone out for many years now, and people are much less hyped about it. While back then, it was worth it to get the new one every year for the upgrades, now new iPhones are just A(n+1) processor, new colors, and a bit better camera. They look the same too, so it has lost its “status symbol” attribute too. I don’t see it changing soon. Pretty much same with iPads. Apple Watch is like.. it’s a watch, they can improve on it, but I don’t see people sitting on needles waiting when the new one will come out. They can improve battery life, make it brighter every year as the sun, make it do something with every sort of sign language hand movements (why though?) but that’s it. Macs aren’t going to save them either, they are faster for sure, but there’s not a huge market for them, or in other words, no massive growth is expected. There’s potential in VR, but in my opinion VR is very very far from being able to be an everyday wearable, and it’s for sure they won’t be the ones developing VR to that point. Why? Well, that’s my main point. Apple has never been an innovator, they were always the last to adapt something, and only when they were able to “perfect it” (even though they have massively failed many times). I’m just afraid they aren’t good positioned for either promising areas: AI, and VR. My theory is they will be afraid of AI, because it’s something that’s much harder to control, and perfect. I don’t see how Apple, being a control freak, would be able to live with something that’s not predictable. For VR, I think they will wait until they will be way late from the game. They will come out with something that’s 5 years behind, but I’m not sure they will be able to get away with it (as they were able to do with iPhones - which I cannot understand how they did till this day). They also don’t have a shovel in the AI gold rush as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia do. I’m genuinely worried about the future of Apple, and seems like they can be the next Nokia. Just to clarify, I’m not anti Apple, I’m the one who buys all the crap they throw out (iPhone, watch, beats, Mac, iPad), that’s why I see they are getting less and less exciting.

Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month, according to a regulatory disclosure Thursday.      The transactions on the filing, marked with ""SP"" for the spouse, indicate that Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options purchased on May 24, 2022, with a listed expiration date of June 16.      The Apple options had a strike price of $80, and the Microsoft options had a strike price of $180. On Friday, those shares closed at $186.68 and $335.02, respectively, totaling about $933,000 and $1.7 million.      Since the options were purchased last May, Apple shares have gained 33%, and Microsoft has climbed 29%. The upside from the strike price is even higher, at 131% and 83%, respectively.      First highlighted by Quiver Quantitative and Unusual Whales, the disclosure comes after Congress failed to make progress on new legislation around lawmakers and their relatives trading stocks.      Earlier this year, Insider and several other news organizations identified 78 members of Congress who didn't properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act.      Congress passed the law a decade ago to combat insider trading and conflicts of interest. But many lawmakers have not fully complied with reporting requirements, leading to calls for a complete ban on trading individual stocks among members of Congress.      Legislation on such a ban advanced last year, but the bill ultimately died.      Meanwhile, Paul Pelosi has faced backlash over stock trades that seem to coincide with legislation in the technology sector.      For example, in July 2021, he pocketed a $4.8 million gain in a Alphabet stock trade the week before the House Judiciary Committee advanced bipartisan antitrust bills targeting Google, Apple, and Amazon.      However, Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly that her financier husband's trades have nothing to do with her political knowledge.      OpenSecrets estimated that Pelosi has a net worth of $114.6 million.";"2435";"2023-06-27T11:34:17"

Google pays Apple more than a third of its search advertising revenue from Safari under the terms of the two companies’ search default agreement, an Alphabet  witness said in open court Monday amid a protracted antitrust battle between Google and the Department of Justice.  The 36% figure, which was not previously known to the public, is one of the clearest indications of how lucrative Google’s search deal has been for both Apple and the search engine company. Both companies have fought to limit revealing the deals’ details, citing potentially anticompetitive effects.  The incidental disclosure from Alphabet’s expert witness Kevin Murphy, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, was not expected. Murphy’s testimony came as part of the company’s efforts to fight the Justice Department’s claims that the company illegally maintains dominance over search and advertising markets.  Williams & Connolly antitrust partner John Schmidtlein visibly cringed when Murphy revealed the number, Bloomberg News reported.  The search default agreement is a major focus of the proceedings. Judge Amit Mehta has described the Apple-Google deal as the “heart” of the case. It’s a number Wall Street pays attention to as well. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi has estimated in a note to clients that Apple would see $19 billion in 2023 revenue as a result of the search engine default deal with Google.  Neither Apple nor Google immediately responded to a request for comment.  Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai defended such deals when he testified in the proceedings. But Google’s competitors have described the arrangement as damaging to their business. Microsoft  CEO Satya Nadella, for example, pushed back in detail when he testified in October.  Nadella said that “every year” he had held the top job at Microsoft, he had “dialogues” with Apple over a default search engine deal for Microsoft’s Bing, even if that meant billions in short-term losses. Nothing had yet come of those talks, Nadella said.  Nadella said that the idea of an “open web” was a misnomer. “Everybody talks about the open web, but there really is the Google web,” he said on the stand.";"552";"2023-11-14T16:30:14"

"Will Apple be a $4 trillion dollar stock by 2024?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14e7eyk/will_apple_be_a_4_trillion_dollar_stock_by_2024/";"* Apple’s market cap rose from $1 trillion in 2018 to $3 trillion in 2022. * Reaching the $4 trillion market cap by 2024 could be very challenging. * New products, services, and acquisitions could help it reach that milestone.     # The law of large numbers hasn't caught up to Apple yet.  Apple ($AAPL) became the first publicly traded U.S. company to hit a $1 trillion market cap in August 2018. It also became the first to cross the $2 trillion mark in August 2020, and the first to reach the $3 trillion milestone in January 2022.      Apple's market cap is still hovering near the $3 trillion mark as of this writing, but could it maintain its biennial tradition and hit a $4 trillion market cap by 2024? Let's review its past growth, projected growth rates, and valuations to decide.  # How did Apple become a $3 trillion company?  Between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2022 (which ended last September), Apple's annual revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5%. Meanwhile, its split-adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew at an even higher CAGR of 21.6%.      In other words, Apple's annual EPS nearly tripled from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2022 -- so it makes sense that its stock price nearly quadrupled over the past five years. However, Apple's valuations have also risen at a faster rate than its actual profits. On the last day of fiscal 2017, Apple's stock traded at $154.12 ($38.53 on a split-adjusted basis), which was only 13 times the diluted EPS of $11.91 it would generate in fiscal 2018. Today, Apple trades at 28 times forward earnings.  Apple's path from $1 trillion to $3 trillion was paved by both its own EPS growth and its rising valuations. Its earnings growth was driven by its robust sales of iPhones (which still account for over half its revenue), iPads, Macs, and the expansion of its services segment with more subscription-based services. Its valuations rose as more investors turned to Apple as a safe-haven bet while the pandemic, the Russo-Ukrainian war, inflation, and rising interest rates rattled the broader markets.   Apple's EPS also usually grows at a faster clip than its net income because it buys back billions of dollars in shares every year. It repurchased 19% of its shares over the past five years, as well as a whopping 38% of its shares over the past decade.  # How could Apple become a $4 trillion company?  For Apple to reach a $4 trillion market cap by the end of 2024, its stock would need to rise nearly 40% over the next 18 months. That could be quite difficult, for two simple reasons.      First, analysts expect Apple's EPS to dip 2% in fiscal 2023, rise 9% in fiscal 2024, and grow 10% to $7.17 per share in fiscal 2025. Assuming Apple still trades at 28 times forward earnings by the beginning of fiscal 2025, its stock would only be trading 9% higher at about $200 -- which would give it a market cap of just under $3.2 trillion.      Second, Apple's valuations are historically high -- so I could see its forward multiple drop back to 20 during a market downturn. If that happens, Apple's stock could decline to the mid-$140s, and its market cap would shrink to about $2.2 trillion.  # Pay attention to the wild cards  Based on analysts' estimates, should take with a grain of salt, it seems unlikely that Apple will reach a $4 trillion valuation by the end of 2024. However, those forecasts don't account for all the wild cards that Apple can still play.       Apple's upcoming rollout of the Vision Pro headset in early 2024 will mark its first major hardware launch since its introduction of the Apple Watch in 2015. Its high price tag of $3,500 might limit its initial appeal, but a stronger-than-expected launch could drive analysts to boost their revenue and earnings estimates.      Apple also ended its latest quarter with 975 million paid subscriptions across all of its services, which represented 18% growth from a year ago. That massive audience gives it plenty of room to launch new apps and services.      Lastly, Apple is still sitting on $166 billion in cash and marketable securities. It could deploy a lot of that cash on fresh investments and acquisitions (perhaps on media companies for its services ecosystem or some chipmakers for its first-party chips).   # Look beyond Apple's market cap  I believe Apple will eventually be worth $4 trillion one day, but I don't expect it to reach that milestone by the end of 2024. Instead, investors should simply recall that Apple generates stable growth, commands fierce customer loyalty, locks in its customers with sticky services, and rewards its patient investors with buybacks and dividends. All of those strengths make Apple a great long-term investment -- regardless of how much the entire company is actually worth.";"244";"2023-06-20T12:28:39"

"Apple TV Plus and Paramount Plus reportedly discussing cheap bundle plan to take on Netflix";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/188i79a/apple_tv_plus_and_paramount_plus_reportedly/";"https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus-and-paramount-plus-reportedly-discussing-cheap-bundle-plan-to-take-on-netflix  According to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), two of the world's most underrated streamers have held talks about creating a cost-effective bundle to put a stop to Netflix's dominance of the streaming landscape. People familiar with the discussions reportedly told the WSJ that Apple TV Plus and Paramount Plus aren't just looking to end Netflix's reign as the world's best streaming service. Per the US outlet's sources, the duo are also said to want to offer their services as a joint enterprise in a bid to save people money. Indeed, the two companies are believed to have had meaningful dialog about offering said bundle at a cheaper price than subscribing to both streamers separately – a deal that would surely pique the interest of customers operating on a budget.  If the WSJ's report is correct – the outlet is keen to stress talks are still in the early stages – the potential bundling of Paramount Plus and Apple TV Plus into a single package could have a big impact on the wider streaming industry. For one, the world's eight biggest streamers have all raised their prices over the past 12 months – some, such as Disney Plus and Max, have done so twice in less than a year in the US. That's placed undue pressure on people who are subscribed to multiple services, with many forced to choose which one (or, at a push two) to stay with as the cost of living continues to bite.  The bundling of Paramount and Apple's platforms, then, would be seen as a significant move. Like their rivals, the pair have increased their subscription fees in 2023 – Apple TV Plus' major price hike was particularly irksome to me – and, while each one has some great content to offer customers, their back catalogs aren't on a par with Netflix, Prime Video, or even Hulu. Apple TV Plus' library only consists of first-party (albeit mostly terrific) offerings, while Paramount Plus doesn't have the strength in depth from first and third-party perspectives to compete with the world's most popular services.";"416";"2023-12-01T19:01:48"

"Apple's AI strategy or challenge";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b89swm/apples_ai_strategy_or_challenge/";"Apple´s stock has been tanking from day to day and there seems to be no end of the tunnel.   Some say $160, some say $120, UBS says it may be possible to see Apple being valued below $2 trillion.  &#x200B:  Let´s find out what Apple has:  1) Apple has the vertical integration by making their chip, their LLMs, their hardware, their SW (iOS).  2) Apple has their own generative LLM (Ajax) for training and inference (Generative AI)  3) Apple has their own image LLM (Ferret).  4) Apple does not use Nvidia´s chip for training.  5) Apple wants to have their AI play on device (edge computing).   &#x200B:  MSFT, GOOGL, OpenAI made their clear decision for Cloud AI with their LLM.  Apple goes another direction On Device AI. Hereby, Apple has two options if Apple wants to go with ML or LLM for their On Device AI.   &#x200B:  Their phones already have neural processors in their chips to assist with Edge inference and theres a bit of research coming out from them here and there, so they're aware and keeping an eye on it. Every few months the field makes strides in local LLM computing, by the time they're ready I think they'll be able to train a polished efficient small model that can help Siri be more intelligent and execute on more user requests, photo+video editing, and to manage their calenders and tasks better.  &#x200B:  As opposed to GOOGL, MSFT, OpenAI, Meta, Apple has blatant the last 20 years gathering as much data as they can from their customers, right on their hardware.      Giving everybody their own personal AI that runs directly on their phone, and you can interact with as seamlessly as possible, will put them back in the race.      ChatGPT doesn’t know how to advise you on information that it doesn’t have, which likely includes a lot of personal information like health, relationships, aspirations and goals, etc.      Apple has all of that info, so the AI that they create could actually do that.  &#x200B:  What is the major challenge for Apple?  Well... It is not easy to realize their On Device AI. Their LLM AJAX has way less parameters than ChatGPT 4.   Therefore, do not expect SIRI to get as smart as ChatGPT4.   Apple relies heavily on their privacy, which has paid off for loyal customers, but the privacy can give a limited support for generating and gathering data in contrast to Open Source.   Let´s see how Apple overcomes this challenge and if Apple can provide a valuable service for On Device AI (also offline mode) based on user´s personal data.   &#x200B:  Where Apple is way ahead is their image recognition with their LLM Ferret.   &#x200B:  Personally, I don´t expect too much what´s coming to WWDC.   AAPL seems to be in hurry if we received the message that all AppleCar´s groups are moving to AI.   &#x200B:";"107";"2024-03-06T21:09:24"
"Apple stock analysis and valuation - Why Warren Buffett loves it";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14in5od/apple_stock_analysis_and_valuation_why_warren/";"This week’s casual valuation is Apple. I hope you enjoy these posts and feel free to add your take.  *Disclaimer: I do not own shares in Apple.*  &#x200B:  The post is divided into the following sections:  •	Introduction  •	Historical financial performance  •	The balance sheet  •	Assumptions and valuation  •	Valuation based on different assumptions (and discount rate)  &#x200B:  **Introduction**  Apple is the largest public company with a market cap of almost $3 trillion. We can go look back at its history and admire its outstanding performance, but even if we take a look at the last 5 years, its share price is up over 300%! For comparison, S&P500 is up 60% over the same period.  My one-sentence summary of Apple would be – **A technology company with strong brand and pricing power.**  At the end of March 2023, Apple was 46% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio.  Since Q1/2016 until today, Berkshire has bought over a billion shares in Apple at an average price of $39.65, leading to a total cost of almost $42 billion. Out of all the shares bought, 123 million have been sold for $12.5 billion, and the remaining 916 million shares have a market value of $171 billion. This leads to a return of 346%, excluding dividends.  &#x200B:  **Historical financial performance**  Since 2017, Apple provides a split of its revenue into:  &#x200B:  * Products (iPhone, iPad, AirPods, Mac, Apple TV, Apple Watch, etc.) * Services (Advertising, Cloud, Digital content, App store fees, Payment services, etc.)  Why is this relevant? Well, services naturally have higher margins.  If we take a look at the data related to this split, we'll see that the % of revenue generated from services increased from 14% back in 2017, to 21% today.  This is an important piece of the valuation puzzle. The assumptions regarding future profitability depend on the assumptions about how this will develop in the future. If the trend continues and services increase as % of revenue, then **higher profitability should be expected**. If the trend reverses, then **lower profitability should be expected.**  Many analysts point to iPhone as the biggest risk. Back in 2017, iPhone sales were responsible for 62% of all of Apple's revenue. Over the last twelve months, that % is down to 52%. It is still significant and it should not be ignored. If Apple disappoints with the next iPhone model, it will have a significant impact on its profitability, and valuation. It can also be argued that the new models aren't significantly better than the previous ones and come with slight design changes and limited additional features. However, as long as the customers are willing to pay for them, well, that's what matters.  &#x200B:  Let's take a look at the financials and how they've changed over the last 5 years.  The gross profit increased from 38% in 2019 to 43% for the last twelve months (ending April 1st, 2023). Based on the development of the mix between products/services, this doesn't come as a surprise.  The operating expenses (Research & Development, and Selling, General & Administrative) have been incredibly stable, between 13-14% (combined) of revenue. Many investors love predictability, and Apple definitely delivers that.  All of the above translates to an increase in the operating margin from 25% back in 2019 to 29% over the last twelve months.  With revenue of $385 billion, Apple is generating over $100 billion in operating profit per year.  More importantly, during this period, there were two events that impacted most of the companies:  **The pandemic (Covid-19)** and **high inflation.**  We cannot see any negative impact coming from these events on Apple's financials. It continued to perform exceptionally even through uncertain and difficult times. The increased costs (due to raw materials, but also higher employee salaries) were successfully passed on to the final customers.  It doesn't come as a surprise that Warren Buffett loves it. What is there not to love?  &#x200B:  **The balance sheet**  So, what happens with all of the excess cash that is consistently being generated? It is being returned back to the shareholders, via share buybacks and dividends.  Over the last decade, Apple reduced the # of outstanding shares by a third. In addition, its annual dividend payment is over $14 billion per year.  The decision to return cash back to the shareholders is basically the management admitting that they don't have projects to invest in, that will yield acceptable returns. Whether buybacks are the way to go at today's share price, is another question.  If we take a look at the balance sheet, the company has $180 billion of cash, short and long-term investments. Although this might sound impressive, this is roughly 5% of their market cap.  On the other side of the balance sheet, there's $110 billion in debt (including leases).  &#x200B:  **Assumptions and valuation**  Here are my assumptions for the future:  **Revenue growth:** 7% per year over the next 3 years, then declining over time to 4%. With this assumption, revenue in 10 years' time increases by 71%  **Operating margin:** 29%, increasing to 32% over the next decade (I expect services to increase as % of revenue, leading to higher margins)  **Discount rate:** 11% discounting to 8.7% over time  &#x200B:  After adjusting for what is on their balance sheet, as well as the equity options outstanding, the value of Apple is roughly **$2 trillion ($127.24/share).**  For comparison, today’s market cap is 2.94 trillion ($186.68/share).  &#x200B:  **Valuation based on assumptions different than mine**  The future is uncertain and my assumptions could be significantly wrong. Let's take a look at how the valuation (per share) changes if we use different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now as well as the operating margin.  &#x200B:  |Revenue / Operating margin|28%|30%|32%|34%|CAGR| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |50% ($578b)|$101.9|$108.7|$113.9|$119.6|4.1%| |71% ($657b)|$113.7|$121.4|$127.2|$133.8|5.5%| |100% ($770b)|$128.5|$137.3|$144.2|$151.8|7.2%| |160% ($999b)|$155.0|$169.1|$177.9|$187.6|10.0%|  For Apple to be fairly valued, it needs to grow its revenue at 10% annually over the next decade and increase its operating margin from its current 29% to 34%.  At the moment, the market is paying a significant premium for Apple and there is positive sentiment around the company.  Overall, I do like the company, and I can see myself buying shares at a reasonable price. It is quite clear that Buffett got a great deal by buying shares at an average price of $39.65.  &#x200B:  As always, thank you for reading the post and for all the support.";"350";"2023-06-25T16:06:46"

"Apple iPhone maker Foxconn being investigated in China as founder runs for Taiwan presidency";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17elbup/apple_iphone_maker_foxconn_being_investigated_in/";"https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/economy/china-foxconn-investigation-taiwan-presidency-intl-hnk/index.html   Taiwan’s Foxconn, one of Apple’s largest suppliers, is being investigated by authorities in China, according to state media. The probe comes weeks after founder Terry Gou announced his bid for Taiwan’s presidency and stressed that he won’t be pressured by Beijing, despite his extensive business operations in the country. While it is unclear whether the investigations are connected to Gou’s entrance into the presidential race, analysts said the move will send jitters through foreign businesses in China. On Sunday, the state-owned Global Times reported that tax authorities had recently audited Foxconn’s key subsidiaries in the provinces of Guangdong and Jiangsu, where it has major factories. The natural resources ministry had also investigated the company’s use of land in Henan and Hubei provinces, it reported, citing anonymous sources. Foxconn said in statement sent to CNN that complying with the law was one of its “basic principles.” “We will actively cooperate with the relevant units on the related work and operations,” it added. Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, has iPhone factories in Guangdong and Henan, including the world’s largest in the city of Zhengzhou.  The company’s listed unit in Shanghai, Foxconn Industrial Internet, plummeted by its daily limit of 10% on Monday. Parent firm Foxconn Technology, which is listed in Taipei, fell more than 2%. The probe was revealed after Chinese police reportedly raided the Shanghai office of international advertising agency GroupM, owned by WPP, as Beijing ratcheted up pressure on foreign businesses. Foxconn is one of the world’s largest contract manufacturers. It makes everything from smartphones to electrical vehicles for clients including Apple, but doesn’t sell anything under its own brand. It began operating in China in 1988 and is one of the largest private employers in the country.";"508";"2023-10-23T16:10:56"

As long-time Apple investors, we've enjoyed the highs of groundbreaking releases, but is it time for a reality check? Is AAPL overpriced, or are we merely on the cusp of another wave of innovation that will take the stock to new heights?  ## Mild Reception for iPhone 15  Even the most avid iPhone users appear somewhat unimpressed with the latest features. The question that looms is whether Apple has reached a plateau in terms of smartphone innovation. After all, how much better can a phone camera get? Is faster processing power enough to justify upgrading?  ## AAPL Stock in Rough Waters  The stock has been wobbly, and many are wondering if a market correction is overdue. The high valuation of AAPL stock might seem unwarranted based on current product releases. So, should investors cut and run or stick around for the next big thing?  ## Hidden Potential: Siri and LLm  While it's easy to focus on tangible products, let's not forget Apple's potential in software and services. Rumors of significant Siri improvements and the much-talked-about LLm feature could turn the tide for the tech giant. We've seen how software services like Apple Music and the App Store have become significant revenue streams: could a next-gen Siri do the same?  ## Never Rule Out Innovation  Apple has always been a frontrunner in technology. Whether it's introducing the first iPhone or changing the way we listen to music with the iPod, Apple has continually set new industry standards. As investors, perhaps what we need is not skepticism but patience.   So, to my tech industry peers and fellow Apple stockholders, I'm eager to hear your thoughts.

Generally I'm a big user of Apple products but they have definitely been getting expensive recently largely from Apple's push in vertical integration of semiconductors. Each generation of M series chip has lasted 1-2 years making the rate at which Apple is improving astonishing but also means their costs are rising quickly.  It's common knowledge that semiconductors get more expensive to manufacture as their architectural complexity increases. This is understood as the cost of being at the bleeding edge of the industry and is representative through many avenues including R&D. Exact numbers are difficult to grasp because  Apple has been constantly in a state of new chip development for the past 3-4 years. With the trend that generally people will be buying ""big ticket"" electronics like laptops and phones with less frequency moving forward, there will be a point where it is no longer viable for Apple to improve its semiconductor or has to find more sales.

The iPhone maker has attracted at least 36 specialists from its rival since it hired John Giannandrea to be its top AI executive in 2018.  Apple has also created a secretive European laboratory in Zurich. Professor Luc Van Gool from Swiss university ETH Zurich said Apple’s acquisitions of two local AI start-ups — virtual reality group FaceShift and image recognition company Fashwell — led Apple to build a research laboratory, known as its “Vision Lab”, in the city.  Industry insiders suggest Apple is focused on deploying generative AI on its mobile devices, a breakthrough that would allow AI chatbots and apps to run on the phone’s own hardware and software rather than be powered by cloud services in data centres.  Apple’s top AI team is now made up of former key figures from Google, including Giannandrea, who previously oversaw Google Brain, the search company’s AI lab which has since been merged DeepMind.  Samy Bengio, senior director of AI and ML research, was formerly one of Google’s top AI scientists. Ruoming Pang, who leads Apple’s “Foundation Models” team working on large language models, previously led Google’s AI speech recognition research.

Dell Technologies Inc. DELL, +8.56% was a hot company around the turn of the century, as it leapt ahead in the fast-moving race to sell personal computers. The company became the top-selling computer-systems provider globally in 2001.  The brand lost some of its cachet as the years went on, and as Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.48% began to see more traction in the personal-computer market. But Dell seems cool again in the artificial-intelligence era, and investors are taking notice.  The stock closed up 8.6% in Wednesday trading to hit $128.58. That marked a new all-time closing high for the shares, their first in about a month.  Read: Apple’s stock has faltered, but a Steve Jobs moment in AI may be on the horizon  Dell’s stock has enjoyed an explosive recent run, rising 67% so far in 2024 and advancing 214% over the past year. And its performance over a longer span as been notable as well, especially on a relative basis: Dell shares are up 309% over a five-year period, while Apple’s stock is ahead 245%.  Wall Street has a new appreciation for Dell thanks to the company’s position as a backbone of the AI revolution. The shares enjoyed their best day on record in early March, as the company showed rapid shipment growth for its AI-optimized servers. AI-hardware titan Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.55% even gave Dell a prominent shoutout at its recent GTC developer event.  “While the company has been through prior technology cycles (server virtualization, public cloud, mobile, etc.), one key difference for AI is that it appears to be incremental” to the total addressable market, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a mid-March note to clients. Earlier shifts in the tech landscape meant that newer technologies displaced legacy ones to an extent, he added.  https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dells-stock-is-at-a-new-highand-it-has-beaten-apples-over-a-five-year-span-acbbf304?mod=home-page";"113";"2024-04-04T03:02:49"

Led by John Giannandrea, the company's Head of AI, these units aim to develop advanced models to compete with leading AI technologies by OpenAI and Google. The ""Foundational Models"" team, with about 16 members, is working to enhance Siri and explore AI language models. Other teams focus on visual intelligence and multimodal AI, covering image, video, and text generation. One application under development is an AppleCare chatbot. Apple's internal language model, known as Ajax GPT, is touted to surpass OpenAI's GPT-3.5, having been trained on over 200 billion parameters. CEO Tim Cook emphasizes that Apple's primary aim is not to be first, but to be the best, aligning with his business philosophy.      However, Apple faces challenges as rumors circulate that China has banned government officials from using iPhones, affecting the company’s stock prices. China is a critical market and manufacturing hub for Apple, contributing nearly one-fifth of its revenue.

"India could account for 20% of Apple’s user growth over the next five years";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1521a34/india_could_account_for_20_of_apples_user_growth/";"India will likely be a major driver of Apple’s five-year revenue and installed base growth, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note Monday, citing Apple’s investment in manufacturing in India and the country’s “economic boom.”  The note also reflected a new India-driven price target increase, from $190 to $220, with a bull-case valuation increased to $270. Morgan Stanley also reiterated Apple as their Top Pick.  Morgan Stanley analysts forecast that over the next five years, the country could account for 15% of Apple’s revenue growth — in contrast to 2% in the past five years and $6 billion today — and 20% of the company’s installed base growth.  The revenue growth, which Morgan Stanley forecasts at $40 billion over the next 10 years, would be the “equivalent to Apple ramping an entirely new product category.”  The analysts cite a number of factors in their assessment, including India’s improved electrification and Apple’s clear efforts to build a manufacturing and retail presence in the country. A survey commissioned by Morgan Stanley suggested Indian consumers have an increased desire and ability to purchase iPhones.  Analysts did add a caveat, warning that if India fails to meet its economic and demographic growth marks, “we wouldn’t expect Apple to be as significant of a beneficiary in India.”  But Morgan Stanley’s fundamental thesis is bullish. “All-in, this means that India will be just as important to Apple’s growth algorithm over the next 5+ years as China was in the last 5 years, something we believe the market underappreciates today,” the analysts said.  https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/17/india-will-account-for-20percent-of-apples-user-growth-over-the-next-five-years-morgan-stanley-.html";"150";"2023-07-17T14:59:06"

I feel like it's a matter of holding on to key business to not lose to a competitor but as far as growth there is no more. So would that equate to the share prices hovering or slightly increasing? Like in the 90s apple had a small market with their desktops then in the early 2000s started ipods laptops then the iPhone there was so much of a market to expand upon and so much money to be made. Now everyone has an iPhone and MacBook its about keeping that consumer trend going.   So if I want to make the most out of investments I need to find companies that are like apple in early 2000s. Or can I put money in these giant companies and still see a lot of growth?

"Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven' (apple, meta, google, Microsoft, Tesla..)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14w58g3/nasdaq_100_plans_special_rebalance_to_curb/";"From https://www.investors.com/news/nasdaq-100-plans-special-rebalance-to-curb-dominance-of-magnificent-seven/    The Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the ""magnificent seven"" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.  The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.  The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to ""address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights.""  The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.  The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.   How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted? The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.  The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.  The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.  Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.  Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.  Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.  Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.  Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.  How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut? Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.  Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.  The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.  Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023 The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.  This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.  There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.  Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices? The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.  However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&P 500, which is why S&P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.  The S&P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.  Most of the ""magnificent 7"" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.  The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.  Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.";"108";"2023-07-10T22:25:37"
"iPhone sales slow down: Apple to see sharpest fall in revenue since 2016 as analysts stress on AI to boost growth";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15fv0st/iphone_sales_slow_down_apple_to_see_sharpest_fall/";"Apple is expected to witness a decline in iPhone sales during the April-June quarter, attributed to cautious consumer behaviour in a slow economy as the launch of a new model is anticipated. As the tech giant prepares to release its earnings report, analysts emphasise the significance of revealing its utilisation of artificial intelligence (AI) to boost growth.  Apple, the world's most valuable company, is projected to experience a 1.6% dip in total quarterly revenue, which would mark its sharpest decrease in third-quarter revenue since 2016, according to Refinitiv. Specifically, iPhone sales are anticipated to have declined by over 2% during this period, based on a survey of 24 analysts conducted by Visible Alpha. This contrasts with a nearly 3% increase in sales during the same quarter last year and a 1.5% rise in the preceding quarter (January-March).  The upcoming quarterly report may serve as a deviation from the positive earnings trend observed in other prominent tech companies such as Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Microsoft. These companies have demonstrated resilience in their cloud-based operations and have witnessed a surge in digital ad sales. ""Apple is not immune to general macroeconomic trends and will continue to set the pace (for the smartphone industry) for quite some time,"" Reuters quoted Bob O'Donnell, founder of TECHnalysis Research, as saying. In September, analysts anticipate the unveiling of the much-anticipated iPhone 15, which could feature the widely accepted USB-C port on certain models. This development may provide a slight boost to iPhone sales during the July-September quarter, according to market experts, who have differing opinions on the overall performance during this period.  Notably, Apple has a tradition of not providing quarterly outlooks. However, industry analysts speculate that the tech giant might shed light on its utilisation of AI to enhance the upcoming product lineup, offering insights into the company's innovative approach.";"122";"2023-08-02T03:27:57"

But tests late last year found the chip was **too slow and prone to overheating.** Its circuit board was so big it would **take up half an iPhone, making it unusable.**   Investors had counted on Apple saving money with an in-house chip to help compensate for weak demand in the larger smartphone market. Apple—which hasn’t publicly acknowledged its modem project, much less its shortcomings—is estimated to have **paid more than $7.2 billion to Qualcomm last year for the chips.**   Engineering teams working on Apple’s modem chip have been slowed by **technical challenges, poor communication and managers split** over the wisdom of trying to design the chips rather than buy them, these people said.

This is likely happening in connection with the recent WWDC 2023, where promising products such as Vision Pro were introduced. However, the hot news of this AR/VR headset is not what drives up the company's stock price. Mark Gurman offers a different explanation.     **Why Are Investors Not Showing Interest In Vision Pro?**   [**Apple**](https://afronomist.com/?s=Apple) touched the $3 trillion mark at the beginning of 2022. Now it is approaching it again, and ***Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman***, who has long focused on [Apple’s business strategy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-06-30/apple-s-aapl-near-3-trillion-valuation-isn-t-about-the-vision-pro-headset), provides an analysis that reveals the reasons behind this trend. At first glance, it may seem that investors believe in the revolutionary Vision Pro headset, but the opposite is true.   AR/VR glasses like Vision Pro will not become as popular as iPhones or MacBooks when they are launched. The high price, impractical external battery, and the still unclear practical use of this headset will be the cause. Apple is aware of this, as are the investors who rely on other products.  **What Drives The Increase In Stock Prices?**   As the first reason, Gurman mentions Apple’s user interface. The integration of all mobile devices, tablets, watches, and the availability of music and video subscriptions on every product is extremely convenient, making it hard to leave this ecosystem. In the case of Apple, customers are simply willing to pay extra for the luxury that the brand offers.   Another aspect is the fact that a new series of iPhones, the [**iPhone 15**](https://afronomist.com/what-are-the-side-buttons-on-the-new-iphone-15-pro-like/), will be released in the fall, bringing more significant changes and new features after a while.

While I think the underlying business of Google is incredibly good, I have the feeling that it moat is getting smaller. I expect growth from its cloud services, YouTube, and maybe some of Google bets might play out (Pixel phones, robotaxies, chromebooks if they stop sucking...) , but we all know that the most profitable part of Google business is its search engine.  Know, while Microsoft might try to eat Googles pie and is probably its main competitor over most segments, especially Bing/Chatgpt vs Chrome/Bard, Outlook vs Gmail, M.Teams vs G.meet and so on, I think the biggest treat is actually Apple.  Right know Google is paying a big undisclosed amount (probably around 20 bln $ a year ) to be the default search engine on Apple devices, where a lot of Google searches (from the most valuable well off users) come from. The idea that Apple could raise the price of the deal by a lot or start promoting its own search engine is quite terrifing. It would be a risky move for them (losing 10s of blns a year for doing effectively nothing, and coming up with a search engine on their own that gives satisfactory results) but given Apples pivot toward services and its insane customer loyalty it might not be that crazy after all.  Android has a biggest market share, but these people have a lower capacity/willingness to spend, so it doesn't really matters that much. If I had to rate Google search traffic, I would say that the one coming from Android users is the safest (and probably the least profitable), the one coming from Windows PC is still relatively safe (despite bing being default and intagrated with Chatgpt), and the one coming from iOS is the one most at risk, and unfortunately for Google the most profitable.

"Meta's Reality Labs posts $3.85 billion loss in first quarter";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cchrf6/metas_reality_labs_posts_385_billion_loss_in/";"Meta shows no signs of substantially trimming its losses from investing in the metaverse, as competition heightens between the Facebook parent and Apple in the virtual reality market.  In its first-quarter earnings report Wednesday, Meta disclosed that its Reality Labs unit recorded a $3.85 billion operating loss. Revenue in the metaverse division was $440 million, up about 30% from $339 million a year ago and representing only around 1% of Meta’s total sales for the quarter.  Analysts were expecting a $4.31 billion operating loss and sales of $512.5 million for the quarter, according to StreetAccount.  Reality Labs has now lost more than $45 billion since the end of 2020, when Meta first began reporting the business segment separately.  Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called the metaverse “the next frontier,” imagining a digital world that facilitates both productivity and recreation. He changed the name of his company from Facebook to Meta in 2021 to reflect his vision for the future of computing.  For now, developing metaverse technology remains a fledgling and costly effort.  The company unveiled in September the Quest 3 VR headset, the latest version of its mixed reality hardware, with a starting price of $499. Apple started selling its $3,499 Vision Pro in February, touting a so-called “spatial computing” experience.  Meta announced Monday that it will partner with third-party hardware companies to create new VR headsets using the same Meta Horizon operating system that powers its Quest headsets. Zuckerberg said that while Apple “basically won out” in the phone market with its closed ecosystem, Meta’s move aims to ensure the “open model defines the next generation of computing.”  Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/24/metas-reality-labs-posts-3point85-billion-loss-in-first-quarter.html";"927";"2024-04-25T05:18:51"
"AAPL stock continues climb to $3T with new trading highs";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14guw7p/aapl_stock_continues_climb_to_3t_with_new_trading/";"Apple stock (AAPL) recently bucked a year-long trend and set a new record-high closing price. Ten days later, investors are looking at a new intraday trading high as well as the highest closing price to date.      The company closed at $187.00 per share today after opening at $183.74 and reaching $187.04 during trading. That puts Apple at a $2.941 trillion valuation based on market cap.      Apple nearly became the first company to close with a $3 trillion company valuation in January 2022, but the peak high didn’t last through intraday trading. Apple would go on to lose $1 trillion in value by year’s end due to iPhone supply constraints bottlenecking sales.      And while Apple stock saw the company’s valuation hit the $3 trillion mark last year, AAPL still hasn’t closed with a $3 trillion company valuation.      Despite significant setbacks at the end of last year, it continues to look likely that Apple will close with a $3 trillion valuation in the near future. Apple is once again positioned as the most valuable company on Wall Street, with a $2.94 trillion valuation.      In terms of products, Apple is planning four new iPhones with USB-C this fall. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are gaining the Dynamic Island design introduced with the iPhone 14 Pro. 9to5Mac also has in-depth reporting on the new iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. The latter iPhone is expected to be the first with a periscope-design lens system for enhanced optical zoom.      Apple Vision Pro, the company’s all-new AR/VR product, will hit stores in the United States in early 2024. The product carries a $3,499 price tag.

"Apple's mixed reality headset announcement sends Unity stock soaring";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/142bzin/apples_mixed_reality_headset_announcement_sends/";"Unity Software (U) stock soared on Monday, rising nearly 20% into the close after a shoutout during Apple's (AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference.      Unity's gaming software will be used in Apple's new mixed reality headset, the Apple Vision Pro, Apple announced on Monday.  ""We know there is a community of developers who have been building incredible 3D apps for years,"" Apple's vice president of worldwide developer relations said during the WWDC presentation. And today we are excited to share that we've been working with Unity to bring those apps to Vision Pro. So popular Unity-based games and apps can gain full access to vision OS features such as pass-through, high-resolution renderings, and native gestures.""      **Volume in Unity stock shot up to more than triple the 20-day moving average as the stock had its best intraday performance since November 10.**  Unity operates a cross-platform game engine that was first discussed at an Apple WWDC in 2005 in regard to the Mac. The company went public in 2020 and the stock was bought up to nearly $200 a share during the 2021 tech surge in stocks. Ark Innovation Founder Cathie Wood is a shareholder. Unity is the 15th largest holding in Ark's flagship fund, the Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) and represents 3.46% of the total portfolio.     On May 10, Unity reported first-quarter earnings that beat Street estimates for revenue while posting a wider-than-expected loss per share. **Unity reported first-quarter revenue of $500.36 million compared to Wall Street estimates of $477.67**. Unity's adjusted earnings per share loss of $0.09 was more than $0.01 the Street had been expecting.      Like others in the gaming sector, Unity spent its first-quarter earnings call positioning itself as an AI winner.      ""AI is going to have a profound effect on the industry,"" Unity CEO John S. Riccitiello said on the company's earnings call. ""First, it's going to lead to inflection up in growth as game types are built that were no longer — were not previously possible. And secondly, we're going to see, I believe, some of the crazy expense that goes on in some high-end production come down some. It's a favorable part of the game industry for growth. And I guess it'd be very favorable for Unity as we drive some of these changes through the industry.""";"33";"2023-06-06T12:48:35"

The anticipated $60 billion valuation will make it the largest IPO of 2023. Leading tech giants such as Nvidia, Intel, Samsung, and Apple are keen to acquire a few percent stake each in Arm, aiming for medium to long-term shareholder roles to ensure stock price stability at listing.      Since the abandonment of a $40 billion sale to Nvidia in 2020 due to regulatory concerns, SoftBank has been working on taking Arm public. The chipmaker's market valuation has doubled from the $31 billion SoftBank paid seven years ago. This significant IPO follows Technicolor's $97 billion deal in September 2022, marking a major milestone in the technology and finance sectors.      Arm's IPO stands as a pivotal event in the global semiconductor market, reflecting the company's critical role in the industry. Along with the imminent listing, other major financial moves are underway in the tech world, such as Alibaba's contemplation of a $29 billion listing of its IDCG e-commerce unit in the US, showcasing a dynamic and robust market landscape.";"36";"2023-08-08T15:37:44"

Several agencies have begun instructing staff not to bring their iPhones to work, people familiar with the matter said, affirming a previous report from the Wall Street Journal. In addition, **Beijing intends to extend that restriction far more broadly to a plethora of state-owned enterprises and other government-controlled organizations**, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter.  If Beijing goes ahead, **the unprecedented blockade will be the culmination of a yearslong effort to root out foreign technology use** in sensitive environments, coinciding with Beijing’s effort to reduce its reliance on American software and circuitry. It **threatens to erode Apple’s position in a market that yields about a fifth of its revenue**, and from where it makes the majority of the world’s iPhones through sprawling factories that employ millions of Chinese.  Chinese state firms like oil giant PetroChina Co. employ millions and control vast swathes of a centrally planned economy. Given Apple’s relationship with Beijing and its importance to the economy, it “has historically been viewed as relatively safe in China from government restrictions,” KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel said in a report Wednesday. “Is the government changing its stance?”  A representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.

"Epic Games wins antitrust lawsuit against Google";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18g9t8e/epic_games_wins_antitrust_lawsuit_against_google/";" SAN FRANCISCO — Epic Games won an antitrust lawsuit against Google on Monday, in a landmark decision where a jury found Google broke competition laws in how it ran its app store.  The decision is a major blow to the tech giant and the concept that Big Tech companies should have complete control over how pricing and payments are done on their massive internet platforms. It could open up other challenges to how large tech companies govern their marketplaces, potentially forcing them to allow alternate payment processors. That could cut into revenue for Google and other companies like Apple and Amazon, which make money by charging fees on any transactions on their platforms.  In summer 2020, Epic had revolted against Apple and Google’s payment-sharing systems for app developers. Epic tweaked its popular Fortnite app so users could pay the company directly. First Apple, then Google, booted Fortnite from their app stores for violating terms. Epic sued both companies, arguing the rules violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/11/epic-google-trial-verdict/";"938";"2023-12-12T02:13:50"

I just want to learn.   Everybody also thinks this is an attack on Tesla and Musk. It is **not**. I want to know if this is the way that the market works or not.  Why do I care? Because Tesla is relatively a gigantic company. Why did I ask about if the same would happen with Apple? Because Apple is also a relatively gigantic company.

In the video he has to brake the car himself when it almost runs a red light (at around 19:45). It also received a decent amount of news coverage.

Or is it basically all just about the money that the company brings in?  ——   Thanks to everybody who answered nicely. I’ve gotten some explanations that make sense including:  - Elon’s livestream video wasn’t of current autopilot software on Teslas, but rather a beta FSD which performed very well.  - 44 million people probably didn’t actually see that moment where “human intervention” takes place. Plus the media blew it out of proportion.  - Computer trading algorithms don’t care about these minute things.  - This isn’t exclusive to Tesla. Similar things like this happening to other gigantic companies happen and they barely matter.  - The market overall went up on the 29th and Tesla has a high beta.

Apple stock decisively confirmed its breakout to new record highs on Friday, and that could pave the way for more upside into 2024, according to a Friday note from Fairlead Strategies.  The firm highlighted that with Apple stock trading at $187 Friday afternoon, the stock is poised to close above its prior resistance level of $183 for the second week in a row, confirming a decisive breakout.  This ""bullish long-term development"" generates a new price objective of $254 per share for Apple, representing potential upside of 37% from current levels. A rise to that level would give the iPhone maker a market valuation of about $4 trillion based on today's current shares outstanding of 15.79 billion.  ""The breakout yields a measured move objective of about $254 using the Covid/2020 corrective low as a point of reference,"" Fairlead Strategies' founder Katie Stockton told Insider on Friday. ""The 'measured move' assumes that the uptrend that preceded the 2021-2022 trading range has resumed.""  Stockton identified the end of 2024 as the timeframe for the technical price objective to be reached, and noted that the stock's uptrend looks poised to continue in the short term.  ""The uptrend shows no counter-trend signals yet. When a pullback develops, initial support is at the rising 20-day moving average... although a pullback does not appear imminent,"" she said. The 20-day moving average for Apple stock is currently around $181 per share.  Apple stock has surged 44% so far in 2023 and has driven the bulk of the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of about 14%. The company recently announced its first product in the AR/VR market, the Apple Vision headset, which will sell for $3,499 when it is released early next year.

"Why Warren Buffett is not selling AAPL (anymore) + Some risks for AAPL";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bdpl2w/why_warren_buffett_is_not_selling_aapl_anymore/";"There are some rumors and speculations that Warren Buffett tends to keep selling AAPL due to their recent pullbacks and potential risks faced by the EU, DOJ, and China.  &#x200B:  However, my view is different: Warren Buffett has been an excellent investor and probably, he is the greatest investor of all time with his long lasting track record.   He is not a 100m sprinter, but a relentless marathon runner. It says his long term strategy.  As his core business is insurance, I am pretty sure that Warren Buffett though about all these potential risks before his decision to invest in AAPL.   That´s how an insurance company works by analyzing all possible and potential risks (  &#x200B:  The another argument why he is not selling is: He can´t sell (if he would like to..)  **He can't sell because a very high percentage of his capital tied down in Apple consists of embedded capital gains, over 80% at present market prices, meaning that if he sold, the IRS would take a huge chunk of Berkshire's capital in taxes.**  The future will be like Coca Cola or American Express.   But as I said: He does not want to sell in real, because all potential risks facing now were considered by his own ""due dilligence"" before investing in Apple.   &#x200B:  And you know: Warren Buffett HATES paying taxes.   Apple´s narrative is still there. The fundamentals are strong and solid.   &#x200B:  However, Apple also brings some risks with their recent strategy:  &#x200B:  1. Apple plans to launch ads on TV+ 2. Apple plans to launch AI-driven ads on App Store. 3. Not sure what Apple will launch at WWDC.  &#x200B:  Their ad business is critical, because it is a contradiction of what Apple appeals for consumer´s privacy.   Ad means tracking users.   &#x200B:  But Apple may lose $20 billion contract which has been paid by Google for their search on iOS if Google loses the antitrust case.   Apple also needs to allow all developers + consumers to sideload on App Store in the EU.   &#x200B:  Apple must cover all these potential losses by bringing ads on TV+ and App Store.   But Apple may face a lot of sensitive consumers and loyal consumers due to a potential privacy issue.   &#x200B:  It is clear: Apple becomes less attractive than before.  &#x200B:  AI is a ""buzzword"" and how AI will increase the productivity (if the productivity is given, what % increase of the productivity???), nobody knows.  But the market seems to bet on a 100% or 200% productivity increase driven by AI, which may end with a carnage and huge disappointment.   &#x200B:  But Apple needs to deliver ""WOW""-effects at WWDC. Otherwise, the market will punish Apple again.  Apple needs to come up with fresh new ideas, which have never been introduced by Samsung or Google before.   At least, Tim Cook calls the upcoming AI event ""incredible breakthrough"".   &#x200B:";"64";"2024-03-13T12:53:20"

One of the **selling features** is that your eyes are visible, but the headset will conceal your eyes when you're fully immersed in an app.. which may or may not be groundbreaking as it didn't perfectly reveal your eyes (perhaps because there wasn't enough lighting inside the goggles to show your eyes clearly, but I think this could be fixed w/ software or by adding LED lights on the inside edges), however:  * If you can keep your headset on while talking to people in the room compared to the competition, this feature alone would win out  Price tag is $3500, but again this is the dev conference, so the consumer version of this product will come later, although I can see how a lot of developers might want to buy this thing (also consider that Apple has the largest developer network) compared to competitor headsets which cost 7x less (META is coming out with a $500 VR headset).  Something to note, the stock dropped nearly 1.5% during all the free features (before the VR headset) that were going to be included to existing users, however that did coincide with the market indexes dropping as well.  Total drop from the peak was around 3.5% however the stock recovered nearly a percent, today's loss is only around 0.75% after falling from making another new 52w all time high.  Trading volume was 2x the normal average, so ending red is very significant.  META & MSFT stayed relatively flat compared to AAPL.  Overall I think this was bad news for the stock in the short term: buy the rumor sell the news type event.  If the VR headset was truly revolutionary, stock price would have gone much higher, **so we have to wait & see what Apple developers can do with this headset for consumers & what Apple's actual consumer version of the headset will be.**  Than after 12 to 18 months when the killer apps come out, re-evaluate Apple's VR headset.

That was the essence of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s testimony in federal court on Monday as part of the government’s antitrust trial against Google. Nadella told the court that Google’s dominant market share in online search means that publishers and advertisers shape their content to Google’s requirements, making it harder for competitors like Microsoft’s Bing to gain a foothold.  “Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web,” Nadella said from the stand in Washington, D.C., District Court. Nadella was referring to the way publishers often cater their content and advertising to Google’s products, like by optimizing their pages for how Google ranks search results. Nadella was questioned by lawyers for the Department of Justice and a coalition of state attorneys general who are suing Google for allegedly violating antitrust laws by illegally maintaining a monopoly in the general search market. The government argues that Google locked up distribution channels for general search engines through exclusive deals with browser and phone makers to be the default choice on various devices. Perhaps the most famous of those deals is the multibillion-dollar agreement between Google and Apple to make Google search the default on Apple products like the iPhone.  The government has tried to make the case that Google’s dominance, aided by these exclusive deals, creates a flywheel effect, where greater exposure to users leads to more data to make Google’s search results better and attracts more advertisers to the product. That, in turn, generates more revenue that can be used to fund these massive distribution deals. Meanwhile, the government argues, it becomes even harder for rivals to breakthrough to consumers, and as a result, they miss out on the opportunity for greater benefits or innovations in search. Nadella affirmed that argument in his testimony Monday, describing the obstacles a general search competitor like Bing faces to gain more market share from Google.";"763";"2023-10-03T01:59:21"
"Arm shares spike 24% after chip designer gives strong forecast, says AI is increasing sales";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1alek9u/arm_shares_spike_24_after_chip_designer_gives/";"Arm reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat estimates and gave a strong profit forecast for the current quarter. The shares soared more than 20% in extended trading.  Here’s how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending December:  Revenue: $824 million, vs. $761 million expected  EPS: 29 cents adjusted, vs 25 cents expected.   Arm, whose chip design technology is in nearly every smartphone and many PCs, said it expects earnings per share for the fiscal fourth quarter of between 28 cents and 32 cents on sales of $850 million to $900 million. Analysts expectations earnings of 21 cents per share on sales of $780 million.  The company reported net income of $87 million, or 8 cents per share. Total revenue in the quarter increased 14% from a year earlier.  Arm makes money through royalties, when companies pay for access to build Arm-compatible chips, usually amounting to a small percentage of the final chip price.  Arm said its customers shipped 7.7 billion Arm chips during the September quarter, which is the most recent period which figures are available.  Royalty revenue increased 11% on an annual basis to $470 million. The company said the jump was partially because of a recovery in the smartphone market, as well as increasing sales to automotive companies and cloud providers. Arm said that it expects growth to be driven by royalty revenue.  In recent years, Arm has emphasized its licensing business, selling access to more complete designs that semiconductor companies can take and plug into their planned chips. That process saves chipmakers time and effort, and it’s more lucrative for Arm than simply collecting royalties.  Arm’s license and other revenue was $354 million, up 18% year-over-year. Arm said more companies were choosing to license its CPU designs to run artificial intelligence, and that the company charges higher licensing fees for advanced designs.  Arm, which had been owned by SoftBank, went public in September. The company was founded in 1990 to develop technology for low-power chips, but became more important to the overall technology industry when the Apple  iPhone and competing Android devices standardized on Arm-based chips.  Arm says that companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia use its technology.  Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/07/arm-earnings-report-q3-2024-.html";"603";"2024-02-07T22:43:28"

"Nvidia passes Alphabet in market cap, now the third most valuable U.S. company";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ar26eu/nvidia_passes_alphabet_in_market_cap_now_the/";"Nvidia surpassed Google parent Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday. It’s the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmaker’s stock soaring.  Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Google’s $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.  The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.  Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.  Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques — such as transformer architecture — used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.  Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a “code red” situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.  Nvidia is now the third largest U.S. company, only behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 21. Analysts expect 118% annual growth in sales to $59.04 billion.

"Tesla execs Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel depart as company announces layoffs";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1c4wan2/tesla_execs_drew_baglino_and_rohan_patel_depart/";"Tesla executives Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel announced Monday they are leaving the electric vehicle maker and clean energy company. CEO Elon Musk thanked both departing execs on X, the social network he owns and runs as chief technology officer.  The news comes after Tesla said it is laying off more than 10% of its workforce.  Baglino had worked with Tesla since its early years, starting as a firmware and electrical engineer in 2006. He most recently reported directly to Musk as the company’s senior vice president for powertrain and energy engineering.  Patel joined Tesla in 2016 after working as a senior advisor to former President Barack Obama on climate and energy issues, among other policy matters.  Reuters recently reported that Tesla has set aside plans to make a more affordable new EV at Musk’s direction. The strategy shift includes a greater focus on developing a “robotaxi” and comes amid steep competition including from BYD and other Chinese automakers with more affordable electric cars.  Patel and Baglino had been deeply involved in battery and vehicle manufacturing, related policy, and turning Tesla into a multinational EV manufacturer. They were less involved in autonomous vehicle technology at Tesla.   Baglino wrote in a post on X:  “I made the difficult decision to move on from Tesla after 18 years yesterday. I am so thankful to have worked with and learned from the countless incredibly talented people at Tesla over the years. I loved tackling nearly every problem we solved as a team and feel gratified to have contributed to the mission of accelerating the transition to sustainable energy, a mission that I am quite passionate about.”  Musk responded on the platform, “Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Few have contributed as much as you.”  As of Monday morning, Tesla had not yet updated the “leadership” information on its corporate webpage to reflect Baglino’s departure.  Patel wrote in a post on the social network, “The past 8 years at Tesla have been filled with every emotion — but the feeling I have today is utmost gratitude,” adding, “My immigrant parents worked their asses off and as a result I’m the luckiest dude. Lucky to have been a part of @BarackObama’s campaign/administration, and truly honored to have worked at @Tesla to positively changing multiple industries.”  Musk replied to Patel, saying, “Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Much appreciated.”  The CEO also said, in a post on X on Monday, “About every 5 years, we need to reorganize and streamline the company for the next phase of growth.”  Baglino and Patel were not immediately available for comment.

The Class A shares have lagged behind the S&P 500 by about nine percentage points during the current quarter and now are up about 16% in 2023. That compares with a roughly 26% total return for the index.   The shares are up an annualized 12% in the last 10 years, slightly behind the 12.2% yearly total return, including dividends, for the index. Berkshire also is behind the S&P 500 over the past five years with a 13.4% annualized return, compared with 16.4% for the index., according to Bloomberg calculations.  Berkshire’s Class A shares were up 0.3% Friday to $542,600 while the Class B stock was 0.1% higher at $356.47.  The stock is roughly even with the index over the past 20 years with a 9.8% annualized return. That is despite dramatic growth in the company’s operating profits and Buffett’s coup in buying Apple stock, which is showing a nearly $150 billion gain for Berkshire.   Berkshire stock’s lagging performance shows how difficult it is for even an investor of Buffett’s stature to beat an index driven by powerful megacap tech stocks, especially given Berkshire’s huge size. Its asset base is about $1 trillion.  It isn’t clear why the stock is lagging behind the market lately. The company is finishing what likely will be a record year for profits. After-tax operating earnings could rise more than 25% to nearly $40 billion in 2023.   Berkshire’s big property and casualty insurance business is humming as Geico, the auto insurance unit, undergoes a profit turnaround. Berkshire’s $350 billion equity portfolio is topping the market this year led by Apple, which has gained 55% this year to about $194 a share. Apple accounts for nearly half the portfolio.  The Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, another of Berkshire’s key businesses, is more valuable this quarter thanks to the rally in shares of its chief rival, Union Pacific could be worth $150 billion, in line with Union Pacific, while all of Berkshire is now valued at about $775 billion.  Berkshire also is benefiting from the sharp rise in short-term interest rates since early 2022. The company is sitting on more than $150 billion in cash that is mostly invested in U.S. Treasury bills yielding above 5%.  It could be that investors anticipate lower earnings on the cash next year, reasoning that the Federal Reserve may well cut short-term rates.  There also could be concern about Buffet’s age. He turned 93 in August, writing last month that he feels “good” but saying he is fully aware he is “playing in extra innings.” The fact that Berkshire could soon lose the leader that built the company over nearly 60 years was highlighted by the recent death of Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger at 99.   Barron’s recently named Berkshire as a top stock for 2024 based on what looks like a reasonable valuation at 20 times projected 2024 earnings. The company is valued at 1.4 times our estimate of year-end 2023 book value of about $390,000 per class A share.  Buffett may not have many years left at the helm but he seems as sharp and engaged as ever. He could still find the elephant-size acquisition totaling $50 billion or more that he has long sought.  While he said last year that Berkshire has no interest in owning Occidental Petroleum  , Buffett could change his mind. Berkshire continues to add to its stake and now owns about 28% of the energy company. Occidental is valued at more than $50 billion, meaning Berkshire could well snap it up.  https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-hathaway-stock-warren-buffett-underperform-f9539619";"374";"2023-12-24T22:18:06"
"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says he's committed to cost cutting while investing in AI in shareholder letter";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1c1ckwh/amazon_ceo_andy_jassy_says_hes_committed_to_cost/";"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on Thursday published his annual shareholder letter, where he pledged to keep looking for ways to keep costs in check even as the company doubles down on investing in new growth areas like artificial intelligence.  “I think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one of our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers’ lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we’re investing,” Jassy wrote in his third shareholder letter since taking the helm at Amazon from former CEO Jeff Bezos, who stepped down in 2021.  Under Jassy, Amazon has morphed into a leaner version of itself, as slowing sales and a challenging economy pushed the company to eschew the relentless growth of the Bezos years. Beginning at the end of 2022 and continuing through 2023, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs. Those cuts have continued this year, with Amazon announcing layoffs in its cloud computing, Prime Video and Twitch livestreaming units, among others.  Even amid a period of retrenchment in some areas, Jassy said he’s focused on finding new areas of growth within the company so that Amazon remains “resilient.” He stressed the importance of building “primitive services,” which he described as “discrete, foundational building blocks” that can spur new projects and businesses.  Jassy used Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing division, as an example. Before he became Amazon’s CEO, Jassy oversaw the creation of AWS, which grew from an internal tool to become the dominant cloud service and one of Amazon’s most profitable businesses.  He said he believes generative artificial intelligence stands to be Amazon’s next “primitive service” that could transform the company. “We’re optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS,” Jassy wrote.  Amazon on Thursday added Andrew Ng, a renowned AI pioneer who previously led Google Brain and was a scientist at Baidu, to its board. Ng will replace Judy McGrath, who has sat on the board since 2014.  In the past year, Amazon has made a flurry of AI announcements as the field exploded, causing tech companies to pour money into the space. Last month, Amazon added $2.75 billion to its stake in AI startup Anthropic in its largest venture investment yet. Jassy has also pledged to infuse AI into every one of Amazon’s businesses.

"Xiaomi releases electric car $4K cheaper than Tesla's Model 3 as price wars heat up";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bpy94c/xiaomi_releases_electric_car_4k_cheaper_than/";"Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi said Thursday it will sell its first car for far less than Tesla’s Model 3, as price wars heat up in China’s fiercely competitive electric car market.  Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said the standard version of the SU7 will sell for 215,900 yuan ($30,408) in the country — a price he acknowledged would mean the company was selling each car at a loss.  Tesla’s Model 3 starts at 245,900 yuan in China.  Lei claimed the standard version of the SU7 beat the Model 3 on more than 90% of its specifications, except on two aspects that he said it might take Xiaomi at least three to five years to catch up with Tesla on. He also said the SU7 had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus the Model 3′s 606 kilometers. The company said orders had exceeded 50,000 cars in the 27 minutes since sales started at 10 p.m. Beijing time Thursday.  Deliveries are set to start by the end of April, Lei said. Lei also claimed that Xiaomi’s car factory, for which all “key” steps are fully automated, can produce an SU7 every 76 seconds. It was not immediately clear whether the factory was fully operational.  Earlier this week, the Xiaomi CEO said on social media the SU7 would be the best sedan “under 500,000 yuan” ($69,328).  The car is entering a fiercely competitive market in China, where companies are launching a slew of new models and cutting prices in order to survive. Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has partnered with traditional automakers, most notably launching the Aito brand whose vehicles are often on display in Huawei smartphone showrooms.  Tesla’s Model 3 is the best-selling new energy sedan in China that has a driving range of at least 600 kilometers (372 miles) and costs less than 500,000 yuan, according to data from industry website Autohome.  BYD’s Han sedan starts at 169,800 yuan, according to Autohome.  Nio’s ET5 starts at 298,000 yuan, while Xpeng’s P7 starts at 209,900 yuan, the data showed. Geely-owned Zeekr’s 007 sedan starts at 209,900 yuan, according to Autohome.  Sales of new energy vehicles, which include battery-only powered cars, have surged in China to account for about one-third of new passenger cars sold, according to the China Passenger Car Association.  Accessories  The heads of competing electric car startups Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto were among the featured guests at the Xiaomi SU7 launch event.  Lei on Thursday showed off a range of accessories such as an in-car refrigerator, a custom front-window shade, and a smartphone holder, some available for free with a car purchase before the end of April, and others for a separate price.  The SU7 supports Apple’s Car Play and can integrate with the iPad, Lei said. He also revealed driver-assist tech for highways and cities, set to be fully available in China in August.  Tesla’s Autopilot for driver assist on highways is available in China, but the company’s “Full Self Driving” for city streets has yet to be released in the country.  Despite saying Xiaomi wanted to compete with Porsche at a car tech event in December, Lei acknowledged that the SU7 had longer to go before it might be able to compete at this more premium level. He announced that the “Max” version of the SU7, aimed as a competitor with Porsche’s Taycan, would sell for 299,900 yuan.  Ecosystem of devices  The SU7 is part of Xiaomi’s recently launched “Human x Car x Home” strategy that seeks to build an ecosystem of devices connected to its new HyperOS operating system. Most of the company’s revenue is from phones, with just under 30% coming from appliances and other consumer products.  Although Xiaomi is generally known for more affordable products, its President Lu Weibing told CNBC earlier this year the company has been pursuing a premiumization strategy since 2020 — and that there are about 20 million users in that price segment who might buy the SU7.  Lu told CNBC that the SU7 will first be sold to consumers in China, and that it would take at least two to three years for any overseas launch.  The company showed off the car at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in late February, following a reveal of the vehicle’s exterior and tech in Beijing in late December.

"Why Is Tesla Prices Not Affected From Recalls?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18l5uqj/why_is_tesla_prices_not_affected_from_recalls/";"Hello!   I have started trading for about 6 months and I am always playing safe and trying to understand the trends.    One thing I really find strange is sometimes companies are really affected by the on-going events and sometimes they are not affected at all. I will give a few examples:  1. Tesla stocks have not affected even though they had to recall 2M cars in US.  2. Apple had a significant drop when Chinese government blocked gov. employees using iPhones.   So in my small mind, Tesla has had a much greater problem yet the stock price is unaffected, and apple got significantly hit for a smaller issue.   I would expect Tesla would've been affected in a similar way, but didn't. Is there an explanation?   Thank you in advance!";"0";"2023-12-18T11:45:47"
"Twitter-backer knocks billions off its value after Musk’s ‘go f--- yourself’ outburst";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18wa19t/twitterbacker_knocks_billions_off_its_value_after/";"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/twitter-backer-knocks-billions-off-192028495.html  >An investor in Twitter has written down the value of its stake by $2.85bn (£2.2bn) after Elon Musk told boycotting advertisers to “go f— yourself”.  Fidelity, which helped Mr Musk buy the company for $44bn (£35bn) in 2022, now believes the company is worth 71.5pc less than at the time of purchase.  The US investment giant had already slashed the value of its investment by 65pc at the end of October but deepened the discount in November. It came in the same month that Twitter’s billionaire owner launched a tirade against advertisers.  Speaking at a New York Times conference, Mr Musk claimed a boycott by advertisers was going to “kill” the company, adding: “If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go f--- yourself.”  Apple, IBM and Disney are among the major brands to cut ties with the social media platform, amid concerns about lax moderation under Mr Musk and the billionaire’s freewheeling personal style.  Fidelity’s valuation cut, which was first reported by Axios, gives the company a notional value of just $12.5bn and suggests Twitter has lost $2.85bn of worth in the eyes of Fidelity in just four weeks.  The investment group, which contributed more than $300m to Mr Musk’s takeover, does not disclose how it values privately held companies. Other shareholders may value their stakes differently.  However, Twitter’s own internal stock plan for staff valued the company at just $19bn in October – less than half the sum Mr Musk paid for it.";"933";"2024-01-02T00:25:28"

Airbnb has made its first acquisition as a public company, in a deal valued at just under $200 million, sources familiar with the deal told CNBC.  The startup is called Gameplanner.AI, which has been in “stealth mode” since its founding in 2020. Startups in stealth mode operate out of the public eye for various reasons, such as to protect intellectual property or avoid distractions. Gameplanner.AI will accelerate some of Airbnb’s AI projects, according to Airbnb.  Gameplanner.AI was cofounded by Adam Cheyer, one of the founders of Siri. When Siri was acquired by Apple, he worked alongside Steve Jobs. Cheyer later co-founded Viv Labs, which would become the foundation for Samsung’s voice assistant.  Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has said that generative AI will radically change the platform and that he wants to use it as a “travel concierge” that learns about users over time and enhances their travel experiences -- for example, matching users with the right rooms or homes.   This deal is Airbnb’s first acquisition since 2019 and could pique some interest on Wall Street as to whether Chesky’s M&A strategy is shifting, potentially making Airbnb a more attractive acquisition. The company is profitable on a GAAP basis and held $11 billion in cash and liquid assets as of the end of September.  Airbnb’s news follows reports that Google is in talks to invest hundreds of millions into another AI startup, Character.AI, which in March raised a $150 million at a $1 billion valuation in a funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz. The startup lets people create virtual characters or chat with AI versions of celebrities like Elon Musk or Albert Einstein.";"408";"2023-11-14T18:53:39"

"Once a Hot Stock-Market Trend Has a Name, Its Best Days Are Likely to be over";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b3xvkb/once_a_hot_stockmarket_trend_has_a_name_its_best/";"Derek Horstmeyer(repost)  *Once a stock-market trend has been identified and named -- think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven -- the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.*      *To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Marín Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.*      *The final list of named trends we researched was:*      *-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.*      *-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.*      *-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.*      *-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestlé, L'Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.*      *-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.*      *-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.*      *-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.*      *-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce*      *Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.*      *From first mention*      *Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.*      *For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S&P 500.*      *The first interesting finding: When we look at the average of all these eight named trends, we see considerable price run-up before the trade being named. For the 24 months before the zero-date, we see the average named trend deliver 36% in excess returns. This means that if you magically knew about a new named trend before it happened, you could earn 36 percentage points above the S&P 500 for the two years before it was named.*      *Worth the ride, until...*      *But even if you don't have this magical foresight, it still doesn't hurt to ride a trend once it has been coined. On average, once the trend has been named and looking ahead 12 months, an investor can still earn about 13 percentage points in excess returns.*      *Yet 12 months following the naming is about the best you can do as returns peak at this point on average and decrease a bit subsequently. From the 12-month mark to the 24-month mark after a trend has been named, the average named trend lags behind the S&P 500 by about 2 percentage points.*      *When we look at the individual named trends, it might surprise people that the two best trades from the zero-date to the 24-month mark in our sample were the BAT and Cloud trends -- both earning more than 60% in excess return over the two-year period once they were coined by the press.*      *On the other end, the MT SAAS trade did the worst, dropping more than 95% in excess returns over the two-year period after being named.*      *All in all, this means your best option is to jump on a named trend as soon as you first hear about it -- provided you haven't been too late to the party -- and ride the initial momentum, if it happens. But if you get in past the 12-month mark, the returns might not be so magnificent.*";"156";"2024-03-01T17:04:21"

So, this post could sound somewhat uninformed (because it is).  Now, Apple is worth $3T because of the price that its stock is trading at. That's the price that the people interested in buying Apple stock are willing to pay for it because they believe that's how much the company is worth. The same goes for every other asset like houses, gold, paintings, currencies etc. They're worth as much as people value them.  Now, when it comes to houses, I can understand why people value them: they can actually live in them and better houses provide for a greater standard of living. People have an incentive in buying houses other than the fact that their prices will go up. Gold also has aesthetic and scientific value. Paintings have aesthetic value. Currencies enable you to trade with countries that operate in them.  However, I don't fully understand why people value stocks and how buying stocks is different than buying worthless rocks.  What's the market's incentive in trying to get the market value of a company closely resemble its perceived value?

"Nintendo is an “inevitable” now – a high-return secular growth juggernaut that should just keep getting bigger and more profitable with time";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cbwzm7/nintendo_is_an_inevitable_now_a_highreturn/";"Nintendo is an “inevitable” now – a high-return secular growth juggernaut that should just keep getting bigger and more profitable with time. Better yet, with Nintendo’s IP flywheel finally in full effect, the earnings snowball you were first told about many years ago is not only rolling and getting bigger, but it’s set to accelerate as higher-powered hardware drops in the near term and the software release slate normalizes thereafter.   Which brings us to another key reason to celebrate Nintendo’s fast-approaching “through the looking glass” moment: **It's not just about its dedicated videogame platform business. Nintendo has been taking steps to diversify its income streams for years outside of its core business of videogames by slowly and successfully monetizing its IP via theme parks, movies, and other capital-efficient avenues that are just now beginning to reveal themselves.** It’s still early innings, mind you, but we’re happy to report that years of constant assertions that Nintendo would shy away from properly monetizing its gold-plated portfolio of unrivaled IP look positively ridiculous in hindsight. With the blockbuster success of the Super Mario movie, as well as its theme park and other IP-related initiatives approaching critical mass, Nintendo today has multiple sources of high incremental margin revenue that will begin to snowball over the next several years.    To say the same thing a slightly different way, the quality and visibility of Nintendo’s business in early 2024 is radically superior and less risky relative to what it was at any point in its roughly 13-decade history, even if these structural improvements are not broadly appreciated as such. Furthermore, now that Nintendo is armed with the market-leading Switch platform and a self-sustaining IP flywheel on the far side of exit velocity, we remain more confident than ever about its efforts to properly leverage its Apple-like ecosystem of hardware, software, and services across its loyal, 122 million+ strong global customer base.    **Let's recap why we think Nintendo is slowly but surely sending old bear arguments into permanent hibernation:**   1. Nintendo just printed its highest TTM revenue and operating profit figures in the Switch platform’s history, seven years into an aging console ""cycle,"" despite having released only two top-tier first-party “system sellers” over the previous 18 months.   2. Nintendo’s Apple-like ecosystem (reinforced by a very Disney-like IP content flywheel) has radically improved the economic resiliency and visibility of Nintendo’s revenue and cash flow, de-cyclifying its earnings power in lockstep.   3. With the release of the Switch 2, Nintendo is primed for continued massive margin expansion by reaching a previously untapped market for the company’s consoles.  4.

And yes it sucks watching those stocks skyrocket. Luckily I get my entertainment from watching my long term TSLA position and recent RIVN shares fluctuate wildly.

"Which company are you willing to buy its shares but never their products/services?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13uw1t7/which_company_are_you_willing_to_buy_its_shares/";"I am curious if you all have such cases. I've learned over the years that it's easier to invest in companies whose products/services I use but it's not really the best strategy as personal biases apply (ex: I use ASOS a lot for my clothes but their share has been getting hammered since the post-pandemic peak).  So, I've decided to actually search for solid companies to buy, even if I don't buy their products. Two quick examples of mine:  1. AAPL: Probably the most well-run company in recent years. I never owned a single Apple product, as I've always considered them overpriced and my stubborn-ass being fixated on android phones and microsoft products. But I cannot dispute how well the company is ran and able to secure a loyal customer line and solid profit margins year after year.  2. TSLA: Personally, I don't ever plan on buying a Tesla car and I also don't really like Elon as a person. But I still have to acknowledge some of the advantages that Tesla has as a company, especially their data collecting systems. I think Tesla has a great future and even if I'm not a fan of Elon, I can still put my biases aside and realize that there's ton of experienced investors who trust him. He has a great track record of building companies so that's a risk I'm willing to take (TSLA is like 3-4% of my portfolio)  Do you have any similar examples?";"442";"2023-05-29T16:12:18"
"Review my AAPL stock prediction from 2022";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14529oe/review_my_aapl_stock_prediction_from_2022/";"Was I right in 2022? AAPL just touched a record $184.95. I argued that AAPL's changes that came during the pandemic would prevent it from collapsing back to pre-pandemic price points like most other stocks.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  [**Original post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sybtuk/6_reasons_why_aapl_isnt_a_pandemic_stock/)**:**  **tldr:** Pandemic stocks had no fundamental changes to their services and products in the last 2 years. AAPL had some substantial changes that came during the pandemic.  It makes a lot of sense that a lot of companies are normalizing back to pre-pandemic values because people are slowly easing back to normal life. This has led to crashes of 20-80% for many companies.  AAPL is still up \~100% since the pandemic. What are the reasons why AAPL won't drop back down too?  Here are my 6 reasons:  **People severely underestimated how much impact the Trump administration destroying Huawei phones had on Apple.** Apple benefited hugely as people bought iPhones instead of Huawei. In China, Apple is now the #1 smartphone maker again. Two years ago, I would have said this is impossible because of how strong Chinese phone makers have been and have been growing. In hindsight, the moment Trump announced the ban was the moment AAPL should have exploded.  **5G super-cycle** came during the pandemic  **Superior supply-chain management during the pandemic allowed Apple to gain permanent market shares.** In the US, the iPhone has surpassed Android in marketshare and is accelerating, which I thought would never happen again.  **Mac transitioned to Apple Silicon during the pandemic,** which is beating the pants off Intel and AMD chips in performance and performance per watt. Apple is now the fastest-growing computer maker and they're just getting started. The PC market is $150b/year, and Apple only has an 8% market share. If Apple is able to go up to 20 to 30%, that's a very respectable increase in revenue.  **Apple is expected to eventually enter some of the hottest markets during the pandemic** which were electric vehicles, self-driving cars, and the metaverse. While existing companies in those markets have dropped off, Apple hasn't even released a product for them yet. This means AAPL never actually caught the hype for these categories during the pandemic.  **Investors never really caught onto Apple's new strategy until recently which involves gaining market share and selling services.** Apple is no longer just serving the premium markets. The old saying ""Apple products are overpriced"" is no longer true. For $330, you can buy a new iPad. $250 and get the iPhone SE. $400 and get an iPhone SE. And I'm guessing Apple is planning a cheap Macbook SE to take PC market share too. These are excellent value products and serve as the entry points into Apple's iron grip ecosystem. Once you're in with one product, you can't get out. Next thing you know, you're buying Airpods every 2 years, subscribing to Apple Music, getting Apple Fitness+, upgrading to a Macbook Pro, using Apple Pay which gives Apple a % of the transaction, buying virtual items in stupid mobile games, etc...";"0";"2023-06-09T13:06:42"

They cited the ongoing AI boom as a key driver, expecting strong AI server momentum to surpass projections and continue outpacing supply. This trend is anticipated to persist through 2025, benefiting from a clearer understanding of US Cloud Service Providers' capital expenditures.      The bullish outlook aligns with Nvidia's impressive 2023 growth, with its shares surging over 200% year-to-date. The success of AI solutions like ChatGPT has stimulated this growth and propelled Nvidia into the ranks of trillion-dollar companies, alongside Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia's upcoming fiscal Q2 2024 earnings report is highly anticipated after the company's optimistic guidance of $11 billion in revenue, a substantial leap from Wall Street's $7.15 billion estimate.

The company will be conducting a search for the permanent CEO successor. A spokesperson for OpenAI didn’t immediately return The Verge’s call for comment.   This is an extremely sudden turn of events. Just last week, Altman keynoted at the company’s DevDay conference, where it announced a suite of major new updates to compete with other big tech companies like Microsoft and Google. OpenAI arguably kickstarted the current AI arms race with last year’s hugely-popular ChatGPT.  Microsoft, which has invested billions in OpenAI, tells The Verge it will continue to partner with the company. “We have a long-term partnership with OpenAI and Microsoft remains committed to Mira and their team as we bring this next era of AI to our customers,” according to a statement sent by Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw.  Altman has reportedly talked with Jony Ive, Apple’s former chief design officer, about making the “iPhone of artificial intelligence,” though Altman downplayed those rumors at a recent Wall Street Journal conference. He’s also the biggest shareholder in Humane, which just launched orders for its Humane AI Pin.  Altman was a co-founder of OpenAI and initially served as a co-chair of the company alongside Elon Musk. Musk left in 2018 to avoid a conflict of interest with Tesla.   OpenAI also announced that co-founder Greg Brockman will be stepping down as chairman of the board, though Brockman will remain at the company.";"972";"2023-11-17T21:45:15"

Gelsinger added that following on from Meteor Lake (expected to be launched later this month), Intel will be ramping its Intel 3 process (5 nm) “soon”.

TSMC also claims it is on track for its own 2 nm process node in 2025 and already enjoys the patronage of major customers including Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD, MediaTek along with Apple. Undoubtedly, Intel will be keen to secure at least one of these companies as it helps with its own economies of scale as investing in each of these new process nodes is a multi-billion-dollar endeavor.

"Tech leaders are calling for an A.I. pause because they have no product ready, Palantir CEO says";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1453tou/tech_leaders_are_calling_for_an_ai_pause_because/";"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/09/tech-leaders-ai-pause-no-product-ready-palantir.html  Palantir’s boss Alex Karp opposes the idea of a pause in artificial intelligence research, in contrast to an open letter from the Future of Life Institute signed by some of the biggest names in the tech industry. The letter, which has garnered over 31,000 signatures including names like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, called for a pause on AI research on models larger than GPT-4, which powers tools such as ChatGPT. The letter also said that if “such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.” Speaking to BBC Radio in an interview broadcast Thursday, Karp said he is of the view that “many of the people asking for a pause, are asking for a pause because they have no product.”  He added, without naming anyone, that this is because “people who have nothing to offer want to study AI,” but by taking a pause, this could lead to adversaries stealing a lead in not only commercial applications, but also military applications. To him, “studying this and allowing other people to win both on commercial areas and on the battlefield” is a really bad strategy. When asked if what he wanted was an “A.I. race” akin to the arms race of the Cold War, Karp simply stated that “there is already an A.I. arms race, it’s just we’re ahead, [and] it’s not like if we slow down, the AI race will stop.”  He pointed out that the “single most important event” in this race is not large language models like GPT-4, but instead how AI has been utilized in military applications. Karp points out that Ukrainian forces have used Palantir technologies to gain a technological edge over invading Russian forces. A report from The Times in December 2022 revealed that Palantir’s AI has allowed Ukraine to increase the accuracy, speed and deadliness of its artillery strikes despite having comparatively smaller artillery forces. Palantir sells software to governments and private sector organizations which help them analyze large quantities of data. The advent of this AI-powered software on the battlefield “just throws down a gauntlet to every single country in the world,” Karp said. He added, “especially [to] our adversaries, they cannot afford for us to have this advantage. And so, the race is on. There’s only a question of do we stay ahead or do we cede the lead.”";"2193";"2023-06-09T14:24:41"

The losses are weighing on BofA's net interest margin, an important gauge of performance. BofA's stock has dropped 15% this year, making it the worst performer of any of its large rivals.      Although BoA insists that these losses are merely on paper and it doesn't intend to sell these bonds, the reality remains that the bank's potential to generate income from its customer deposits could be significantly limited.      The losses are the result of a strategy the bank implemented three years ago, when it pumped $670 billion in pandemic-era deposit inflows into debt markets.      The value of BofA's securities portfolio has plunged as yields have risen and bond prices have fallen. At that time, bond prices were high and yields were low. However, as yields have risen and bond prices have dropped, BoA has seen a staggering loss in the value of its portfolio. This loss is double the figure reported by its biggest peers, reflecting the bank's aggressive strategy to favor bonds over cash.      BofA's chief financial officer, Alastair Borthwick, said the bank is in the process of winding down its securities investments.";"564";"2023-06-30T15:54:30"

As of recently, Google and Meta decide to begin giving out dividends to its shareholders. Is this seen as bullish?   We hold big tech firms due to huge earning growth potential and they tend to distribute their earnings into innovation and R&D, which will with no doubt boost their future earning if done right.   Now that Google and Meta begin to give out dividend, it seems appealing for mutual fund managers to add more into their portfolios, which will boost their stock prices further. But this will probably hurt their future earning potential in long term as they will have less allocated to R&D. What do y'all think?

"Ultimate Nvidia DD (The Best)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1asfjmv/ultimate_nvidia_dd_the_best/";"First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens.      It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark.   No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space.      First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently?      You could say it’s because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood.   It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT.      AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks.      How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype?   Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it’s not just any Product. It’s a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.   An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand.      This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).      This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW.      They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party.      How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else.      Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts:      \- Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees      \- Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to)      \- Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development)      \- Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers      The Analogy:      „Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood).      TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees.      The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.      At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture.      Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.      Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market.      What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process.      Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“      \----      NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips.      Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that’s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn’t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture.      NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them.      Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC.   TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple.      So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them.      There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.      So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel.   Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD?   This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design.      Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough.      AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips.      Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again.      According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.      Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?!      Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so:      „However, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration.      Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple’s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.“ (Does Apple use Nvidia? (ts2.com.pl)      Because you are all regarded, here are the links where major companies have declared that they will design their own chips:      Microsoft: Microsoft is finally making custom chips — and they’re all about AI - The Verge      Meta: Exclusive: Meta to deploy in-house custom chips this year to power AI drive - memo | Reuters      Google: Google Training Gemini On Its Own Chips Reveals Another Of Its Advantages (forbes.com)      ChatGPT: Exclusive: ChatGPT-owner OpenAI is exploring making its own AI chips | Reuters      In the meantime, Meta and Microsoft say they will buy AMDS new AI Chip as an alternative to Nvidia: Meta and Microsoft to buy AMD's new AI chip as alternative to Nvidia (cnbc.com)      Since I feel so validated by the links above, I'll stop writing my DD, which would have additionally dealt with NVIDIA's past as a company (acquisitions) and the tricks to gain advantage in the consumer graphics card market (Raytracing, PhysiX).";"5";"2024-02-16T19:18:36"

"Facebook wants to charge EU users $14 a month if they don't agree to personalized ads on Facebook and Instagram";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16yumhc/facebook_wants_to_charge_eu_users_14_a_month_if/";"Meta is considering introducing subscription-based, ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram in Europe. The move aims to comply with the EU's new ad privacy regulations. The subscription fee would start at around €10 ($10.50) for desktop users and rise to about $14 for mobile users, accounting for commissions charged by Apple and Google's app stores. The subscription model is still under review for compliance with EU laws. This comes after Meta faced a $1.3 billion fine from European regulators for data privacy violations.  **Regulatory Arbitrage**: Meta's decision can be viewed as a form of regulatory arbitrage, aimed at circumventing the stringent data privacy laws enforced by the European Union. Given the EU's propensity for imposing substantial fines, this move could serve as a risk mitigation strategy, thereby stabilizing the company's regulatory profile.  **Revenue Diversification and Financial Stability**: The introduction of a subscription-based revenue model is a strategic pivot away from the increasingly volatile ad-based revenue streams. This diversification could serve to stabilize Meta's cash flows, thereby making it a more attractive and less risky investment in the long term.  **Market Test for Global Scalability**: The European market will act as a bellwether for the viability of this new revenue model. A successful implementation in Europe could pave the way for a global rollout, offering a significant upside potential for revenue growth and stock appreciation.  **Industry Precedence and Competitive Moats**: By being the first to introduce a subscription-based model in the social media landscape, Meta has the opportunity to build a competitive moat. This first-mover advantage could deter competitors from entering the space, thereby consolidating Meta's market share and potentially driving up its valuation.  **User Adoption as a Leading Indicator**: The rate of user adoption will serve as a leading indicator for the success of this initiative. High adoption rates could signify a paradigm shift in consumer preferences, moving away from ad-supported to subscription-based models. This could have a ripple effect on Meta's long-term revenue and profitability metrics.

"S&P 500 rallies 1% to all-time high, surpassing previous record set in 2022: Live updates";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19au3bn/sp_500_rallies_1_to_alltime_high_surpassing/";"The S&P 500 closed at an all-time high on Friday as investors returned to buying equities in force in recent days following a short-lived market stumble to start the new year.  The S&P 500 rose 1.23% to settle at 4,839.81, surpassing both the prior record intraday and closing highs. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which set its own record at the end of last year, added 395.19 points, or 1.05%. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.7%. The smaller, more tech-focused Nasdaq-100 gained 1.8% to also hit a record high.  All three major averages are now in positive territory for 2024, with the 30-stock Dow going green during Friday's rally.  Following a 19% loss in 2022, the S&P 500 roared back in 2023, posting a 24% gain as the economy skirted a recession that many had expected and inflation came down to levels that allowed the Federal Reserve to pause its interest rate hikes. The benchmark came close to reaching a record following a forceful fourth-quarter rally, but ultimately fell short. The market rally paused a bit to start 2024 as investors took some profits in the Big Tech leaders like Apple.  But they returned to buying those tech leaders in recent days. Friday's milestone confirms that the stock market is officially in a bull market that began in October 2022, and not just a bounce within a bear market. The S&P 500 is up more than 35% since that low.  ""In the mind of the investor, [companies] leading in AI or having a product set that's differentiated in the tech space are very, very strongly leading the market. That's been a wave that's persisted throughout the remainder of last year and into 2024,"" said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.  The tech sector gained 2.1% on Friday and jumped more than 4% during the trading week, making it the S&P 500's best-performing sector week to date.  Whether the broader market index can maintain its growth momentum in 2024 ""is going to be a question of whether the Fed is able to stick a soft landing or not,"" Stucky said. He noted that the driver of the S&P 500's growth in 2023 was tied to multiples, rather than earnings.  ""Multiples rise coming out of economic slowdowns, because investors are pricing in a recovery. If that recovery doesn't materialize, then you do have to question the sustainability of not only holding on to new highs, but making new highs beyond that,"" Stucky added.  Fresh consumer data on Friday indicated that consumers are becoming more confident on the economy and inflation. The University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers showed a 21.4% year-over-year jump to reach its highest level since July 2021.  Insurance company Travelers rose more than 5% after posting an earnings beat. Schlumberger gained nearly 2% after beating on top and bottom lines, and Ally Financial surged over 10% after reporting strong quarterly results and a sale of a business unit to Synchrony Financial.  https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/01/18/stock-market-today-live-updates.html";"1349";"2024-01-19T22:20:02"

Earnings so far are fine — not disastrous as Mr. Wilson of Morgan Stanley has predicted, and even his target for year end is 3900, so I think we should be comfortably above that at year end, i.e. at or above where we are right now.  That of course will not be true if there will be a credit event, but I think the chance is very small, and the government would step in as they did in March.  However I do think the magnificent 7 will likely underperform, as their valuations are stretched. Among them I’m most concerned about Apple, as it’s the most susceptible to consumers and also to geopolitical risks.  For the next two months I will be closely watching rates and looking for opportunities in fixed income, utilities, energy, and reits.

"Has Spotify run up too much? They have a margin problem";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b6mjm1/has_spotify_run_up_too_much_they_have_a_margin/";"Spotify stock has gone on a huge tear lately, almost quadrupling its stock price from a recent low around USD 70-75 to currently over 271. I’m sure this has to do with several consecutive earnings reports in which they demonstrated that they could:  1. Increase the number of subscribers and even re-accelerate growth despite their huge size 2. Squeeze more money from subscribers and increase ARPU, despite growing quickly outside of Europe and the USA where revenue per user tends to be lower.    While this is positive news and doubling premium subscribers since 2020 (while facing heavy competition) is impressive, I’m struggling to see how they will ever turn this revenue into profit.   The problem is twofold:   1. Spotify is totally beholden to major music labels which operate in an oligopolistic market. Spotify pays royalties to labels whenever a song is played, and they cannot at all afford to lose any of the labels. No one would use a music streaming service that is missing the entire catalogue of all major artists signed to one of the labels. So as Spotify gets more users, not only do they automatically have to pay more money for more plays, the labels can renegotiate and demand more money. This problem becomes apparent in their gross margins (more on that later).    2. Spotify is the only major pure play music streaming service. Their competition is Apple Music, Google/Youtube Premium, Amazon Prime. Excluding China, these make up well over 90% of the global market, but all their competitors have far more ability to bundle their services/subscriptions and run the music streaming at loss/breakeven by increasing royalty payments. Now, Spotify holds about 30% of the global market share compared to Apple Music at 13.7%, Amazon at 13.3% and Google at 9% (according to MIDIA Research). So they are the market leader by far which has its benefits. But switching streaming providers, while not totally painless, is easy enough that I believe they would lose a lot of subscribers if they raise prices too high.    A few numbers that seem to underline my thoughts:   In 2023 they raised premium prices for the first time ever(!) in the USA, to 10.99. This is the same exact price as Apple and YouTube Music (without YouTube Premium). While a good deal for customers, it shows they have no pricing power.    Their gross margin in the last quarter was 25.6%. Not only is this in fact lower than their gross margin right after their IPO 6 years ago (25.7%), it is a margin that doesn’t seem to support their valuation of 3.6 currently.    Premium subscriptions are their main source of revenue at 86% of total revenue. This number has not changed in over 2 years. Ad supported revenue not only has a terrible 11.6% gross margin but is not growing in a meaningful way.    Their other initiatives like podcasting and some hardware experiments have mostly failed. In fact they decided to release the Joe Rogan podcast on other services despite sinking several hundred millions into it. they are now trying to push audiobooks and merch sales as new profit drivers. Those are nice to have but I doubt they’ll make a meaningful difference. It seems to me if you are enough of a fan of an artist to buy their merch, you will just do it on their Website.    Their one positive seems to be increasing free cash flow, which has roughly doubled in the past three years. They seem to be succeeding at generating some operating leverage. However with a 26% gross margin their biggest cost driver by far remains royalty payments.    I guess the stock has some appeal as the market leader and main pure play publicly listed music streaming company, but to me it seems like a short candidate.

"Disney - earnings discussion";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/162k6ez/disney_earnings_discussion/";"DIS has made the decision to further up its streaming monetization efforts by adopting paid sharing starting in 2024, following NFLX's lead. These price increases come on top of those for Hulu and Disney+ Premium (ad-free) that will increase by 20% and 30%, respectively, starting in October 2023. While these initiatives may accelerate the company's top and bottom-line growth, it is still unclear whether they will be able to increase Disney+'s dwindling US streaming market share to 13% by Q2 of 23.    Long-term, the well-diversified entertainment options provided by DIS, including ESPN and sports betting, across resorts, theme parks, cruises, and streaming, might be a real franchise flywheel. Able to set itself apart from rivals and preserve an alluring value proposition for clients. Disney and Apple have a number of intriguing partnerships for the Vision Pro spatial headset, which will feature Disney+ streaming video and immersive 4D gaming experiences. Although the headset won't be available until early 2024, the media company will probably benefit from its strong IP portfolio and increasingly varied revenue prospects.    Netflix, unlike Disney, has not yet increased pricing, but it has also subtly discontinued the cheapest ad-free package, thereby increasing overall subscription and advertisement profits. Since more customers are likely to switch to ad-supported rates as a result of less discretionary spending, an elevated interest rate environment, and increased ad-free streaming plans, these moves are undoubtedly deliberate.   However, Disney investors should also be aware of Disney+'s diminishing streaming market share in the US, which will drop to 13% by Q2 23 (a 5% decrease from December 2022 and a 2% YoY increase).

"JPM Net Income Surge 67% YoY to $14.5 Billion";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14ze43n/jpm_net_income_surge_67_yoy_to_145_billion/";"JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings Friday that topped analysts’ expectations as the company benefited from higher interest rates and growing interest income.  * Earnings: $4.37 per share adjusted vs. $4 per share Refinitiv estimate * Revenue: $42.4 billion vs. $38.96 billion estimate  Net income surged 67% to $14.5 billion, or $4.75 per share. When excluding the impact of its First Republic acquisition in early May — a $2.7 billion “bargain purchase gain” from the government-brokered takeover, as well as loan reserve builds and securities losses tied to the purchase — earnings were $4.37 per share.  Revenue rose 34% to $42.4 billion as JPMorgan took advantage of higher rates and solid loan growth. Revenue gains were fueled by a 44% jump in net interest income to $21.9 billion, which topped the StreetAccount estimate by roughly $700 million. Average loans climbed 13%, while deposits fell 6%.  Shares of the bank climbed more than 2% in premarket trading.  JPMorgan has been a standout recently on several fronts. Whether it’s about deposits, funding costs or net interest income — all hot-button topics since the regional banking crisis began in March — the bank has outperformed smaller peers.  That’s helped shares of the bank climb 11% so far this year, compared with the 16% decline of the KBW Bank Index. When JPMorgan last reported results in April, its shares had their biggest earnings-day increase in two decades.  This time around, JPMorgan will have the benefit of owning First Republic after its U.S.-brokered takeover in early May.  The acquisition, which added roughly $203 billion in loans and securities and $92 billion in deposits, may help cushion JPMorgan against some of the headwinds faced by the industry. Banks are losing low-cost deposits as customers find higher-yielding places to park their cash, causing the industry’s funding costs to rise.  That’s pressuring the industry’s profit margins. Last month, several regional banks disclosed lower-than-expected interest revenue, and analysts expect more banks to do the same in coming weeks. On top of that, banks are expected to disclose a slowdown in loan growth and rising costs related to commercial real estate debt, all of which squeeze banks’ bottom lines.  Lenders have begun setting aside more loan-loss provisions on expectations for a slowing economy this year. JPMorgan is expected to post a $2.72 billion provision for credit losses, according to the StreetAccount estimate.  The bank won’t be able to sidestep downturns faced in other areas, namely, the slowdown in trading and investment banking activity. In May, JPMorgan said revenue from those Wall Street activities was headed for a 15% decline from a year earlier.  Finally, analysts will want to hear what JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has to say about the health of the economy and his expectations for banking regulation and consolidation.  Wells Fargo also reported earnings Friday, and Citigroup results are on deck. Bank of America and Morgan Stanley report Tuesday.

We read all the time about startups having been founded by former Google employees. Seems like so often you hear about startup so and so being founded by former Google employees, or same employees leaving to fund a startup. It gets you thinking. How can Alphabet display such lack of clarity in their vision, lack of speed, attention, and focus in their other bets (I.e. waymo)?   How can Alphabet lack a gifted visionary when clearly there are so many there?  Is most of this talent locked out of leadership positions? And I get it. Not every talented employee can be CEO, or run every important business. But shouldn’t they have a real path to lead and run those positions and the brightest of them win?   I look at what’s there, and hear the current CEO, and he seems like a very nice guy, honestly, he does. I just don’t hear someone with a clear vision for growth, or excitement about how he wants to shape the future and contribute to humanity.   I also look at their Google Cloud ceo, and I walk away unimpressed. The CFO? She may be nice, but I just don’t see execution in streamlining operations to reach the same efficiency of Apple let’s say. And Apple has to run a much more complex operation spanning hundreds of suppliers, perhaps thousands, yet they do it.   Now leadership is talking about finding outside investors for their other bets businesses, what is supposed to be the innovation lab, chasing moonshots. Why seek outside investors? Do they not see any promise in any of their own startups to not invest more of the $100 billion plus in cash they hold? Strange.  Sam Altman should’ve been CEO of Google.";"0";"2024-01-31T04:06:50"

In these type of environments investors are going to move out of the safe tech bets (like Apple, Microsoft) and get back into more speculative, smaller cap names.  * I already hold stocks like Google, Amazon, and a lot of Apple & Tesla. I also wheel stocks like FB and Nvidia, so might get stuck with them as well.  Would love your opinions. Or if you just have general thoughts to share about equal vs market cap weighting, that's great as well.";"10";"2023-06-02T20:34:53"
"Short sellers are betting more than $1 trillion against US stocks after big run";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14hpvg1/short_sellers_are_betting_more_than_1_trillion/";"* Total US short interest exceeded $1 trillion as of last Friday, S3 Partners data shows. * The top five shorts are mega-cap tech stocks Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon * That comes after big stock market gains so far this year.  US short interest this month rose to the highest level since April 2022, as investors bet that the current bull run in the stock market is set to falter.  According to data from S3 Partners, the amount spent by short sellers against US stocks hit $1.02 trillion, as of Friday. Those bets came even as they continued to rally earlier this month, costing short sellers $101 billion.  S3 data shows that the top shorts are Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. As of Friday, their collective short interest topped $83 billion.  The bearish sentiment results from skepticism about how much higher stocks can go. So far this year, the S&P 500 is up 13.5%, and the Nasdaq is up 29%.  But since the Federal Reserve last week indicated more rate hikes are on the table this year, stocks have been on a losing streak.  This year, Wall Street has been caught up in the hype over artificial intelligence companies, which saw their valuations skyrocket and have brought more investors into the market due to ""fear of missing out.""  But big names have voiced divided outlooks on the AI frenzy. For instance, while Stanley Druckenmiller sees Nvidia as a stock worth holding for the next couple of years, short seller Jim Chanos has demonstrated skepticism towards the stock.  Meanwhile, the prospect of continued hawkishness from the Fed has added to macroeconomic risks. A recent Goldman Sachs report put the odds of a recession in the next 12 months at 25% and warned a downturn could cause a 23% decline in the S&P 500.  Still, if bullish investors win out, short positions could eventually support market gains, as a short squeeze forces more buying and boosts stocks.";"0";"2023-06-24T12:48:34"
"Investing in companies you don't use or even hate.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18tay8n/investing_in_companies_you_dont_use_or_even_hate/";"I'm wondering what the general consensus is on investing in companies you personally don't use or even prefer their competitors. I'm not talking about something like defense stocks like Lockheed or some reit or whatever. I'm wondering if people invest in Coca-Cola who don't even drink soda or even hate it for example. I ask because Starbucks stock and Nike stock have me interested but I'm wrestling with the idea that I don't even really like their products. I will literally walk past all the Nike shoes and clothes and go right for the new balances. Is believing in the company and leadership while also seeing value enough conviction and justification in owning the stock even when you personally don't buy their stuff?";"44";"2023-12-29T02:47:07"
"Intel in talks to serve as anchor for ARM IPO";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/149m5i7/intel_in_talks_to_serve_as_anchor_for_arm_ipo/";"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-talks-anchor-investor-arm-014951769.html  >Intel is in talks with SoftBank Group Corp's Arm to be an anchor investor in the chip designer's initial public offering (IPO), a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.  >Arm plans to sell its shares on Nasdaq later this year, seeking to raise between $8 billion and $10 billion, Reuters reported earlier in April.  Great idea for Intel to open a sizable position in ARM as the IPO anchor imo. Intel clearly missed most of the smartphone race apart from some modems before selling even that off, but getting tighter with ARM and becoming the best place to fabricate ARM parts would be a solid addition to the turnaround. Also hedges from singular Nvidia or Apple influence on ARM.";"173";"2023-06-15T01:10:50"
"Paramount cutting 25% of workforce and shutting down MTV News after disastrous earnings";"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13dxgfx/paramount_cutting_25_of_workforce_and_shutting/";"Bloomberg:  ""Paramount Global, looking to reduce costs as it copes with a loss of traditional TV viewers, is letting go of about 25% of the staff in its domestic cable networks and shutting down MTV News after four decades on the air.  Employees are being notified Tuesday, the company said in a statement. Paramount is combining nine separate teams into one. It had already announced plans to merge its Showtime and MTV studios  Despite subscriber growth and new hit shows, “We continue to feel pressure from broader economic headwinds like many of our peers,” said Chris McCarthy, head of the company’s media networks.  Paramount shares collapsed 30% last week after the company reported an 11 per cent decline in ad sales at its traditional TV networks and a US$511 million loss in streaming. The results underscore the challenges big media companies face in making the transition to online viewing.""  [Full article from Bloomberg here](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/paramount-cuts-25-domestic-cable-staff-ends-mtv-news)  This move also comes after a Wells Fargo analyst suggested that Paramount gets out of the streaming game altogether and go down the Sony route of selling their content to the highest bidder. He further argued that there's little point continuing to bludgeon money whilst fighting to be 5th place at best in the streaming wars (since there's little hope of beating Amazon, Apple, Disney, HBO, or Hulu).   Full article on that from [IndieWire here](https://www.indiewire.com/news/business/paramount-plus-quit-streaming-analyst-1234859135/)  Personally, I would have to agree. During an arms race like the Streaming Wars, you're better being an arms dealer (content) than trying to stake your own claim when you're in Paramount's position.";"390";"2023-05-10T19:27:55"
