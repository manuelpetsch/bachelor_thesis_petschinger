"Can Apple reverse its decline? Ever";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bbhstc/can_apple_reverse_its_decline_ever/";"Apple peaked with a double top last year and is down almost 20% from its all time high. Looks like that top is in.  Under Tim Cook, much like under Jobs, they continued to do extremely well for the investors. But under the hood was a different story for the last 12 years. Apple was transitioning from a product first to an operational efficiency first company. And Tim Cook is really really good at that, probably the best in the world. He focused on cost, profits and share buybacks. But he is not a dreamer or a visionary. Meanwhile the product visionaries like Jony Ive and Tony Fadell left.  So the products have suffered. Product revenue is shrinking  and has a negative annual growth rate. They’ve created nothing innovative since the iPhone. Ok sure they made a bigger iPhone (iPad) and a smaller iPhone with some sensors (watch). But what else?   Apple Car -  crashed and burned   Apple Card - Goldman maxed out their limit and foreclosed   Apple Vision Pro - Seriously? Seems to be a deal breaker with the ladies  What is going on with Apple management and the product people? Has Apple forgotten what made it great? Thoughts?    ";"0";"2024-03-10T19:52:24"

"9 reasons why Apple stock will fall dramatically after earnings on May 2,2024";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cfpv4o/9_reasons_why_apple_stock_will_fall_dramatically/";"9 reasons why Apple stock will fall dramatically after earnings on May 2,2024  At least a 5% further drop from $169 levels.To $160 or lower.  I just cannot see any good news except the fairly bullish open interest on the latest option contracts. But is that enough ?  Even Jim Cramer is quietly bearish as of April 24,2024.  Reason one. Apple had a death cross on March 14,2024.Just over 7 weeks ago. Long time to be under the 200 days moving average .  Current 200 days Simple Moving Average is $181.36 per share.  Current 50 days Simple Moving Average is $173.29 per share.  Current 14 days Relative Strength Index is a 47.33  Definitely not oversold by any means. In the low 30’s it would be oversold and ripe for a strong bounce.  In the case of Apple stock, its 50-day “line crossed below its 200-day line on March 14,2024.  The last time Apple did that was in June 2022, and the stock was already several weeks into a major decline.   The two lines touched again in September 2022 and the death cross expanded from there.  https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-aapl-death-cross/   The Death Cross is a technical analysis pattern in the stock market that occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average.   Typically, the Death Cross involves the 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day moving average.  This pattern is considered bearish and may suggest a potential reversal of an uptrend, indicating that a stock or market might be entering a period of decline.  Reason two. Apple had a double top of $199.37 in December 2023 and $196.13 in January 2024. This is extremely significant.  A double top is an extremely bearish technical reversal pattern that forms after an asset reaches a high price two consecutive times with a moderate decline between the two highs.  It is confirmed once the asset's price falls below a support level equal to the low between the two prior highs.  The double top pattern is a bearish reversal pattern that can be observed at the top of an uptrend and signals an impending reversal.  The double top chart pattern resembles the letter “M”, due to the two equal highs.  A double top is a chart pattern that signals the end of an uptrend.   Therefore, when the market forms a double top, close out long positions (sell)before prices fall.   You can also take a short position (short sell) to profit from the market's decline or buy put options on the stock.   The double top pattern can be a very profitable and highly predictable price action pattern.Usually dramatic drops over the next 2 weeks to 2 months of the second peak price.  Reason three. Apple broke below its recent double bottom of $167.19 in September 2023 and $165.24 in October 2023.  In April 2024 Apple dropped to a $164 range over 3 days or from April 19 to 23,2024. The 48 to 68 million was not convincing or heavy enough to suggest that a major low had truly formed on Apple stock.  If it was one day,it would be okay. But for 3 consecutive days of $164 range trading is a bit much. Trouble in Apple paradise or further downside coming soon ?   Double Bottom breakdowns on charts are bearish patterns that mark a downside support break.  But you might say the breakdown was only $1.00 or less from last 6 months highs.   Reason four. Apple is below its 20 days moving average of $169.37. Where it has been much of the last 3 months. Apple stock current price is  $169.30  Reason five. Apple hit another double top formation recently. Hit $178.67 in March 2024 and $178.36 in April 2024. And more worrisome,it broke the neckline of $167 per share in April 2024. Very bad.  Reason six. Apple’s market share declines in China by 25% year over year according to Canalys Report.  Apple declined the most among the top five, with 10.0 million units, a year-on-year decrease of 25%. Canalys Senior Analyst Toby Zhu commented. Pronounced downtrend. Not a good trend.  iPhone sales spiral 25% in China as Apple drops from first place to fifth. April 26,2024  According to Canalys, Apple saw its shipments in China hit 10 million units in Q1 2024, a decrease of 25% year-over-year.   This gives Apple a 15% share of the Chinese smartphone market, down from the 20% share it held at the same time last year.   https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/26/iphone-shipments-china-q1-2024-decline/  https://canalys.com/newsroom/china-smartphone-market-Q1-2024  With the continued expansion of the HarmonyOS ecosystem, Huawei emerges as the third OS for smartphones and other edge computing devices, breaking the two-horse race of Android and iOS in Mainland China.That is a big deal.  Apple is expanding its manufacturing outside of China. Definitely a good thing.  But can the India manufacturing and sales help overcome the 25% China drop in units or iPhones.  Here is a sign of things to come for Apple stock.  For years, eight words were stamped on the back of every iPhone: “Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China.” The slogan illustrated the tech giant’s two power bases: its headquarters in Silicon Valley and the manufacturing giant it had become in the factory of the world.  Apple no longer lists the words on the back of the iPhone. When the company launched a new supplier transparency website earlier this month, the phrase was updated: “Designed by Apple in California. Made by people everywhere.”  Reason seven.  Expected EPS for May 2,2024 is  $1.51  The latest earnings whisper is $1.50  Expected revenue for May 2,2024 is $90.61 billion.  The latest revenue whisper is $89.79 billion.   How can Apple meet these earnings and revenue with the huge 25% drops in units in China in its most recent quarter,  Make the revenue shortfall from India and Europe.  According to revenue and earnings whispers,Apple will barely be under expected earnings and revenue.  Based on this, Apple should drop on earnings date.  Unless Apple gives strong guidance regarding AI or Artificial Intelligence during the earnings call.  But what about Apple Watch sales. And Vision Pro sales. Plus the iCar exit.  Reason eight. Apple Vision Pro sales tank.  According to prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple has revised its Apple Vision Pro shipment expectations for 2024 down to 400,000 to 450,000 units.  Apple originally expected to sell as many as 800,000 Apple Vision Pro units this year, reports Kuo, who has accurately broken news on the company over the years due to his supply chain contacts.  The Apple Vision Pro is undoubtedly a flop as of April 2024.When is the last time you heard anything good about it in the news.Disappeared like lightning.  Will the “iCar” Exit Impact Apple Stock.  Why Apple scrapped its autonomous vehicle (AV) project, while iPhone earnings could be a bigger concern. April 12,2024  https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/248065/will-the-%E2%80%9Cicar%E2%80%9D-exit-impact-apple-stock.aspx  Apple Watch X: The latest on Apple’s plans for a major design refresh April 24,2024  https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/24/apple-watch-x-design-overhaul/    Are you bearish or bullish on Apple  stock. Could a steep drop after earnings begin bigger drops in the SP500 index or SPY ETF.  Reason nine.  Jim Cramer is bearish on Apple stock.  Jim Cramer said on April 22,2024 or on Cramer’s Mad Dash that Apple could hit $160 after earnings report on May 2,2024.  That is a huge $9 drop from current April 26,2024 levels of $169 per share.   Despite all these nine negatives, the options market is extremely bullish for May 2,2024.  The put call open interest ratio is decidedly bullish at 0.57 for the May 3,2024 contracts.  A falling put-call ratio, or below 0.7 and approaching 0.5, is considered a bullish indicator  For May 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.17 to 0.66 Very bullish.  For June 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.32 to 0.72  Definitely bullish.  The average investor thinks Apple is headed in the wrong direction. Maximum pessimism.  Morgan Stanley likes Apple stock.  But even suggest that there will be post-earnings weakness and that Apple will significantly lower guidance or a 4 to 7% drop for next quarter.  Buy the dip on tech stocks like Apple and Nvidia ahead of earnings, Morgan Stanley says.  We believe Apple will slightly beat March 2024 Quarter ests, but guide to June Quarter revs/implied EPS 4-7% below Street.   At $165, this appears priced in but in today’s volatile market, it’s a tricky setup.   That said, with Apple’s biggest WWDC ever on June 10th, we’d buy post-earnings weakness. Remain OW: $210 PT.  If Apple drops on opening of May 3,2024 will SPY 1 day options bought on May 2,2024 be a smart play for the next day. Hint.  In other words,will the Apple stock drop trigger a 1% plus drop on the SPY ETF.Very likely.  What say you regards. Listen to the option investors or options money flow.  Or is Jim Cramer right on Apple.";"170";"2024-04-29T06:05:18"
"Inverse Jim Cramer on Apple stock.Bullish then it is.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cib06w/inverse_jim_cramer_on_apple_stockbullish_then_it/";"Bernstein says ‘be like Buffett’ and buy Apple shares while they are cheap, upgrades to outperform April 29,2024  https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/29/bernstein-says-be-like-buffett-and-buy-apple-shares-while-they-are-cheap-upgrades-to-outperform-.html  Bernstein upgraded shares of Apple on Monday, saying they had fallen too far on fears of sluggish iPhone 15 sales and overall weak revenue in China.   The firm, which has been on the sidelines for Apple with just a market perform rating for more than two years, advised investors to “be like Buffett” and scoop up the shares while they are cheap.  Bernstein upgraded Apple to outperform from market perform and kept its $195 price target, representing 15% upside from here.   The stock is down 12% this year, compared to a 6.9% gain for the S&P 500, over fears that it is losing market share in China amid further restrictions by the government there.  Bernstein notes that following this year’s losses, Apple is trading at a price to earnings ratio of 26.4 based on its 2024 earnings estimate and just 22.9 times its 2025 estimate. Bernstein displayed a table in the note to clients that shows Buffett tends to trim the shares when its price to earnings ratio gets above 30 and he buys more during quarters when the valuation is around the current range.  We believe prevailing weakness in China is more cyclical than structural, and note that historically Apple’s China business has exhibited much higher volatility than Apple overall, given its very feature-sensitive installed base,” stated the analyst.   “We further believe that replacement cycle tailwinds and incremental generative AI features set up Apple well for a strong iPhone 16 cycle  Calling it very bullish.

Calls it is ?  The decrease in China sales is already priced in the stock. So even if they mention a decline in China sales the stock could still bounce if guidance and earnings are good.  Narrow earnings beat, moderate to strong guidance because of the iPad refresh coming shortly after. Artificial Intelligence will be mentioned.  It’s all about the guidance .  Unlikely to rocket but +3-5% seems reasonable barring a surprise.";"48";"2024-05-02T11:04:55"

"Whistleblower Alert: Goldman Sachs and the Apple Card Post-Bankruptcy";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1betnt1/whistleblower_alert_goldman_sachs_and_the_apple/";"Hey Wall Street vets,  I've got a tale that might pique your interest, especially if you're into the nitty-gritty of corporate conduct and potential market implications. Here’s the skinny:  After declaring bankruptcy in 2020 and having my debts, including an Apple Card balance of around $1200, legally wiped clean, I recently tried reapplying for the Apple Card to rebuild credit and finance some new tech. Surprisingly, I was told my account, with its previous balance, was still active. Multiple calls, promises of callbacks that never happened, and frustrating rounds with customer service later, I was informed that in Goldman Sachs' view, bankruptcy doesn't erase the debt: it just prevents them from collecting it. So, my account remains open with a balance they acknowledge they can't chase.  This doesn't just stop at being unable to clear the account or reapply for their services. It hints at something darker. I suspect Goldman Sachs might be keeping such noncollectable accounts active to inflate their asset sheets, showing significant debt holdings without disclosing their uncollectibility. This practice, if widespread, could mislead investors and regulators about the true financial health of the institution.  I'm now pushing legally to get my account accurately closed. If Goldman Sachs continues to obstruct, further actions will be considered. While I'm not in the stock game and am not here to give financial advice, this situation could be of interest to those who are. There's potential for significant market movement if these practices are proven and publicized.  Update: My attorney sent them a [""  cease-and-desist "" letter](https://imgur.com/a/sNJ6QrD) today. It's a vague generic letter obviously, but it starts the paper trail , if they continue to block my ability to even apply, i will be taking the next steps forward.  Second Update: Here's the law  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/524](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/524)  and here's a short description of how they're violating this law.  Apple Card, managed by Goldman Sachs, is potentially violating  bankruptcy law, specifically under 11 U.S.C. § 524(a)(2), by treating a  discharged debt as active. This law states that after a debt is  discharged in bankruptcy, creditors cannot attempt to collect on it. By  treating the discharged debt as open, Apple Card may be infringing on  the legal injunction against collecting discharged debts.  3rd Update: I've applied again just to see and record how it's processed on my end.  Here are the screenshots showing I have an Active and Open Account, and then prompts me to add my Active card to my wallet or manage the card... I consider this a violation of the law, an attempt to collect a debt by showing an active an open account with a balance.

"Time to Bet it All on Apple Earnings 🍎";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17m7yig/time_to_bet_it_all_on_apple_earnings/";"Gang, earnings saga continues and AAPL is stepping into the earnings today, after-hours. The Wall Street crystal ball is predicting a slight glow-up in earnings to $1.39 a share from last year's $1.29, despite expecting a tiny dip in revenue to $89.28B from $90.15B. That's about a 1% slip.  AAPL shares are showing off an impressive 32.5% gain this year, riding the high on dope tech and that globally-desired fruit logo. But even with those gains, analysts are side-eyeing AAPL's growth and are thirsty for those numbers to start climbing again.  We're all ears on the current quarter – it's the jolly season, so you know it's gotta be good, right? Apple hasn't offered official guidance since 2020, but their money man Maestri might drop some breadcrumbs for us. Hopefully.   **What I'll be paying attention to**  By far, the most important part of the Apple story is still the iPhone, their golden geese - bagging nearly half the sales last quarter even with a slight 2.4% drop to $39.67B. Apple launched new iPhones in September with a lighter, redesigned titanium body, a longer telephoto lens, and a USB-C charging port. So we’ll get our first insight into demand for the new 15's. AAPL's been hyping up their iPhone game, promising a sprint from last quarter with around 49 million of those shiny new toys shipped. While they haven't offered official revenue guidance in several quarters, I'll be looking to hear any directional guidance into year-over-year revenue growth in the iPhone, as well as any disclosures regarding sales at the end of September and into October. Per the latest [Canalys report on worldwide smartphone shipments](https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/worldwide-smartphone-market-Q3-2023), Apple’s market share was 17% in third-quarter 2023, lagging Samsung’s 20%.  Artificial intelligence remains a priority across technology earnings reports. I believe Apple will be keen to promote its AI advancements within existing products but will likely keep its future AI ambitions close to the vest. We need to further understand Apple’s AI efforts in more detail, and see how that might be a revenue driver in the future.   Services are the next leg of meaningful growth for Apple. I still view services as a bit of a lagging indicator, as many of these services are coupled with earlier purchases of Apple hardware. This still isn’t a bad thing, however, as these services create stickiness to the iOS ecosystem, which underpins Apple’s wide moat. In addition to iPhone revenue, I'll be interested to hear any commentary around services, particularly with some macroeconomic concerns and the financial health of consumers worldwide. Even as the Google trial in Washington DC highlights how much of that is from Google paying Apple to be the default search engine on iPhones, and puts that reportedly $19 billion per year deal at risk over antitrust. Apple is expected to report $21.42 billion in services revenue, offsetting some weak hardware revenue, and which would be an 11% year-over-year increase.  Now, Macs and iPads might not have everyone's attention this quarter, people are expecting to see a bit of a slump from last year's high. Apple's been straight-up about expecting a ""double-digit"" percent nosedive there, blaming difficult comparisons to a good quarter in 2022 when sales popped after prior supply issues. That's definitely not good. Apple executives could focus on the fact it just released new MacBooks with chips on Oct. 30 with new chips to stoke more interest?  The mood among analysts, especially in regard to expectations for the fourth quarter, is changing. [Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-woodring-3a739722/) says that there are four forces working against Apple in the December quarter: An unfavorable comparison, a strong dollar, iPhone supply issues, and a cautious consumer.  “Sentiment has turned more challenging for shares of Apple in recent days with increasing concerns around the lower demand for the iPhone 15 Series in China, as well as lackluster consumer spending momentum globally,” wrote [JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samik-chatterjee-94896518/) earlier this week in a note to investors.  **China**  One data point from a market research firm [tracking smartphone sales](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/18/apple-iphone-15-sales-look-like-theyre-starting-off-slow-in-china.html) suggested that iPhone 15 sales started off slow in China this year. Uh oh. I'm worried that renewed competition from Huawei in China could be making the iPhone less competitive in the company’s third-largest market. It could show up in Apple’s future guidance.  “Apple does have a China problem. I think when it comes to the phone, my sense is it’s going to be soft in China for the Sept. quarter,” [Deepwater Asset Management founder Gene Munster said earlier this week.](https://twitter.com/LastCallCNBC/status/1719140526497140978)  There’s some disagreement among analysts whether the Huawei competition is a temporary or permanent factor for Apple.  “Importantly, we believe the data suggests increased competition from Huawei in China is likely to be a headwind next year,” Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang wrote in a note last month.  But like, we all kinda know that the new premium Huawei device is pretty much technologically inferior.  “We expect Huawei-related pressure on iPhone to be temporary and moderate into FY24 due to significantly outdated chipset on the Mate 60 series,” he continued.  Throughout the quarter, buzz from the financial grapevine, specifically a piece from the Wall Street Journal, spotlighted China's play to ditch foreign tech within government walls. This move turned heads on Wall Street, sparking chatter about Apple's shifting stars in the East and fanning the flames over whether a surge in national pride or looming regulatory storms might have Chinese customers giving Apple the cold shoulder.  “With Huawei’s unexpected launch of Mate 60 Pro and Chinese government’s ban of using foreign phones for government workers, iPhone market share in China has been a big concern for investors,” wrote [Citi analyst A. Malik].  **Global iPhone Sales**  In other regions, investors want to know if the iPhone 15 is selling like hotcakes, or if it’s not moving off store shelves as fast as previous years. Analysts call the strength of any given year’s iPhone sales the “cycle.”  “We are in the camp that [iPhone 15] is not a good cycle on demand weakness and elongation of replacement cycles,” [Barclays analyst Tim Long](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-long-34b7481a/) wrote.  While analysts track ship times on Apple’s website and third-party estimates for iPhone sales, there’s no substitute for color from Apple CEO Tim Cook or sales numbers, either from the week or so the iPhone 15 was on sale in September or through its unofficial guidance for the December quarter.  Another factor is that some analysts are pointing to supply constraints on some iPhones, particularly the higher-end and more expensive “Pro” models which could push some sales out of the December quarter and into the January quarter.  “However, we are more cautious on the December quarter given iPhone supply shortages and uneven consumer spending, and believe Apple will guide to a revenue range that is both below normal seasonality and consensus expectations,” wrote Woodring, the Morgan Stanley guy mentioned earlier.  **Price targets?**  There are quite a few analysts who are long term bullish on the stock.   * [Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives](https://www.wedbush.com/analysts/daniel-ives/) reiterated an Outperform rating with a price target of $240 on Nov. 1, 2023.   * [Evercore Group analyst Amit Daryanani](https://www.evercore.com/bios/amit-daryanani/) reiterated an Outperform rating with a price target of $210 on Sept. 28, 2023.  * [UBS analyst David Vogt](https://stockanalysis.com/analysts/david-vogt/) reiterated a Neutral rating with a price target of $190 on Sept. 27, 2023.   But others not so much  * [BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wamsimohan/) reiterated a Neutral rating with a price target of $173 on Oct. 24, 2023. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 77%.  * [Barclays analyst Tim Long](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-long-34b7481a/) maintained an Equal-Weight rating and cut the price target from $167 to $166 on Oct. 30, 2023. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 70%.  All of these analysts are reported to have an accuracy of over 70%.   **What to do for Earnings**  I hate to say it, but given what I've read, it seems like Apple won't be doing too hot. That being said, it's tough to predict a direction when all the professional analysts are fairly 50/50 on the matter. I'm pretty sure last time I did an Apple play, I just got a straddle and ended up being 30% in the profit. However, historically, the company doesn't even move that much with earnings. We're looking at an average of 4.9%. I'd be lying if puts didn't look appealing right now. However, just as a lotto, I'm going to grab some AAPL 11/3 170p at about 80 bucks a pop. Keep in mind, like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too. Next week we have UBER, DDOG, RIVN, RBLX, AMC, DIS, PLUG and U.";"345";"2023-11-02T17:51:37"

The researchers conducted extensive experiments to identify the key factors driving performance in these models, testing different architectural choices and pre-training data mixtures.    Key points:  * MM1 includes both dense models up to 30B parameters and mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants * Image resolution has the biggest impact on performance, more than model size * Specific vision-language connector design has little effect * Mixing interleaved image+text, caption, and text-only data in pre-training is crucial * 5:5:1 ratio of caption, interleaved, and text data works best * Synthetic caption data helps for few-shot learning * The 30B dense model beats prior SOTA on VQA and captioning tasks  [https://aimodels.substack.com/p/apple-is-working-on-multimodal-ai?triedRedirect=true](https://aimodels.substack.com/p/apple-is-working-on-multimodal-ai?triedRedirect=true)";"373";"2024-03-18T02:39:04"

"Why I believe Apple's stock buybacks are misallocation of resources.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16xlfkr/why_i_believe_apples_stock_buybacks_are/";"Apple has one of the weirdest financial statements in the stock market, with PBR=45 and PER=30. This means the company’s yearly profit is greater than the equity it holds. In fact, despite being one of the most profitable company in the world, Apple’s equity has decreased from $140B (Dec. 2017) to $60B. Why? They’ve spent \~$90B on stock buyback and \~$10B on dividend per year (less before 2022). This is good if you are a short-term owner of the stock as the company is basically an ATM that gives back all of its profit to the shareholders. However, is this good in the long-term?   They are buying their stock back at PER of 30, which means 3.3% yield. The treasury yield is >4.5% and they are issuing new bonds at >5% ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-08/apple-tapping-us-high-grade-bond-market-for-debt-in-five-parts?embedded-checkout=true](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-08/apple-tapping-us-high-grade-bond-market-for-debt-in-five-parts?embedded-checkout=true)). So for their stock buyback to make sense, they need to show very good growth over next few years. However, the company has shown negative growth for nearly a year and I see much more obstacles to their growth such as: deglobalization, EU’s Digital Market Act, saturation of smartphone industry, not much presence in generative AI market. If they do not show significant growth, their resources should have been spent at 1) not rolling over debts at the high rates, 2) acquisitions, 3) R&D, 4) just dividends.   Because of these reasons, if I have to bet, I would bet their stock buyback will decrease next year. However, Apple has some upsides: low market share in many regions like India, increase in service charges (although this is what DMA seemed to be aimed against), some hidden project like Apple Car. However, I believe Apple’s main profit-maker (significantly greater margin on Iphone compared to other smartphones) is fully saturated and the company is at a junction where they need to spend their resources at making new revolutionary products and not at stock buybacks.";"512";"2023-10-02T05:03:20"
"APPLE AI/TECH GAME PLAN ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blxqdt/apple_aitech_game_plan/";"Hi, I want to know what you guys think about this idea on Apple. Let me know.   Apple has become one of the most successful companies of all time. They were the innovators of the past but and not really pushing the boundaries like NVDIA. This is a good thing for Apple and what I believe to be their plan.   1. Monopoly’s run shit in America. companies that have established themselves as economic powerhouses continue to take over and consume industries. It’s possible that Apple could be waiting to buy their way into the AI/TECH boom instead of trying to innovate further.   2. APPLE has a massive cash pile and it’s been  growing just as soon as the AI/TECH boom started. This allows Apple to have options when it comes to their next move in the industry.  3. Growing cash pile isn’t good for now. From what I’ve see a growing cash pile means the stock for Apple has underperformed. But as soon as we see Apple start to put that money to use which we have not seen yet it just allows investors stock up on shares.   4. Apple could simply buy their way into the industry and become a top dog again because they have enough money and resources to either buy a company that already has experience with the new age of tech. Or Apple could start to dump money into something new and impactful since they already have more than enough capital and resources to pull it off.  What’s my plan? I plan on waiting for that cash pile to keep stacking high and as soon as I see significant decreases I will dump money into shares and wait a year or buy leaps.  ";"55";"2024-03-23T18:29:58"

"Apple - Regardless of this Quarter: Now is the time";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ce31se/apple_regardless_of_this_quarter_now_is_the_time/";"Based on recent market activity I think this is a good entry point for Apple off the lows.  Here are all the reasons why not to like Apple right now  * Fall in phone sales especially in China * They have been absolutely sideways for the past 12 months and down \~9% for the year. * Things are going to look bad for this quarter that's a given. * Apple Vision is not selling well (give that thing a controller and games my god) * Regulators are breathing down their neck (I do feel some of it is justified regardless of what Cramer says) * It's been absent in this AI bonanza - probably their worst offense  However, with all of that said there is one thing that Apple has in its perpetual back pocket.  Install Base & Great Product recognition  Before I get into 2 companies that Apple will absolutely trounce, I want to talk about a prediction that is coming for their upcoming June developer conference.  Apple will 1000% announce their AI strategy. It is a foregone conclusion they will do this and in a meaningful way. If they don't do this it would be corporate malfeasance and Tim Cook should resign immediately. But why?  AI is something that YOU MUST get out the door and have people using it. It's not web search where you can make a deal with Google to use their AI offering. And BTW if you think that deal is going to happen with Google it 1000% is not. Apple would insane to do that. You have get your models up, trained and running. If you don't they can never improve. They can't get more training data. And, Apple is already reporting that they have models that are performing well.  ~~To pay Google or anyone for Models when Meta is just releasing models for free right now is a non-starter. Apple will make their own AI models.~~  Apparently not. Apple is now talking to OpenAI too. So Apple using Microsoft. lol hmmm. Interesting.  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true)  The fact that Apple isn't even look to compete with their own models is just wild to me.   As much as I wish Microsoft and or OpenAI would do a hardware device (regarding AI), Apple has the install base to do something meaningful and in a big way with consumers. Literally, this can be another vertical for Apple.  Other hardware, such as ""The PIN"" and ""the Rabbit"" are horrible devices. The Rabbit is OK but it is beyond obvious that your phone is going to be able to do what those devices do shortly. Literally, all Apple has to do is look at anything worthwhile on those devices, what's not worthwhile on them and come out with a future Iphone that does all that and more. It will be like taking candy from a baby.  Edge AI, in my opinion is going to be a great game changer and very practical use case for what profitable AI will look like. Whether it's a Robot or your HER / hand-held device edge AI is where this all goes.  Samsung has already begun AI on the phone and I don't really use it because of 1 reason. It's not a great foundational model like OpenAI's ChatGPT or anything good that is native on the phone. And this is the beautiful thing about Apple. If Apple can just be good enough with their AI models - They're opportunity is different than any other player in the mobile space. They can put a model that they make directly on the phone. True Edge AI. Nobody else has the opportunity to do that in the way Apple does. This will make the AI faster, more responsive, great computer vision, audio capabilities will all be native on the phone.  All for $20 / $30 a month that Apple sheep will be happy to pay for.  Look for Apple to begin that story this June.  My position: Currently I have 1 share but I think now is the time.";"48";"2024-04-27T04:00:49"

During the call in the same 2018, our famous CEO said that though Apple had sales problems in a few countries with high inflation rate (like Brazil and Russia), there were no such problems for China. But then, just a few days later, Apple decided to cut production and requested it from the suppliers, so I think it was obviously otherwise.  And just in two months Apple shocked everyone with its first announcement about the revenue cut since the iPhone establishment in 2007, causing AAPL to drop by 10% and resulting in 70B losses.  This was the reason of several big scandals and lawsuits based on the Cook's comments, but Apple denied that they had any wrongdoing in this case (and they continue to deny it to this day).

Apple's next generation of devices, and the iPhone in particular, could be breakthrough platforms for AI on the edge. Apple's lead in chip technology could put it at the forefront of a potential revolution in AI hardware. This would be the foundation for a unique ecosystem of AI apps for Apple devices.  The full text can be found [here](https://chaotropy.medium.com/apple-why-the-iphone-16-could-be-a-breakthrough-platform-for-ai-on-the-edge-33bb262033ef)  or [here](https://www.chaotropy.com/apple-why-the-iphone-16-could-be-a-breakthrough-platform-for-ai-on-the-edge/).      This is the author's opinion only, not financial advice, and is intended for entertainment purposes only. The author holds a beneficial long position in Apple Inc.   ""Apple still makes its money by selling end devices. So why should Apple watch its end devices become mere middlemen for its competitors' cloud-based AI solutions? As far as I know, there are no signs that Apple will suddenly enter the cloud AI race with Open AI's ChatGPT or Google Bard. I think Apple is planning something else, and there are the first concrete signs of it: starting with the iPhone, Apple's products could become platforms for running LLMs on the edge. In December 2023, Apple engineers published a [groundbreaking paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11514) showing that large LLMs can be run on the flash memory of an end device (such as an iPhone), bypassing the problem of limited DRAM on the edge. Flash memory has about an order of magnitude higher storage capacity than DRAM, making it possible to run even large LLMs on small end devices. Also in December 2023, Apple released its own open source AI framework, [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx), which is optimized for Apple's silicon chip architecture. App developers can already use it to write their own machine learning applications on Apple silicon. Earlier, in October 2023, Apple engineers unveiled their own [multimodal LLM Ferret](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07704v1), which has since been [released as open source](https://github.com/apple/ml-ferret) as well. Every new powerful open source LLM ultimately attacks the market position of commercial LLMs. With the M1-M3 generations, Apple has developed cutting-edge processor technology and has been a leading chip developer for years. For now, AI appears to be primarily a software revolution. Given the similar performance of OpenAI's GPT-3.5, xAI's Grok, the open source model Mixtral, and Google's Gemini Pro, as well as the reported similar performance of OpenAI's GPT 4.0 and Google's Gemini Ultra, there is already a suspicion that we are not so far away from the maximum possible performance of the new LLMs - some call it [Peak AI](https://www.businessinsider.com/generative-ai-chatgpt-getting-close-peak-2023-12?r=US&IR=T). Perhaps the next quantum leap in AI will be preceded by a revolution in computer chips - in which case Apple, as a leading chip designer, would suddenly be at the forefront. And when it comes to implementing and applying such AI models, let's not forget that Apple's devices are already packed with all kinds of sensors that generate a constant stream of data for locally executed AI.  So do we really want to believe that the world's most highly capitalized company is sleeping through the AI revolution and thinks it can continue to satisfy its customers with annual ""lackluster"" updates to high-priced devices? I doubt that Apple is simply relying on its product ecosystem to keep its customers. A new generation of iPhones and other devices capable of efficiently running AI on the edge would be the foundation for an ecosystem of new Apple and third-party apps that only Apple device owners would have access to - a Buffetian economic moat par excellence. Or, to quote the 2011 iPhone 4 advertising slogan, *If you don't have an iPhone, well you don't have an iPhone.""*";"91";"2024-01-07T10:19:12"

Apple’s stock is up over 51% so far in 2023, hitting all-time highs. I honestly see it as a safe haven with strong cash flow, even tho investors have been worrying about slowing demand for consumer goods, including PCs and smartphones. During the call, I'll want to hear about how the current quarter, which ends in September, is shaking out. Apple hasn’t given guidance since 2020, citing uncertainty, but they will provide us with some data points that they can use to determine whether Apple sees overall sales growing or shrinking. Wall street is expecting   * Revenue: $81.7 billion  > iPhone revenue: $40.2 billion  > iPad revenue: $6.4 billion  > Mac revenue: $6.3 billion  > Other products: $8.3 billion  > Services: $20.7 billion  * EPS: $1.19 per share  The company’s forecast will be more important. It may give clues as to whether global economies are set up for a “[soft landing](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/15/collective-embrace-of-soft-landing-economic-scenario-extends-2023-rally-after-welcome-drop-in-cpi.html)” after two years of interest rate hikes. The June period is typically Apple’s slowest quarter of the year, while its fourth fiscal quarter often captures back-to-school laptop spending, a few days of new iPhone model sales — which usually come out in September — and shows Apple’s momentum heading into the holiday season.  “What will matter most will be management’s September quarter,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst [Erik Woodring](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/erik-woodring) in July, adding that he expects Apple to guide to year-over-year revenue growth again.   I'm eager to see Apple give data points on India sales. Apple CEO Tim Cook traveled to the country in April and spoke about hopes for significant growth in the region. India became one of Apple’s top five iPhone markets during the quarter.  I don't know if people follow professional analyst notes, but [D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote this week,](https://dadavidson.com/Who-We-Serve/Equity-Capital-Markets/Our-Professionals/ECM-Profiles/ArticleID/1208/Tom-Forte-CFA) “On the call, we look for additional details on its expansion in India, including its retail and manufacturing presence.”   But Apple’s older growth driver, China, is likely to be closely watched as well. Greater China — including Hong Kong and Taiwan — is Apple’s third-largest sales region, and it has reported two straight quarters of revenue decline, even as the region reopened after years of strict Covid lockdowns.  “In our conversations, most investors feel that a soft China could pose a risk to the numbers and further commentary, but we feel that Apple’s position in China is on a solid footing and that the company is likely to see only a small if any decline in its iPhone sales,” wrote [Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar](https://www.pipersandler.com/about/people/harsh-kumar). Kumar said if China ends up being weak, it could be offset by strong sales momentum in India.  Apple mainly manufactures in China and investors will want to hear that the company has overcome many of the supply chain snags that have hampered sales over the past two years. If Apple stockpiled parts and has enough to make what it needs to produce, it could help margins.  Maybe people are tired of me tossing random names in the air, but a lot of these analysts are paid to do the heavy-hitting research, so it's only beneficial to read up on what they say. J.P. Morgan analyst [Samik Chatterjee](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/samik-chatterjee) thinks it is time to start viewing Apple in a new light, and I agree with this sentiment. Rather than seeing the tech giant as a product cycle company, it should be seen as a ‘resilient earnings compounder.’  “Apple’s diversified revenue drivers within Hardware, as well as the natural diversification of the replacement cycle for hardware product on account of a ~2 bn installed base of devices has moved the company incrementally away from being dependent on a product cycle relative to iPhones or any other hardware,” the analyst opined.  Moreover, the Services segment has grown significantly over time and is now well diversified in terms of its drivers, allowing it to achieve double-digit growth (excluding currency impact) even during challenging economic times. This “inherent diversification” positions the company next to other “’earnings compounders’ with resilient drivers.”  It also makes it easier to justify the premium multiple the stock has been trading at for the last six months, one which it is likely now to hold on to. Apple’s profitable services division includes monthly subscriptions such as Apple Music, warranties under AppleCare, fees from the App Store, advertising revenue from search licensing agreements with Google, payments from Apple Pay and other products. I'd like to see Apple’s services business grow regularly and smoothly, because the margins on services are so much higher than when Apple sells hardware. In particular, many analysts want to see services re-accelerate after a few quarters of weak growth because of lagging App Store software sales.  Apple suggested a 5.5% year-over-year increase in services](https://www.pymnts.com/apple/2023/apples-services-segment-slows-to-5-5-growth-rate/), and [FactSet’s](https://www.factset.com) estimates more than $20.7 billion in revenue. In fact, given the fact Apple is “well positioned to drive higher confidence from the upcoming earnings print as an ‘earnings compounder’ that continues to drive resilient performance,” Chatterjee thinks a new price target is due.  As for what to look out for in the report, Chatterjee expects the major highlight will be the pivot back to revenue growth on a year-over-year basis in F4Q23 (September quarter), boosted by “typical seasonality” in the majority of the business’ segments but with an additional kick from “moderating currency and improving Services growth rates as advertising rebounds.”  “The return to growth will mark Apple cycling past the most uncertain macro backdrop with resilient revenue and earnings, and well positioned to drive robust growth in a normal macro,” he said.  “For the Services business, we expect year-over-year revenue growth to accelerate from the +5% level expected in [fiscal third quarter,] with our checks suggesting online advertising has improved,” [Deutsche Bank analyst Sidney Ho](https://stockanalysis.com/analysts/sidney-ho/) wrote. But analysts will want to see Apple signal more growth than that.   We also need to keep in mind, Apple's AI acceleration. These analysts will also likely ask about artificial intelligence, given the industry wide obsession with the technology. There's also been a recent [Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/apple-preps-ajax-generative-ai-apple-gpt-to-rival-openai-and-google) that Apple is developing a ChatGPT-like AI model internally. Don’t expect Apple to gush about what it’s working on internally, though. “With the official intro of Vision Pro, we expect Apple’s updated comments on its AI aspirations to be a focus (albeit likely very high-level),” wrote [Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers.](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/aaron-rakers)  Apple reports its results by product line, which can give us a look into which businesses are thriving and which ones are in a down cycle. IPhone, iPad and Mac sales are all expected to be down on an annual basis, with iPad sales projected to drop nearly 11%. Wearables, the product category with headphones and Apple Watch — and what will likely be the reporting category for Vision Pro when it goes on sale — is projected to decline less than 1%. However, the experts expect Apple’s services business to grow 5.2% on an annual basis, which would be a bright spot for the report.  Given these details, I'm fairly sure AAPL calls will be the play today, but with high IV, I'm gonna grab a spread. I can buy the 8/4 192.5c for $300 and sell the 195c for $196. This means I can grab the spread for $104 each. Ideally, if AAPL were to go up just 1.8%, this means the spread can be sold at 140% profit.    **Amazon**  Okay, next is AMZN where analysts are predicting an earnings of $0.35 per share, significantly better than the loss of $0.200 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. In terms of sales, they anticipate an increase of 8.46% over the prior year quarter. For revenue, we expect them to report $131.49 billion. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts forecast a profit per share of $1.61. Data from [refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/en).  While revenue growth remains steady at Amazon, [it’s been stuck in the single digits](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/20/amazons-post-bezos-experiment-hasnt-gone-exactly-as-planned.html) for five out of the past six quarters. That trend is expected to continue, as analysts are looking for 8.5% growth in the second quarter and a number just slightly higher in the third period.  I believe Amazon’s expanding Amazon Web Services (AWS) will have a large impact on its second-quarter performance. Amazon Web Services has been a growth driver for years, but the pace of expansion is slowing as customers clamp down on spending due to an uncertain economic outlook. In the first quarter, AWS sales increased roughly 16%, the slowest growth since 2015, when Amazon began breaking out cloud revenue.   In the second quarter, AWS made its purpose-built security data lake, called Amazon Security Lake, generally available. The service aids in the simplification of compliance monitoring and security data management across hybrid and multi-cloud environments by centralizing an organization’s security data across AWS environments. It introduced a new configuration for Amazon Aurora, namely Amazon Aurora I/O-Optimized, which provides improved price performance and predictable pricing for I/O-intensive applications. It unveiled three new capabilities for its threat detection service called Amazon GuardDuty - GuardDuty EKS Runtime Monitoring, GuardDuty RDS Protection and GuardDuty Lambda Protection. AWS also announced the general availability of its no-code service, called AppFabric. I expect all these initiatives to have helped Amazon win customers. This, in turn, is expected to have boosted AWS’s second-quarter revenues, whose consensus mark stands at $21.49 billion, up 8.9% from the year-ago reported figure.  However, Brian Olsavsky (Amazon’s finance chief) warned in April that the company expects to see more of the same in the second quarter in cloud. In addition to cloud, profit margins will be an area of emphasis for investors, as well as artificial intelligence, a focus for companies across the sector.  “The key question will be whether management suggests that with the timing of the optimization cycle, AI workloads, and easing comps that AWS is likely to start showing revenue growth acceleration beginning in Q3,” analysts at [Evercore](https://www.evercore.com), who have the equivalent of a buy rating on Amazon, wrote in a note this week. “We don’t know.”  AWS rivals Microsoft and Alphabet last week reported solid results in their cloud businesses, beating analysts’ revenue expectations. But both companies said they continue to see organizations moderating their cloud spend.   Last week, Amazon hosted an AWS Summit, where the company announced updates related to generative AI, including a service that uses the technology to transcribe and summarize doctors’ patient visits. Amazon’s results will give investors a sense of whether the company’s ongoing cost-cutting efforts are beginning to bear fruit. Evercore analysts said they expect to see improving margins in Amazon’s retail business in the second quarter, as “comps against ’22′s massive cost spikes, capacity utilization recovers, and newfound efficiencies from the regionalization of Amazon’s retail operations kick in.”  Recent data released by the company showed improving delivery speeds and efficiencies in Amazon’s fulfillment network. The company said it’s made significant headway on its efforts to establish one- and same-day delivery as the standard for Prime members, while also bringing costs down. Also during the quarter, Amazon hosted its annual Prime Day discount bonanza, which they claim as its “biggest ever.” Amazon’s guidance for the third quarter could give a glimpse into how much Prime Day lifted sales.  Amazon’s advertising business is becoming increasingly important to the company’s financials. Several industry surveys have indicated a slow rebound in the digital ad market may be underway. Meta showed better-than-expected results last week, but rival Snap fell short of sales expectations and gave a weak forecast for the current quarter.  With Amazon's earnings, it's certainly a toss up. But I'm learning bullish. I'm gonna go ahead and do another call spread, getting AMZN 130c at $380 a pop, and selling the 135c at $195 each. This means I can grab the spread for $185 each. If AMZN were to go up with earnings, just 4.8%, this play will profit 170%.   **Coinbase**  Last and certainly least, there's Coinbase. I don't know if anyone rememebers but the SEC [sued the crypto exchange](https://blockworks.co/news/sec-sues-coinbase) not too long ago. The lawsuit is in regards to them allegedly operating as an unregistered exchange.   At today's earnings, investors are gonna be listening to hear about trading volumes and adjusted EBITDA. Coinbase improved its net loss from $557 million during the fourth quarter of last year to $79 million in the first three months of 2023. The exchange generated $284 million in adjusted EBITDA — earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — last quarter compared to a $124 million loss in the prior quarter.   “Unlike last quarter [when] we saw potential upside going into the print, this quarter is the opposite,” said [Owen Lau](https://sps.columbia.edu/faculty/owen-lau), an executive director at Oppenheimer and Co. Lau mentioned that he estimates Coinbase’s trading volume will have fallen 34% quarter over quarter — from $145 billion to $91 billion. The exchange’s adjusted EBITDA could fall about 90% to $29 million, he added.  [Mark Palmer](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/mark-palmer), an analyst for Berenberg Capital Markets, said the [Ripple ruling](https://blockworks.co/news/xrp-ruling-sec) and the prospects of a spot [bitcoin ETF](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/03/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-application-refiled-naming-coinbase-as-surveillance-sharing-partner/) approval have given some investors “a false sense of confidence” about Coinbase’s prospects.  In addition to weak transaction volumes, Coinbase’s results are likely to reflect lower interest income from USD Coin (the digital stablecoin). The exchange, which [introduced the stablecoin](https://www.coinbase.com/) with payments company Circle in 2018, offers users rewards by holding USD Coin on Coinbase.  Interest income rose to about $240 million during the first quarter, up from $182 million during the prior quarter. Of that $240 million, $199 million was USD Coin, Coinbase said in its Q1 shareholder letter. But USD Coin’s market capitalization has fallen by more than 50% over the past year.  “We see no reason why Coinbase’s guidance for the balance of the year should be particularly encouraging,” Palmer said. “While interest income on USD Coin has been a tailwind for Coinbase since interest rates started to rise, the continued decline in the stablecoin’s market cap raises real questions about the extent to which that income will support its operating performance going forward.”  Morningstar Analyst [Michael Miller](https://www.morningstar.com/authors/2412/michael-miller) said he will be paying particular attention to Coinbase’s expenses and non-trading revenue sources. So will I. The exchange’s operating expenses fell to $896 million in the first three months of 2023, a 24% drop from the previous quarter. The figure represented its lowest level of expenses since the first quarter of 2021.   “Coinbase has signaled that it’s pulling back on its investment spending during weak cryptocurrency markets and what it chooses to continue to invest in will indicate what it sees as priorities,” Miller mentioned.   Still, Coinbase said in its May shareholder letter that it expected second quarter expenses to increase due in part to higher legal expenses. Miller said he is also keeping an eye on any momentum Coinbase reports related to reducing its reliance on transaction fees.   Coinbase’s so-called subscription and services revenue, the bulk of which was interest income last quarter, also includes blockchain rewards from staking and custodial fee revenue. Combined, the category brought in about $362 million last quarter, compared to $375 million of transaction revenue.     “Coinbase being selected to provide custodial and surveillance services for a potential Blackrock ETF is a win on this front,” he said. “But it remains to be seen how much subscription and service growth Coinbase can create outside of interest income, which is now facing major headwinds.”   Guidance around the road forward as Coinbase deals with the SEC’s lawsuit could be helpful as well. The SEC has said it would oppose any motion brought by Coinbase seeking to dismiss the commission’s lawsuit. Honestly, any update related to Coinbase’s regulatory issues would very interesting but I’m not really expecting anything material to come out with earnings.  As a result of my research, I'm just gonna go ahead and get puts. COIN 8/4 90p is $420, and the 85p is trading at $242. Which means I can get a put spread for $178. Like the previous plays, I'm buying the more expensive contract, and selling the cheaper one as a hedge. If the stock were to drop 7.1%, this spread will profit 181%.";"67";"2023-08-03T21:33:44"

"Apple's new iPhone 15 sees start of production in India";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/15slcja/apples_new_iphone_15_sees_start_of_production_in/";"   Foxconn Technology (OTCPK:FXCOF) is starting production of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) new iPhone 15 at a facility in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, and aims to deliver the phones only weeks after they begin shipping from factories in China, Bloomberg News reported citing people with knowledge of the matter.  The tech giant aims to narrow the gap between its India operations and main production base in China. The companies plan to rapidly increase the volume of new iPhones coming from India.  Apple is on a multiyear project to branch out its production away from China, de-risking the supply chain for its vital products as tensions between the U.S. and China make trade less predictable. Meanwhile, India is seeking to have closer ties with the U.S. and make the country a manufacturing hub.  Before the iPhone 14, India output was behind China by six to nine months. However, this delay was reduced last year, and Apple made 7% of its iPhones in India at the end of March. This year, the company aims to move closer to level on shipment timing from India and China, but suppliers are not certain they will attain it, the report added citing the sources.  The capacity of India manufacturing for the iPhone 15 will depend on the availability of components, which are mostly imported, and the ramp-up of production lines at Foxconn's — formally known as Hon Hai Precision (OTCPK:HNHAF) (OTCPK:HNHPF) — Sriperumbudur plant, near the city of Chennai.

Faces Steep Decline in Stock Price as Q4 Sales Projections Wane";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1756djg/apple_inc_faces_steep_decline_in_stock_price_as/";"In a surprising turn of events for tech giant Apple Inc., the company's stock price is poised for a significant downturn in the final quarter of 2023.  The just broke it’s 4 days winning streak and the volume is much lower than normal. Numerous indicators, including a decline in projected sales and worrisome economic factors, suggest a challenging period ahead for one of the world's most valuable companies.  The Google search engine lawsuit also weighs heavily on the company and it can cause a significant earnings drop if the arrangement was to be cancelled. Apple has not yet launched any major AI enabled capability and the sales volume for the newly launched IPhone 15 look dismal. Chinese customers are cautious and the recent ban on government officials carrying iPhone is also causing a dip in the demand.  Apple's Q4 2023 sales projections have fallen short of expectations, sending ripples throughout the financial markets. Analysts, who previously anticipated a robust quarter, have revised their forecasts downward, citing multiple factors contributing to the decline.  The latest sales figures show a dip in iPhone sales, a critical source of revenue for the company, primarily due to market saturation and consumers holding onto their devices for longer periods. Moreover, supply chain issues have constrained product availability, resulting in delayed launches and unfulfilled demand.  Several economic factors are also contributing to Apple's woes. A recent hike in interest rates by the Federal Reserve has tightened consumer spending, impacting the purchasing power of prospective Apple customers. Rising inflation has made Apple's premium products less affordable for consumers, creating a headwind for sales.  Furthermore, global economic uncertainty and ongoing trade disputes have disrupted the company's international market operations. Supply chain disruptions caused by geopolitical tensions have driven up production costs, further pressuring Apple's margins.  As of October 11, 2023, Apple's stock (AAPL) is trading at $178.39 per share, a significant drop from its 52-week high of $198.23. The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio has contracted to 29.98, indicating that investors are becoming increasingly cautious about the company's future growth prospects. The company's market capitalization now stands at $2.79 trillion.  Looking at technical indicators, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has crossed below the signal line, traditionally considered a bearish sign, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing oversold territory, suggesting that the stock may be undervalued or experiencing strong selling pressure.  Investor sentiment is undoubtedly shifting. While Apple has long been considered a safe haven for investors, a growing number of shareholders are expressing concerns about the company's ability to sustain its historic growth rate. The sentiment is reflected in the significant increase in short interest over the past month, as more investors bet on the stock's decline.  Apple Inc. finds itself at a critical juncture, facing a multitude of challenges that are impacting its sales and stock price. With declining sales projections, economic headwinds, and a changing investor sentiment, the company's stock price is likely to experience a sharp decline in the coming quarters. Apple's ability to adapt and navigate these challenges will be closely watched by investors and market analysts worldwide.";"29";"2023-10-11T07:20:06"

The company said the new mental health features allow users to log their momentary emotions and daily moods, see valuable insights, and access evaluations and resources.  The iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch offer new vision health features which encourage healthy behaviors to reduce the risk of myopia (nearsightedness), and the Health app has come to iPad, according to the company.  Apple noted that new features and existing health features are based in science and built with privacy at the core.  **Mental Health:**  In the Health app people can scroll through engaging, multidimensional shapes and choose how they are feeling in a range from Very Pleasant to Very Unpleasant. Then, they can select associations which are having the biggest impact on their feelings, such as Travel or Family, and describe their feelings, like Grateful or Worried, the company added.  Users can see insights to identify what may be contributing to their state of mind — if it's associations or lifestyle factors, such as sleep or exercise — and can use this to better manage their health, Apple noted.  **Vision Health:**  Apple said that with watch OS 10, Apple Watch launched the ability to measure time spent in daylight using the ambient light sensor.  Users can view the amount of time spent in daylight detected by their Apple Watch in the Health app in iOS 17 and iPad OS 17.  Apple said the new Screen Distance feature uses the same TrueDepth camera which powers Face ID on iPhone and iPad to encourage users to move their device farther away after holding it closer than 12 inches for a longer time.  Children who do not have their own phone, can use Family Setup to pair the Apple Watch to their parent's iPhone, which will give the guardians visibility into the amount of time the kids are spending in daylight with Health Sharing  Additional Updates: With iOS 17, iPad OS 17, and watch OS 10, the Medications feature provides users the option to receive follow-up reminders if they have not logged taking a scheduled medicine.  The new Journal app on iOS 17 allows users to writing about and remembering life's moments. The app uses new Journaling Suggestions API to offer a personalized set of moments to write about, using on-device machine learning.

"Time to sell: Apple's Wonderlust Event: Tim Cook's 180-Degree Jump On Hold";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16g4ei1/time_to_sell_apples_wonderlust_event_tim_cooks/";"Apple's Wonderlust Event: Tim Cook's 180-Degree Jump On Hold  Inside sources at Apple have revealed that Tim Cook, Apple's revered CEO, had a jaw-dropping 180-degree jump planned for the upcoming Wonderlust event. This was where the iPhone 15 was poised for its grand unveiling. The idea was for Cook to leap into the air, execute a twist, and land facing the opposite direction. This ambitious sequence was to be captured by a camera which would transition seamlessly, ensuring the audience would never see Cook's back.  However, these plans might have to be shelved as Cook is currently grappling with ankle issues. With the event fast approaching, insiders hope for his timely recovery, as this jump has been something he's been planning for the better part of a year.  Those familiar with Apple's history know that Steve Jobs, Apple's late co-founder, had an undeniable charisma on stage. Cook, having always held deep admiration for Jobs' theatrical prowess, saw this jump as an opportunity to take a leap forward in his stage presence. This theatrical flourish wasn't just for the spectacle, but to symbolize Apple's radical shift in direction, especially with the introduction of the UCB-C port.  But for Cook, and indeed for Apple, the larger picture always takes precedence. Health is paramount, and taking risks, especially physical ones, might not be worth the price, no matter how impactful the intended message.  There's still some hope that Cook might compromise with a 90-degree turn instead, which, while less dramatic, still conveys the message of a change in direction. Fans and analysts are watching closely, with many sending well wishes for Cook's speedy recovery.  As the Wonderlust event approaches, the tech world is abuzz not just about the new iPhone 15 and its features, but also about Cook's potential stage antics. Whether he jumps or not, it's clear that Apple's CEO knows how to keep the world on its toes. Whatever happens, Apple's upcoming event promises to be memorable in more ways than one.";"23";"2023-09-11T21:18:36"
"Apple Plans New iPad Pro for May as Production Ramps Up Overseas";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bq2p5k/apple_plans_new_ipad_pro_for_may_as_production/";"Apple Inc.’s overseas suppliers have ramped up production of the company’s long-anticipated new iPads and a launch is planned for early May, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  The release will center on revamped versions of the iPad Pro and iPad Air, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren’t public. As Bloomberg News has previously reported, the Pro models will get crisper new OLED displays — short for organic light-emitting diode — while the iPad Air will get a 12.9-inch screen option for the first time.  The move marks an end to the longest stretch without new models in the history of the iPad, which was first introduced by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in 2010. It’s been about 18 months since the last updates — a drought that’s contributed to already-sluggish demand for tablets. Apple is betting that the new models, with faster chips and revamped accessories, can help spur a renaissance for the category.  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-28/when-is-the-new-ipad-pro-ipad-air-coming-out-apple-plans-early-may-launch?srnd=homepage-americas";"1";"2024-03-28T19:23:43"
"Supreme Court rules in Apple's favor in Epic Games appeal";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/15mz8xg/supreme_court_rules_in_apples_favor_in_epic_games/";" In the ongoing legal battle between Epic Games and Apple, the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of Apple, allowing the tech giant to maintain its App Store payment rules for now. This decision is a temporary win for Apple, as the lawsuit continues to unfold.  Currently, companies selling apps on the App Store are charged a percentage of the sale price (15% to 30%) for using the platform. Epic, along with others like Spotify, claimed this practice was unfair.  While Apple largely won the suit and wasn't found guilty of anticompetitive behavior, the judge did mandate that Apple's anti-steering rules be lifted. **This meant that companies should be allowed to guide users to their own sites for purchases or subscriptions, potentially offering lower prices than on the App Store.** The Ninth Circuit upheld this ruling but paused its implementation, allowing Apple to appeal to the Supreme Court.  The recent win for Apple results from the Supreme Court's decision not to expedite the implementation of the anti-steering rules. Justice Kagan rejected Epic's plea to have the rules enforced immediately, granting Apple more time. This victory isn't definitive, though, as the legal battle is far from over.  **The implications of this case are significant. Beyond the US, the EU is also pressuring Apple to revise its App Store rules to allow third-party developers to offer alternative payment methods. The outcome could impact not only Apple's App Store revenue but also set a precedent for other video game companies to offer alternate purchasing options, potentially affecting Apple's bottom line.**  In conclusion, while Apple has scored a small victory in the ongoing legal saga with Epic Games, the larger implications and potential changes to App Store rules are still to be determined. The battle is far from its final stages, and its outcome could have far-reaching consequences for the app and gaming industry.  **Summarized by CHATGPT, Siri's 100000x better version.**   Source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/video/supreme-court-rules-apples-favor-195542494.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/supreme-court-rules-apples-favor-195542494.html)  &#x200B:";"36";"2023-08-10T04:18:03"
"Apple Car Q&A With Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. What Questions Do You Have?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1b9w558/apple_car_qa_with_bloombergs_mark_gurman_what/";"Hi everyone!  Bloomberg News Apple reporter Mark Gurman is hosting a live Q&A about Apple’s failed electric car effort -- and what’s next for the company. You can tune in on Monday, 3/11, at 2pm ET. If you have questions for Mark, drop them in the comments and we’ll do our best to make sure they get answered during our live conversation next week.  We also have an email you can send questions to for a more detailed response -- that’s [bloombergqa@bloomberg.net](mailto:bloombergqa@bloomberg.net).  TLDR on the Apple Car: Apple believed that it could create a better car than Tesla and the rest of the automotive industry ultimately led to the downfall of the project. The company had looked at pricing vehicles at $100,000 apiece, meaning it wouldn’t take long for the company to have a multibillion-dollar moneymaker on its hands (even if those sales didn’t translate to big profits). But according to someone involved in the decision making, it was as if Apple had tried to skip all the early iPhone models and jump right to the iPhone X. The company also had sunk billions of dollars into developing a Level 5 self-driving system — the highest level of autonomy. The end of the car project means CEO Tim Cook has one fewer breakthrough to hang his hat on as Steve Jobs’ successor.

This seems like a symmetrical triangle. Does this look bearish moving forward? The highs are relatively close, and the lows still haven’t met the initial Monday low. The bot keeps removing my post if I put a picture of the chart. Simply put:  Monday: 174 High 169.95 low.  Tuesday 173.6 high 171.4 Low Wednesday ??

They’ll be releasing all of their new software, iOS 17, iPadOS 17, macOS 14, watchOS 10 and tvOS 17. But no one cares about that stuff, we’re all here to see if the new “Reality Pro” headset (which is the rumoured name) will be a turning point in how we view AR/VR.   There have been reports suggesting that the upcoming headset could resemble ski goggles, featuring 8K displays, multiple cameras, and an external battery pack. It is rumoured to come with a price exceeding $3,000 (ouch).   This launch is highly anticipated as Apple ventures beyond the iPhone and explores a new realm of wearable devices. It is expected to bring forth a fresh platform of apps and services specifically designed to provide users with an immersive experience. Should Apple release its headset, a significant aspect of the unveiling would likely revolve around the speculated xrOS (extended reality OS). Apple is anticipated to provide an overview of the primary functionalities, developer resources, and approaches for this operating system, which is believed to emphasize entertainment and communication.  In summary, the rumored Apple headset and potential xrOS introduction could signify a major milestone for the company, venturing beyond the iPhone into immersive experiences. While details remain unclear, the anticipation surrounding these developments is palpable, promising exciting possibilities for developers and users.

While I know that Apple completely acquiring DIS is out of the question, but the launch of the vision pro gives apple a huge opportunity in the entertainment sector. I can see a huge upside for both companies if Apple and Disney reach some sort of deal with Disney’s media portfolio and Apple TV+ to leverage the new headset. Since Disney is so down bad, I think it would make sense for Disney to be champing at the bit to enter some sort of symbiotic deal with Apple. Thoughts?";"0";"2023-06-12T15:21:16"
"WTF is going on? (AAPL)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16i6ur9/wtf_is_going_on_aapl/";"No seriously, it’s actually crazy how no one is talking about the fact that Apple is potentially in a highly dangerous position due to the Anti-Trust lawsuit against Google. You regards realize that this doesn’t just have implications for Google but will most likely seriously fuck up Apple too if the deal between them to default Google as a search engine is ruled as anticompetitive?  Apple nets $10-$20 BILLION a year just from setting Google as a default on devices and its browsers, and even if the district court doesn’t go nuclear and void the agreement, kneecapping Apple’s profits back to the stone age, it could demand that Apple pay out some or all of the money earned through that deal to competing search engines.   Sure guys, Apple will still be Apple, and the technocrats in the courts will continue to suck off corporations, but it’s not like there isn’t precedent for Antitrust even if it’s been a while since such a high profile case. MSFT 20 years ago, Google/Apple now, don’t be surprised and don’t say I didn’t tell you so.";"265";"2023-09-14T04:53:48"
