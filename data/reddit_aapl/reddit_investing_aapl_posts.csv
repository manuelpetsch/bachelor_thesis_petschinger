I've had it since November, 2017 and it's up about 270% from when I bought it. At it's highest my gain was about 300%. It's down ~11% this year.  It just seems a bit saturated. iPhone is getting shellacked in China. They've got a great ecosystem of products and loyal customer base with one of the strongest brands in the world, but it feels like growth is limited.  Just wanted to see what everyone thinks. I know it's never a bad thing to sell and claim profits, but I know I'd kick myself if it did well later on.   Also not sure where is a better place to park that money. I was thinking Netflix, it's been gangbusters recently, but the streaming market seems very iffy. I've got GOOG, NVDA, AMD, MA, V, MSFT, and META and not sure if I want to increase my exposure to any of those as well as they've done.   Would be interested in people's opinions on AAPL and what might be a better investment for anyone souring on the company.";"0";"2024-04-16T16:26:20"

On Friday, Apple stock was down 2% in premarket trading, as the tech giants gloomy results contributed to it's share price decline.      Revenue has slid for multiple quarters at the tech giant as Mac and iPad sales have flagged. On a call with analysts Apple CFO Luca Maestri said **the company expects revenue for these products to fall by double digits from last year**, citing pent-up demand from the prior year quarter after factory shutdowns.      Services did better however my big question is if this really can compensate if Apple's hardware sales keep slumping? Quite frankly i don't understand why people keep buying the same iphone every year or maybe they no longer do? It's time Apple steps up its iphone and other hardware innovation instead of just repackaging the same thing every year with minor-to-no updates.  PS. anybody else would wanna see a macbook (pro) **with touchscreen**? Personally i love my Dell XPS 13 4K with touchscreen and love the dimensions are only 30x20cm.

Instead, the wealth advisor continues to compare it's returns to that of a set of investments chosen by the wealth advisor as an alternative proving an above-market performance (i.e., in a seemingly straw man argument). Meanwhile, Vanguard funds seem to be way above this 6.76% return.   The friend is not looking to become rich and famous here.

My wife (28F) and I (35M) are going to be diversifying from apple and would love your opinions. I will give a brief background about us and also our financial situation.   My wife is finishing her masters program in the spring of 24 and will be making about 100k a year. She will have about 70k in student debt. I am in tech and earn about 175-250k with zero debt. We have 1 daughter who is 3 years old. We live in a HCOL area in Northern California and fortunately have a paid off residence.   The allocations below are held in a trust which took a 90k loss last year and gives us the opportunity to reduce allocation % in apple. Essentially we will be selling 90,000 in capital gains (roughly 690+ shares) and diversifying.   (Trust) Apple shares - 3,250 ($572,975) Shwab CD - $125,000 (4.1% & expiring in October 2023)  Cash - 14.5k  Personal brokerage  Apple shares - 620 ($109,306) Nvidia shares - 15 ($6,720 Tesla - 10 ($2,670) 529 account - ($4,000) VTI - $22,420 (Roth ira) 401k - $101,000 (VTSAX) Cash - 35k  Our Schwab advisor is pushing for a self directed index through Schwab. The Schwab advisor  wants us to harvest losses in the future so we can diversify apple to even out the allocations. Minimum investment amount is 100k into this self directed index fund. Our longLong term goal is wanting to have a 10-15% allocation in apple.   My question to the group is, what should my next step be? I’m a little skeptical about a self directed index fund because it’s a Schwab robo advisor with .4% fees. Should i just sell 75% of the entire trust and VTI or VOO it?

Sure many Americans may be poorer but there are a lot more Americans with higher paying jobs and cash, especially in the cities and suburbs on the coasts.   Apples stock price has barely dropped and still trades at a healthy $170 range. Apple and Microsoft make up the largest allocations of Spy and many many funds. People crying now are being ridiculous. The real pain won’t start until Apple is at least down in the $150 range and things will be in full swing around $120 range. Same thing goes when Microsoft is under $230.   When these two things happen, I think spy will drop to around $330-340 range. That will be the time to jump in with everything you have. I’ll be buying TLT also then hopefully around $45.

Despite their significant revenue, they have seen a decline in gross margin percentage, from 38.2% in 2017 to 37.6% in 2020. This could be indicative of increased production costs or decreased pricing power.   Furthermore, they have been spending heavily on share buybacks, with a total of $73.2 billion in 2020 alone. While this may boost earnings per share in the short term, it's also indicative of a potential lack of more productive investment opportunities.   In addition, while Apple's been investing in AI, they seem to be lagging behind competitors like Google and OpenAI. While they have made some acquisitions in the space, they have yet to make significant strides, which raises concerns about their ability to keep pace in this rapidly evolving field.

For example, Apple just authorized a 100 billion dollar buy back. In a vacuum, buying back stock lowers Apple's market cap, thus lowering its weight in an ETF like $SPY.  My question is, in theory, are ""buy backs"" bad or at least indifferent to passive Index ETFs? If my thinking is correct, dividends would be better for passive index ETF investors because the market cap weighting remains the same and the return of capital increases.  In practice, buy backs are probably a net positive because Apple went up almost 200 billion in market cap based on announcing a 100 billion buy back in their earnings release.

AI is clearly here now, and AR is maybe 5 years out before some VERY heavy investment. Right now the leaders are Meta and Apple.   Opinions:   Meta Case: Meta's headset makes you look like a cyborg, its very goofy looking compared to the Apple Vision Pro. It's also angled at gaming, which is problematic because none of the major gaming companies have committed to it, meaning until that occurs there is no guarantee that the gaming angle plays out. I imagine programming a VR game is SIGNIFICANTLY more intensive of an investment than required for an xbox game. That said META is not cannibalizing its own sales nearly as much as Apple...  &#x200B:  Apple Case: The vision pro looks much cleaner, as do almost all Apple products. Apple has the wearable tech that will help them make the headset much smaller over time. They are also angled towards business. I just watched the Vision Pro video and frankly it looks like a great product for three reasons: The clean look, the dimming of a room when watching TV/movies which enhances the experience and makes it more convenient. Finally, I think the environment one is very good. I can be doing my work on the vision pro ""literally"" surrounded by Mount Doom's lava and Frodo bringing the ring up to the mountain. The massive con is that the vision pro cannibalizes the iphone and the mac book. As the vision pro gains traction there is immediately less of an incentive for using the iphone and the mac book which make up a big piece of apple's sales.  &#x200B:  What are your thoughts? Right now, my money is in Meta, but after seeing Apple's product I think apple has gone the right direction. Meta is too reliant on the gaming industry and they haven't made it nearly as suitable for wearing it in social situations. No way you're wearing that headset around other people at a party.";"0";"2024-01-20T15:36:41"

Eg, if the fund owns 100 shares of apple, and I own 1 percent of the fund, then I own 1 share of apple. Of course in reality the ownership stake would be negligible.   Is this actually true? And do we not get voting rights in each underlying company due to just how many there are and how insane it would be to tally every single investors vote for every single company, in say the SP500. Or is it because we only own a partial stake in vanguard and it means nothing for the underlying companies they invest in? If someone had a larger, majority stake in a vanguard fund, would they have voting rights, or am I missing something?  Next question is about BlackRock. It's a public company. So if I invest in a BlackRock fund, who is the owner partially, of the underlying companies? Is it me indirectly through my stake in the fund, while the shareholders in BlackRock profit from the money BlackRock earns through charging me fees.

The underlying intrinsic value and performance of those equities will never be considered by the shareholders.  As many are quick to point out, most big cap stocks are currently heavily overpriced. For example, [Pepsi](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PEP?p=PEP) currently costs $38.67 per $1 of profit today.

"Stocks with more money in assets than market cap total?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17e0dzq/stocks_with_more_money_in_assets_than_market_cap/";"So I built a stock screener for myself that runs through a list of all companies on the NASDAQ and I noticed some (and by some I mean alot more than I imagined.)companies market cap is way below the total assets. Why is that? Wouldn’t the company be at least valued at the value of their total assets? I’m just curious because I heard on the money guys show on YouTube that one of them had a friend that noticed that Apple was trading in 2008 not much higher than the total of their assets. I figured it would be something interesting to look into and now I’m curious.  EDIT: Obviously Apple was a stable valuable company in 2008 as it is today. I’m just new to looking at balance sheets. I’m beginning I realize that I should subtract liabilities from the assets and re run the screener. As well as I did plan to do further DD before buying.";"12";"2023-10-22T20:54:37"

I‘m not sure how I feel about this. Before today, the Dow was the last of the 3 major U.S. large-cap indices with less (relatively speaking) concentration in tech. “Big Tech” now makes up 30% of the S&P 500 and even more of the NASDAQ-100.  The Dow Jones now includes 3 of the 6 companies (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon) usually considered as Big Tech, plus cloud software provider Salesforce, as well as 3 legacy tech companies (IBM, Intel, Cisco.)

As you know, the only risk that is relevant for purposes of estimating a cost of equity is market or ""risk that cannot be diversified away."" In that sense, a company-specific risk, in my opinion, can easily be diversified away.   Here's my question: if any risk that can be diversified away should not be considered as an additional risk premium, shouldn't we use a similar cost of capital when valuing Apple and a new-born startup? Because, startup has a company-specific risk like unforeseeable cash flows, but it is something non-systematic and can be diversified away. Right?   We of course don't use the same cost of capital because the startup is a riskier asset, but what I don't understand here, if we don't consider any additional risk premium for risks that can be diversified away, why don't we use a similar cost of capital for a startup with Apple, Amazon, etc...";"0";"2024-04-08T14:21:37"

"ExxonMobil passed Tesla as the most shorted stock last month. Here are the 10 names investors are betting against the most.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17rhwac/exxonmobil_passed_tesla_as_the_most_shorted_stock/";"ExxonMobil was the most shorted large-cap stock in the S&P 500 last month, according to HazelTree.   Tesla and Apple followed the energy giant in the large-cap sector, according to data from HazelTree.   Fund managers tracked by the firm also bet heavily against Rivian, SNAP, Ford, and AirBnB.  ExxonMobil Corp replaced Tesla as the most-shorted large-cap stock in the S&P 500, according to a report from HazelTree.      Before last month, Elon Musk's car company had held the top spot as the most shorted stock for four consecutive months. When investors short a stock, they are betting that a company's share price will decline.       HazelTree ranks short bets with a ""Crowdedness Score"" of one to 99, with the highest level representing shares shorted by the greatest percentage of funds tracked by HazleTree. The firm collects data on 12,000 global equities and over 700 funds.      In the large-cap group, ExxonMobil and Tesla led the way with scores of 99 and 97, respectively, followed by Apple (94), Charter Communications (91), Broadcom (91), Rivian Automotive (86), US Bank Corp (83), SNAP (83), Ford (78), and AirBnB (78).       The three most-shorted names in the mid-cap sector included SOFI Technologies (99), American Airlines (92), and EV maker Lucid (92).       The report also highlighted the percentage of institutional investors' supply of a particular stock to be loaned to short sellers. In order to short a stock, an investor betting against a particular name must borrow the shares. It then sells them immediately. If the share price fall as expected, the short seller buys the shares back and returns them to the lender and pockets the difference in price.       HazelTree said it tracks how ""hot"" a stock is in terms of supply and demand from short sellers.       Rivian Automotive led the way in institutional supply utilization at 37%, well above ExxonMobil's 3.13% and Tesla's 2.67%.       Exxon is down about 6% year-to-date, while Tesla has gained a whopping 76% this year but is dealing with headwinds stemming from uncertain demand for electric vehicles and stiff competition that has led to price cuts on its vehicles over the course of 2023.

I wanna invest into AI and cant decide whats the best call there. I think most will agree that the best bet for AI is to invest into the Big Companys: Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Meta, Google and Amazon. (Tesla not included because i dont like Elon tbh).     Investing into S&P Tech will give me big Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA but not the other companys. Investing into NASDAQ 100 will give me all of them, but with a lower Rate (can be good can be bad). And of course i just can buy those 6 Stocks.     I think Apple (even if they dont have LLMs yet) will be big in AI in 1-2 Years and the capability shipping local AI on all of their devices are insane.  Huge potential here + we talk about Apple. Microsoft is playing the AI game better than anyone else right now and coming GPT Versions will slap. I also like the new approach of Meta and with LLAMA there is also huge Potential. NVIDIA is of course also a no brainer (even if some ppl think they are overvalued), they are way ahead of other companys like AMD right now. Amazon while not having insane LLMs right now, has of course on of the best Sectors to apply AI in general.     With alphabet i have to say, im not so sure.

He has some basic principles that we should all use:  * Invest only in businesses you understand, with favorable long-term prospects, led by competent management, and at reasonable prices. * Look for a long-term competitive advantage in a stable industry. * Seek exceptional companies at reasonable prices, not mediocre companies at bargain prices.        The Risks I see:     * The company's past performance has been incredible, but its current size will inevitably slow down its performance.  * Warren Buffet is 93 years old. What is going to happen to BH when he die ? Even that seems ok: It's known that Howard Buffet will be the future Chairman and Greg Abel the future CEO when Warren is no longer around. Greg Abel shares the same basic principles of management and investment as Warren Buffett. * Lastly, Warren Buffet is not exposed to Green and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) topics.

"20 stocks till 2049 - buy and hold for 25 years";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19a10qn/20_stocks_till_2049_buy_and_hold_for_25_years/";"Hello. Apologies if this has already been posted in this community.   I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ.  https://archive.is/20231009181337/https://www.wsj.com/articles/picking-a-stock-for-the-year-2048-66d90e  The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.  So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold.   So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049.   Here is my list so far.   1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 ) 2. Costco 3. Johnson and Johnson 4. Waste Management 5. CVS 6. Home Depot 7. Boeing 8. Caterpillar 9. GE Aerospace 10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia 11. Walmart/Target 12. Starbucks / McDonalds 13. UPS 14. JP Morgan / Bank of America 15. Berkshire / Markel 16. Disney 17. Tesla / GM 18. Hershey 19. Dollar General 20. Lockheed Martin  Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate.   Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.  Edit: Some really good points in the comments.   1. Most of my regular investing goes to VOO. Think of this as a fun little experiment  2. Since all of these are mature large companies, maybe it makes more sense to go with mid cap stocks. In that case, what would you pick?";"131";"2024-01-18T22:13:00"

"Support - Understanding warrants";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/148ow9k/support_understanding_warrants/";"Hi. So I am a relatively new investor mainly in stocks and ETF's. Still I am trying to deepen my understanding of various instruments and was hoping you guys might help me out. I have been reading up on warrants I was hoping you guys might confirm my understanding or correct my misunderstanding :)  The online broker i am using has two types of warrants - Call and Put. Both have three characteristics 1) Strike price 2) delta 3) expiry date. Now my understanding is that by buying a call warrant i basicly buy the right to buy shares on a future date for a predefined price.   Examle: There are Calls on Apple shares. The strike price is USD 128 and the expiry date is 20.12.2024 and delta 0.81. So if i understand correctly by buying 1 warrant for EUR 7 I will have the opportunity to buy 1 Apple shate on 20.12.2024 for USD 128. The delta seems to be an indicator of the volatility of the Warrant.  I am pretty sure i am missing something as this sounds too good to be true. So basicly if i want to invest in Apple instead of investing USD 180 today in 1 Apple share, i could invest (buy) a warrant for EUR 7 with the same idea and if the share prices does increase i could excercise the warrant for USD 128 (USD 50 lower than the price if i buy a share to hold today). If the share price is lower than the strike price i wouldn't excercise the warrant while in the meantime i could have invested my money in other stocks.  I have a similar question for the put warrant but lets see first about the calls as I am pretty sure I am missing something";"0";"2023-06-13T22:32:44"
"Is NVDA really over valued long term?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aqamjq/is_nvda_really_over_valued_long_term/";"Title says it. If you’re looking to hold for 10-40 years is NVDA really overvalued? Let’s take Apple for example. On September 28, 2018, AAPL hit an all time high of $56.44. It was followed by a steep fall to high $30s in late 2018. Almost a 30% decline. I’m sure it hurt investors at the time. And I’m sure a lot of people were kicking themselves saying “I shouldn’t have bought at all time highs when it’s so overvalued.” However, if they held for about 5 years until today they’re probably thrilled to have bought for $56.44. I’d personally load the boat with AAPL these days. Sure their return isn’t as high as it could have been but timing the market is all but impossible. My point is, if you’re bullish on a company for strong reasons. The risk of overvaluation/draw down should not keep you sitting on the side lines. Time in the market beats timing the market. If you’re not bullish on NVDA please explain why?";"0";"2024-02-14T02:26:55"

"Roth IRA vs Cash vs Margin Accounts";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18oksy0/roth_ira_vs_cash_vs_margin_accounts/";"&#x200B:  &#x200B:  I'm trying to understand if my math (and logic) is correct when comparing gains on like-trades but in different account types. For reference, my investment amount will be $200,000 via TD Ameritrade/Charles Schwab, 15% tax rate, and 13.00% effective margin rate. 28 years old. Employed. Not married. No children.  &#x200B:  AAPL 2023 YTD performance is \~+55.25%. Past performance is not indicative of future results, I know. According to 1stock1, between 1981 and 2022, Apple has been positive 27 of those 42 years, with the strongest being +211.90% and the weakest being +5.42%. The average of the positive years is +67.8103704%. Apple has been negative 15 of those 42 years, with the worst being -71.06% and the least being -4.17%. The average of the negative years is -29.092%. 1995 to 1997 (3 years) was Apple's longest consecutive yearly losing streak. 2009 to 2014 (6 years) was Apple's longest consecutive yearly gain streak. The average of all 42 years is +33.202381%.  &#x200B:  Roth IRA contribution limit in 2024 is $7,000. Non-deductible. Tax-free at distribution in retirement. $7,000 + 30% = $9,100. Gain of $2,100  &#x200B:  Cash account of $7,000 + 30% = $9,100. Gain of $2,100 - 15% (tax) = Gain of $1,785  &#x200B:  I can see that in this example, the Roth IRA is the better choice as opposed to the cash account. However, the Roth IRA is limited to the $7,000 annual contribution. Any additional investing must be done in the cash account. As a result, the current optimal solution would be to contribute into the Roth IRA up to the limit and invest the remaining $193,000 in the cash account and continuing the annual contribution into the Roth IRA in following years.  &#x200B:  Margin account of $7,000 + $7,000 (margin) = $14,000. $14,000 + 30% = $18,200. Gain of $4,200 - 15% (tax) = Gain of $3,570 - my cost of margin for 1 year which is (.13 \* 7000) = Gain of $3,570 - $910 (margin) = Gain of $2,660.  &#x200B:  I can see that in this example, with the same $7,000, AFTER taxes AND cost of margin, the margin account is the better choice as opposed to both the cash account and the Roth IRA. Similar to the cash account, I have no annual contribution limit, can withdraw at any time, and can invest the full $200,000. With margin, this amount becomes $400,000. As a result, the current optimal solution appears to be investing the full amount of $200,000 + $200,000 in the margin account and disregarding the Roth IRA entirely.  &#x200B:  While I take much greater risks investing that amount in a margin account and having the knowledge/information that the average of Apple's yearly losses is \~-30%, over the long term, it's clear on paper that the optimal strategy is to go full margin, with the honest hope that the first 2-3 years are positive. I also expect my current effective margin rate of 13.00% to decrease as rates go down. I also expect my income to increase at a reasonable pace. I'm not sure if it's worth mentioning or not but I would like to marry and have children in the future.  &#x200B:  Again, is my math (and logic) correct? Am I completely overlooking something?  &#x200B:  Thanks!!  &#x200B:  &#x200B:";"0";"2023-12-22T18:56:12"

I know that smartphones is a cyclical industry and is currently in a slump. Qualcomm still has high inventory issues and have guided another quarter of falling revenues and earnings.  Having said that, **Qualcomm's intrinsic value based on DCF is around $156** https://valueinvesting.io/QCOM/valuation/dcf-growth-exit-5y  It is diversifying beyond smartphones and is aggressively pursuing automotive and IoT markets.  It also released a new chip that brings AI to smartphones. While the applications are limited to battery monitoring and camera improvements (hardware based) right now, they can easily move to other areas of enhancements.   Regarding loss of revenues from Apple, it will still take Apple 3-4 years to phase out existing devices that use Qualcomm chips. The 5 billion revenue Qualcomm gets from Apple will be covered by IoT + automotive by then.  Lastly, people can only delay buying a smartphone, not avoid it completely, especially buying high end phones. Which means once the slump is over, Qualcomm will make a very strong comeback.  Any thoughts? I want to buy more but would love to hear some critical arguments in the mean time.  Edit: Qualcomm's also making PC chips.

But I do have maybe 10-15% in single stocks, just to satisfy the inner (wannabe) Buffett.  So we've all heard the advice that diversification is important when building a portfolio. Correct me if wrong, but this can mean across different stocks, or by diversifying across assets, like stocks and real estate.   I was looking for some online calculator that could find the correlation between two stocks and found this:  https://www.buyupside.com/calculators/stockcorrelationinput.php  It lets you put two stocks and the time period to calculate the correlation between.   Could something like this be used just as a rudimentary tool. Either to see how whether you're actually as diversified as you think or to see you're not over concentrating in one area. Like investing in 5 different popular tech giants, which seems to be a thing some people do.   However, some results I found were a bit strange so not sure if that means using figures like these are not so useful? Eg, apple and Goldman Sachs had a correction of 0.8585 over the past 5 years and 0.9058 over the last 10 years. Or Nvidia and PepsiCo also having a correlation just over 0.85.   Are these figures just because stocks have generally all gone up over these time periods so the end result would be that mathematically they are correlated? Even though they are completely different industries/business models?  So can mathemical concepts/figures like these be useful, or do they not mean much since they are backwards looking, and it's better to diversify by knowledge of the different businesses. Such as, we might say intuitively that Apple and PepsiCo should be uncorrelated, no matter what price history suggests?  A final thought I'd like to hear opinions on, would be choosing from different industries based on the most diversification available.   Eg, you pick Microsoft and apple in the tech sector (not in your portfolio, just as two options available) and PG and PEP in, not sure the exact industry name, but say consumer products? You've done whatever prior research you saw fit to arrive at these businesses and now want to narrow things down for whatever reason.   And then have a 2*2 matrix with the different correlations between pairs. If there is a pair that might have significantly lower correlation than the other three, maybe you could pick that? Or is this still not very useful?";"1";"2024-01-07T22:43:24"

"Once a Hot Stock-Market Trend Has a Name, Its Best Days Are Likely too late";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b3zmhb/once_a_hot_stockmarket_trend_has_a_name_its_best/";"Once a Hot Stock-Market Trend Has a Name, Its Best Days Are Likely Past -- Journal Report   March 1, 2024 (Dow Jones)   By Derek Horstmeyer   Once a stock-market trend has been identified and named -- think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven -- the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.   To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Marín Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.   The final list of named trends we researched was:   \-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.   \-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.   \-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.   \-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestlé, L'Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.   \-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.   \-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.   \-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.   \-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce   Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.   From first mention   Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.   For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S&P 500.   The first interesting finding: When we look at the average of all these eight named trends, we see considerable price run-up before the trade being named. For the 24 months before the zero-date, we see the average named trend deliver 36% in excess returns. This means that if you magically knew about a new named trend before it happened, you could earn 36 percentage points above the S&P 500 for the two years before it was named.   Worth the ride, until...   But even if you don't have this magical foresight, it still doesn't hurt to ride a trend once it has been coined. On average, once the trend has been named and looking ahead 12 months, an investor can still earn about 13 percentage points in excess returns.   Yet 12 months following the naming is about the best you can do as returns peak at this point on average and decrease a bit subsequently. From the 12-month mark to the 24-month mark after a trend has been named, the average named trend lags behind the S&P 500 by about 2 percentage points.   When we look at the individual named trends, it might surprise people that the two best trades from the zero-date to the 24-month mark in our sample were the BAT and Cloud trends -- both earning more than 60% in excess return over the two-year period once they were coined by the press.   On the other end, the MT SAAS trade did the worst, dropping more than 95% in excess returns over the two-year period after being named.   All in all, this means your best option is to jump on a named trend as soon as you first hear about it -- provided you haven't been too late to the party -- and ride the initial momentum, if it happens. But if you get in past the 12-month mark, the returns might not be so magnificent.

"WHO WOULD BUY INTO BITCOIN ETF?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ae49w6/who_would_buy_into_bitcoin_etf/";"I know I’m late to this topic, but I want your take on bitcoin ETF, why or why not you’d buy into it.  For me, I’m still a bit iffy, which leads me to not buy into it. I still don’t see any real value in bitcoin all together. Yet, it’s enticing to buy into bitcoin, dispite its high volatility, to make huge profit. Only problem is, bitcoin is not backed by anything. Not a lot of stores even except bitcoin as payment systems.                                        Even though bitcoin ETF has been around for quite a long time, its approval by the SEC could have many impacts in the future. But it could also lead to huge complications to bitcoin itself as for what its purpose is. If so many non-bitcoin investors begin to invest in this ETF, this could possibly lead to the government approval of bitcoin. Yet, bitcoin itself is meant to be a currency without government interference. Flip side, could bitcoin have a huge spike in price. If that’s so, would buying bitcoin now be worth the risk? I know many young kids who find bitcoin to have value, but I just don’t understand how they see value in it.  Edited: took out “fiat”. Because I did complete use it wrong here.

I just wanted to have three threads in a row with Nvidia in the title. Though this title is taken directly from MarketWatch.

The fact, I often brag about me being around, for that bubble, which gives me experience with it, and we’re still pulling metrics from that era  From MarketWatch:  https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidia-fueled-tech-rally-puts-nasdaq-composite-record-in-sight-59951214?g=ad5aec42-f1a1-40d9-aa8d-ab928ce5fed8&mod=djem_mwnbulletin  > An Nvidia-led rally is helping to push the Nasdaq Composite toward rarefied territory, with the tech-heavy index near its first record close **in 27 months.**  > The Nasdaq Composite COMP was up 346 points, or 2.2%, at 15,927 Thursday morning, near its record close of 16,057.44 set on Nov. 19, 2021.  > If the Nasdaq were to finish above that threshold 16,057) Thursday, it would end a drought of **564 trading days without a record close,** according to Dow Jones Market Data. That’s the longest such stretch since a run of 3,801 trading days running from March 2000 to April 2015, following the bursting of the dot-com bubble.  Wow  > The other two major U.S. stock indexes — the large-cap benchmark S&P 500 SPX and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA — have scored a string of records in early 2024.  > The Nasdaq’s long drought after the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000 left many investors particularly wary of declaring a return of the bull market after the index’s most recent slide. After all, the Nasdaq saw three rallies of 40% or more over the course of the bear market that followed the dot-com bust, with none marking the beginning of a lasting bull,   There’s a lot of good points here. One that surprising is the fact that the NASDAQ composite hasn’t broken a record in over 500 days.   Everyone is saying that technology is the only one benefiting from this bull market. But the NASDAQ, which is really tech heavy, has been under performing Dow and s&p.   Another is like said: the .com bubble burst is still being felt today.

Even following the recent market adjustment, **Apple** boasts a valuation exceeding $2.6 trillion, with **Microsoft** at $2.34 trillion, and **Alphabet** at $1.56 trillion.  How can this be? **Don't large tech firms also face the threat of economic downturns?**  Indeed, they do. However, the members of the MAMAA conglomerate (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet) took proactive measures to prepare for a potential economic slowdown by decreasing spending, which included a **reduction in labor costs**...  The recent **turbulence in the U.S. banking sector** has further funneled funds into the tech industry. Investors have shown a preference for companies boasting substantial profit margins and large cash reserves over more traditional safe-haven assets.  Another factor driving growth has been the **surge in Artificial Intelligence**. Investors anticipate that the capital injected into this sector will yield increased sales and, subsequently, elevated profits. Microsoft, for instance, anticipates a 6.7 percent revenue increase in the current quarter due to the rising demand for AI solutions.  Heading into 2023, the IT sector strikes a somewhat subdued chord: the Nasdaq Index suffered a decline of almost 33% in 2022. However, with **decreasing inflation** and the **prospect of a pause in Fed rate hikes**, tech stocks have regained their allure.  One also should not forget to note that key support propping up Nasdaq members was **stock buybacks**. Recall, too, that both Alphabet and Apple recently announced buybacks amounting to $70 billion and $90 billion respectively. Additionally, Meta, formerly Facebook, announced a stock buyback of $40 billion.  What lies on the horizon? **What are the analysts' predictions?**  Michael Landsberg, Chief Investment Officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management, asserts that [large tech stocks are currently overvalued](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/megacap-tech-stocks-out-of-control-big-tech-still-has-the-power-to-extend-the-rally-and-weather-an-economic-storm-analysts-say-a60b6bc3). For example, Microsoft shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 34.3, while Amazon's PE ratio (TTM) stands at 273.79.  On the other hand, analysts at Bank of America [do not foresee any reason for alarm](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worries-over-big-tech-driving-135954915.html), and they predict that the flourishing market will persist.  So **what should we anticipate next?** If the Fed deviates from its hawkish stance, the rally could possibly extend. If not, the recent market correction may appear minor in comparison to what could transpire. Additionally, the approaching debt ceiling deadline could provoke another stock market adjustment, as new Treasury debt issuance could drain Fed reserves and curtail liquidity.";"3";"2023-05-24T17:02:49"

"About business strategies";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15pe87g/about_business_strategies/";"In the last few years there were a lot of articles on McDonald's about expanding their business model. They started to buying real estate in the whole world and now they make most of their earnings through real estate.  Other Companies adopted, expanded or switched their strategy too. Either for external reason and some for internal ones. Most of them are pretty reasonable in hindsight, but were innovative when introduced. For example:  * Apple expanded from hardware to service ecosystem * Apple switched from just buying chips to designing them (peak with the M-series) * obviously, Netflix changed from physical copies to streaming * when the clothing industry went heavy on offshoring in the 90's (?) * US Digital companies optimized their business through tax optimization (in EU through Ireland) * Surprisingly the industry in the agricultural sector is leading in many new innovations like autonomous driving/automation with leaders like Deere.  My question is, where can i find more information about this? Are there any good books, documentaries, videos etc. you can recommend?   What are strategies, which impressed you or you find really remarkable? There are so many big and smalls companies out there and you guys are all very curios and analytic :) and yes i'm aware this is a really open question with so many possible aspects.

With how fluctuating some stocks are, what are the obvious and glaring cons to just continuing to repeat this approach.   If say you bought the stock at an even $100 and it trended up to $200 after a few months, and then it started a week long gradual spiral and is at $180 and you decide to sell it then. Wouldn’t you just profit the $80.   Obviously if the company is bankrupt in the short term you invested or never goes positive from the day you invested you lose money.

We’ve all heard the mantra “you’ll never beat the market” but is that really true any more or does the phrase need some sort of updating?  I’ve been investing for 15 years now and I think I be beat the market or at least the overall S&P500 every single year.  There might have been a year that I nominally missed but if you add up all my investments and look at the gains, it’s significantly higher than if I just invested in a boring S&P ETF.  My Fidelity account does this for me automatically and I’ve always been higher…for over a decade now.   So hear me out, I’ve made some dumb mistakes and lost $$$ along the way but my winners have always offset that. My game plan is pretty simple: always invest in large cap stocks.    With a diverse portfolio made up of Microsoft, Nvidia, Facebook (now meta), Amazon, Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, Amd, and a few others, I’ve found this sector completely destroys the overall “market.” Sure I have a few outliers like Home Depot and OLIN but when I look at my pie chart, it’s very aggressive and very heavily in tech.    The difference in the S&P vs the NASDAQ confirms this over the last 20 years or more and you could argue I’ve built my own sort of NASDAQ mutual fund in a ways, but I’m still beating the NASDAQ too.    The contrarian’s argument is that given enough time, my large cap tech picks will eventually falter and I will begin losing but at the amount I’m up right now, for over a decade, that correction would have to be astronomical and I don’t see how the whole world economy wouldn’t fall if these tech picks crash down 50% at once.    I’m not trying to brag or troll this group or anything like that.  I’m just genuinely interested to know if tech has made it relatively easy to now beat the overall market, and if so, what consequences does that have on the stability of the whole market if more investors start doing what I’m doing?    Is there a point where the “market” is all tech now?  It sure feels like the S&P is so heavily weighted by tech now that maybe that’s the real underlying answer to my question.

Also, I'd like to understand more about how the holdings are managed. For instance, QDVE has significant portions in companies like Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA. If a company like NVIDIA were to perform poorly, how would the portfolio manager handle this? Can they adjust the holdings to keep the ETF stable, and if so, how does this process typically work?   Any advice on mitigating these risks and protecting my investment, as well as insights into the management of ETF holdings, would be greatly appreciated.   Thanks in advance for your help!";"1";"2024-02-21T12:49:18"

I've done well in capital intensive companies like Chevron, Exxon, UPS, and Olin. But I can't ignore what I've learned most recently about ROC. The obvious example of a smashing success with good ROC is Apple.  Interestingly, BRKA has 22% NIM and 9.8% ROC. Buffet has extolled the virtues of ROC, but his company puts up better numbers in net income than return on capital.  I can look at numbers all day. The thing I'm asking you folks about is the ""Why?"" Why would I choose excellent ROC over average NIM and vice versa. Additionally, I always find that I have a blind spot.

Or is it possible to simply transfer them?  - I know this is silly, but I like to see things like ""Apple up 12,000+% since you bought it in 2005.""  (It was only a couple shares.

They are the most sophisticated chip fabrication plant on the globe.   TSM is hanging right around the bottom of the channel of the uptrend.   now this is a solid company, solid financials, 2% annual dividend, diversifying into arizona (with struggles) and germany (with both comes a lesser ability to produce chips than the main Taiwan factory), which removes **some** of the risk of being solely in Taiwan. Maybe a japan factory as well?  If you bought around 93-92 dollars, set a stop loss at say 87 or 86 being a significant break in trend, or maybe even as low as 84 or 83, a real break in the trend, you would lose somewhere between 6.5% to 10%.   now if TSM continues the uptrend and we go to 100 you are up 7.5%  if we go to 105 youre up 12.9%  if TSM suprasses a high on its trip down in 2022 around 109 to hit 110, you're up 18.2%  and it just continues up from there, i mean you hit 115 and the risk reward is totally worth it. So you're a long term holder buying into the bottom of the uptrend and setting a stop loss around 88-87, 5-6% risk to make maybe 20% on the high upside, maybe 12.9-7.5 on the lowside.   its a decent bet.   full disclosure i think hanging around the bottom of the trend shows a little uncertainty but it also is opportunity for you. i bought days ago.   &#x200B:";"19";"2023-09-04T05:22:59"

"Liquidating inherited IRA, wanting to build diversity ";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1cg4li5/liquidating_inherited_ira_wanting_to_build/";"In late 2020 I inherited a traditional IRA from my mom, which I need to liquidate within 10 years. Current holdings in the IRA are Apple and Microsoft. I am interested in taking equal distributions from the IRA for the remainder of the 10 year limit, maxing my own Roth IRA, and potentially reinvesting any additional funds after the max Roth contribution. I’m trying to decide the best investments moving forward.  For additional context, I am 47. I want to retire no later than 62. I will have an estimated pension of about 60% of my pre retirement income at that time, and Social Security will bump that up to maybe 75-80% (though I’m not counting on that in my calculations). I will also have a health insurance subsidy that will cover a large portion of my insurance needs. While it’s late in the game, I have begun contributing to a 457b and plan to begin maxing that every year until retirement. My plan would also be to continue maxing the Roth IRA until retirement, as well as make the catch up contributions after 50.  I have an investment portfolio in addition to the IRA that is currently stacked pretty heavily with NVDA. I plan to hold NVDA long term, but possibly sell and reinvest some at some point.  I’m leaning towards an index fund in the Roth to balance out the more “risky” holdings in the other account. I do not actively trade and am primarily interested in long term stable growth investments. I’m fairly new to this and wondering if this seems like the right track.  My broker is also offering a fee based service where they buy/trade actively on my behalf, but I think at this point I am more comfortable investing in something stable and letting it ride - although I’m open to hearing opinions on this.

This has led to me wanting to take the opportunity to diversify my portfolio with some ETFs other than the typical  One of my reasons is that I already invest a hefty amount into funds which have majority Apple and Microsoft. I don't want my entire life's and retirement savings to be 30% dependent on 2 stocks no matter what they are.  I have found many ETFs which buy S&P500 stocks based on various performance indicators. Some are quite speculative which doesn't interest me. But others are based on things such as quality factor, cash flow, volatility, etc.  A couple of examples are MOAT which is based on companies which have a wide moat, or competitive advantage, which would be difficult for competitors to overcome. Another is SPHQ which is based on quality factor.  Both of these ETFs have a 10 year return of higher than the S&P500 despite both being based on S&P stocks. They're just weighted and selected differently. Clearly this has been working and those strategies logically seem like they'd be successful  My question is why are these ETFs and others like them not as popular as the most common bulk, market cap weighted S&P ETFs? Their long term annualized returns obviously made the extra expense ratio worth it for the past decade. Their portfolios logically make sense to me. They do still own a lot of the same stocks just at lower percentages of the overall holdings  This seems like a no-brainer: they are more diversified with better long term track records.

I’ve seen the numbers before, but this really gave me pause.   > These captains of the SS S&P 500 are Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. They've been described as the magnificent seven by many news organizations. Fortunately for me, there's a common thread among this group. They are the only U.S. companies that have ever been valued at a trillion dollars by the public markets. To say these companies are dominating the S&P 500 is a giant understatement. Last year, their collective valuation gained more than $5 trillion. Compare that to the S&P 500's valuation gain of less than $8 trillion. That means the trillionaires were responsible for roughly 65% of the Index's market cap gain last year, despite comprising just 1.4% of its components. But doesn't this go against the main reason behind investing in S&P 500 index funds? Wouldn't the entire index be susceptible to a massive drop if just one of these seven companies failed?  > Phil Van Dorn: Well, I like index funds because they spread out your risk over many stocks and because the expenses are so low. In the mutual fund industry, traditionally, you might be looking at expenses of 1% of assets under management per year, and that can really pile up over time. But with an S&P 500 Index Fund, your expenses get close to zero. But as you have mentioned when you called the group of expensive stocks the Trillionaires' Club, a small group of companies now make up between 27 and 30% of the S&P 500 depending on which day you look at it.  > Jeremy Owens: Right, so that's seven out of 500 companies accounting for more than a quarter or less than a third of the entire market cap of the S&P 500 and really swaying the underlying metrics. What should an investor kind of take from this and how should we look at the S&P 500 moving forward, knowing how much these companies matter?  > Phil Van Dorn: One can say that there's a heck of a lot of risk in the seven companies that make up only 1% of the S&P 500, but make up close to a third of its value.

Here's what I've been thinking: What if you were to sell the put way itm? With enough collateral (I played around with the numbers) you could take a year's salary in the form of one premium on a single, week-long put. You would obviously be assigned, but you'd have an entire year to make up the difference by selling cc's, the stock going up, and dividends. Selling super safe calls (staying way itm) every week should in theory be enough to cover the ""salary"" as well as churn a profit for most of the stocks I analyzed (Nvidia, Apple, even VOO).

I was looking to see how they fare as an investment, given all the other struggling businesses, and if I had bought in 2010, it looks to have been a better investment than Apple, but the difference is that Domino's evaporates their money while Apple doesn't, even though the stock chart only shows more climbing. I have seen other charts like this, but this may be one of the more egregious examples.  My best theory is that they are reducing the amount of shares in circulation steadily over time to keep the price high. So I wonder a couple things: would an investor have actually made 3,000% during this time period, or would their holdings be continually adjusted to reflect the shares float? I guess I'm confusing that with split rules, but it doesn't make sense to make that much money on a business that's barely solvent. And my other question is, if someone had enough cash to short a high-priced stock like this today, would it be a good play given the fragility of the space and the way the stock has been manipulated? I would expect nothing but a quick catastrophe from such a bad business model.  I have a hard time gaining traction and support for my reddit threads when I make them, so I just want to clarify what was eyebrow-raising about the subject of this post. If the market cap is 11B, and they show growth of 3,300% over 13 years, then their capitalization must have been like $3.50, a couple of spare buttons and some pocket lint. Whatever they were doing to keep their graph looking nice while either losing or stagnating could not have helped the overall health of the stock. I think a symptom of the disease they gave themself is that despite a market cap of only 11B, the share price is over $300. I suppose they could split their shares, but it'd have to be like 20-to-1 to have their share price make sense for their market cap. Anyway I didn't mean anything bad by this post, I'm just probably not altogether coherent, but who really is? Who among you has all their ducks in a row, their head seated firmly upon their shoulders? I'm skeptical about the stability of my critics.

"Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1apur6l/looking_at_historical_data_does_it_show_that_this/";"Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market? I say that by looking at the data. For example. Amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. That is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself, but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. Also I have another example. Nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. The margins are high but obviously companies like Meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent GPU solutions to control costs, and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. The same is looking at arm. Arm which trades at like 150 x earnings, or something crazy, literally grows at like 28 percent. That means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity.  Then, if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004, Apple, it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth, a tiny market cap, better leadership. This compared to the 2000's investing environment or earlier is terrible, yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want.     It goes on and on. Looking at Palantir which trades at a crazy multiple, or basically any software company, yes it's possible to buy Palantir or any stock and it triple, but trying to get earnings at a good multiple in other words, Real INVESTING seems to be literally impossible right now.     Even the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like Alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline.      And there are questions like how is this possible and is this partly due to extremely irresponsible Fed reserve activity mainly due to QE pushing valuations to their highest levels ever. Also do the people here think that this is the worst investing environment ever when compared to historical pe ratios?";"0";"2024-02-13T15:28:31"
"Is regulation on private credit too strict?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17xdzxn/is_regulation_on_private_credit_too_strict/";"I'm intrigued by the stringent regulations surrounding private debt products, especially given the limited accessibility for retail investors. The availability private debt products is rather restricted, with only a few ETFs accessible to the public, and Private Credit Funds reserved for high-net-worth individuals. On a theoretical level, debt instruments like loans and bonds seem more suitable for non-expert investors due to their typically lower volatility and seniority in the capital structure, ensuring repayment priority in case of bankruptcy.     Consider the scenario where a retail investor is prohibited from acquiring a portion of a private corporate loan issued to a highly liquid and information-disclosed entity like Apple. On the flip side, these same investors can readily engage in options trading through platforms like Robinhood. This regulatory incongruity raises questions about the rationale behind limiting access to seemingly lower-risk investments while allowing participation in more complex and risk-laden options trading.     While I acknowledge the liquidity aspect, where bond investments typically involve a committed holding period compared to the more fluid nature of equity transactions, I wonder if there are additional facets to this regulatory framework that I might be overlooking. Any nuanced insights into this regulatory dichotomy would be greatly appreciated.";"1";"2023-11-17T13:29:03"

"Could/Should I use zero cost online brokerages to create a DIY custom index fund?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/16tryb7/couldshould_i_use_zero_cost_online_brokerages_to/";"Background: I have \~$60K in a Roth IRA that's invested in a basic weighted S&P 500 fund. My regular 401K is also invested in basic index funds, and I'd like to do something different with the Roth. I have two philosophical issues with standard index funds.   First, because they are weighted to market cap, a relatively small handful of stocks make up most of the index (The top 10 companies make up 30%).  I don't care how big Apple is, or their historical gains, I don't want a single stock composing 7% of my investments.  Secondly, I have moral/ethical concerns with a few of the large companies (who doesn't?), and I don't want my money going to buy their stock, even indirectly through a large index fund. I don't sleep well knowing I might profit from companies doing things that I believe are immoral and/or deeply irresponsible.  Problem: Anything other than a standard weight index fund will have large management fees. Even a 0.5% management fee will take a sizable cut from profits over 20-30 years.  So if it costs $0 to trade, could I just use an online broker to manually buy 100s of stocks, as long as I can buy fractional amounts?  Even if I rebalance once or twice a year, it could be thousands of trades. But it's a Roth IRA, so I don't have to worry about tracking gains/losses for tax purposes. Other than being a time-consuming process that might drive me crazy, are there any other potential downsides?";"0";"2023-09-27T20:19:24"

Small amount left on a 15 year fixed house loan at around 3%. I put $8,400 into a ""catch up"" Roth 403(b) a year.    Seven years ago I had some money to invest that I could afford to lose, so I put it in APPL. This is now roughly 45% of my portfolio. This is too high and no longer in the realm of money I can afford to lose.    I was thinking of selling some of the AAPL each year to finish out the Roth 403(b). I'm in my 50s so can contribute up to $30k a year. I make ~$70k a year.    It would literally take me like ten or eleven years to sell all of my AAPL stock at this rate, but it seems like a great way to reduce my taxable income and to lock in some long term gains.

"Healthcare ETF for HSA, specifically VHT";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1axrow5/healthcare_etf_for_hsa_specifically_vht/";"I saw a pretty interesting strategy the other day and wanted to hear the communities’ thoughts on it.  If you compare a common healthcare ETF, like VHT for instance vs the total stock market, the healthcare fund actually outperforms the total stock market and with less max drawdown. So better performance and less volatility. Will this outperformance continue? Maybe, maybe not.  https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=5xXJ6wBNCXzqUi7OEIMyxu  However, the second part of this strategy is what makes it interesting: Investing solely in VHT in your HSA. The reasoning being if healthcare costs go up in the future, the main beneficiaries of that would be healthcare stocks. The gains in this would then be used to offset the cost of healthcare expenses in the future when you have to draw upon your HSA, probably retirement age or older.  It’s sort of a hedging strategy on healthcare costs. If the costs of healthcare goes up, the healthcare stocks benefit and your HSA will reap those benefits. If the costs of healthcare goes down or even extreme case, there’s universal healthcare, then the HSA is only a small part of your portfolio and you’ll already be ahead by the lower costs of healthcare anyways.

The percentage of consumable sales in revenue is gradually increasing (think Gillette)  **Past performance**  Past performance has been stellar with 3Y EPS and FCF CAGR of **30%+**, but revenue is slowing down (10% growth this year according to the latest guidance by management).  Inmode has the **highest** gross margins in the industry (83-84%).  **Insider ownership**  Insiders sold a big stake in their holdings in 2021 when the price of the stock in the market was high. They own about 8% at the moment (down from 35% in the past)  **MOAT**  After a thorough analysis, I concluded that Inmode has a **narrow MOAT** meaning they have a competitive advantage in **manufacturing** (by outsourcing it which makes their business capital-light compared to competitors). Their only other competitive advantage is **distribution**. They sell to 92 countries at the moment. Each country has its own regulations (FDA) and hoops to jump through before being able to sell.  **Capital allocation strategy**  Inmode boasts a **very high historical return on invested capital** (200%) and incremental invested capital. They have earned well above their cost of capital. They are piling up cash and have an employee incentive program that is dilutive. In 2022, for the first time, they **bought back shares** to offset this dilution. They claim to actively look for acquisition, but it will be difficult when looking at how high their margins are.  **Industry**  This is a **competitive** industry with a lot of players. When comparing profitability in the industry, Inmode is the most profitable company in the space. Overall, the industry is barely creating value.   **Impact of the current conflict**  Inmode HQ and manufacturing suppliers are located in the north of Israel where it is calmer. They claim to have about 3 quarters of supplies in stock in case of a supply problem.  **Investment thesis**  ***The good***  * At the current price, the market is expecting a **no-growth scenario** (based on an inverse DCF model) * I consider this to be an **overreaction** * Their business model (sales of platforms) is **strengthening** by an increase of the sales in consumables * I think there is an **asymmetry** here based on the recent price drop  ***The bad***  * They haven't been shareholder-friendly in the past * Significant reduction in insider ownership  **Possible catalysts**  * Future **share buybacks** or acquisitions * The use of Ozempic leads to loose skin leads to Inmode's solution * **Growth** in other areas: women's wellness and ocular treatment  I've tried to summarize my 30-page deep dive.

In India there are mainly 2 parties, to put it very plainly, one is like a republican party (BJP) while the other is sort of a democratic (Congress), but there are some minor differences.  Congress support social development projects like increasing the affirmative action (aka reservation) above 50%, since currently it is capped at that number, distributing 1 lakh rs to about 100000+ poor in India by issuing debt and more programs for equality  BJP supports building more infrastructure, making business and foreign investments easier, bringing startups to smaller cities in India, enforcing stronger immigration laws  India has a huge unemployment rate currently, or many are unofficially employed in retail, agriculture and as a result do not show up in the census or pay tax, hence any development in India is bound to have a headwinds from common democratic governance factors like debt, low output, corruption.   India has a huge workforce but is unfortunately yet to be skilled enough to be employed in manufacturing and blue collar jobs. As a result most manufacturers like Apple, Tesla etc. are expecting to face headwinds for the first decade of India investment. But at the same Indian companies can have a boost due to these foreign investments and can also upskill the Indian manufacturing talent at the expense of foreign investments to later have a better blue collar workforce for the Indian companies.  At the same time India has a large caste divide and despite reserving 50%+ seats, the problem is not solved and there are various riots to increase this to more than 50% and expanding this to beyond just the government positions but also enforcing this in the private sector. So this could be a great upliftment program and it is debatable, but this would be a headwind in real development. This is a very politicized topic and as a result there is often violence associated with this.

Current plan is:  \-Open a Roth and max it out for 2023 / 2024  \-Open a SEP and at least put like $10k or so in for 2023 and 2024 (working with accountant now to see how much I can put in there.)  \-Basically put the rest of my liquid $ into VTI and live off my income (maybe put like 10% of my current liquid aside for emergency fund)  Lastly, is there anything I may be missing outside of the things I mentioned above? I have heard some people talking about Annuities which I don't know much about. Also at my age if I'm ok with aggressive investing should I put a chunk into Apple or something just to have a bit more in Tech specifically? I just wanna make sure I am doing things as optimally as I can be. I asked a friend if I should hire a financial advisor and he told me it's not necessary unless you have quite a bit of wealth and need help managing it all, which is not me currently.  Oh, one more thing. A buddy told me to put 10-20% into international like VXUS but it seems like it doesn't do much in comparison to VTI so I was going to lump it all into VTI And not look at it. But any input there?";"0";"2024-03-18T06:31:40"

I did not know their portfolio (2021 thanksgiving) when I said to all of them  to diversify when they were all bragging about their all stock portfolio with huge gains. I did not say what people should diversify into other than a generic suggestion  Bonds, gold, real estate and international assets.   Uncle buying specific Vanguard funds is his own idea.  I thought he was buying 2 grand worth of treasury I-bonds for him and aunt. My question here was how to explain bond market and pacify them - Thanks for the good answers)  About couple of years ago while discussing investments with family, I encouraged family older members to diversify their portfolio and de-risk after big gains of the market after covid recovery.   My aunt and uncle took this to their heart as they realized that good chunk (35%) of their portfolio is purely US stocks (They have $fixed deposits and dividend paying mutual funds too).  They opened Vanguard account sold some stocks and bought  Total Bond market and total  international bond mutual funds or ETF's.  They also bought some Real estate mutual funds and total stock market mutual funds.  Now they regret that decision as all those they bought are 14 -20% loss  except for total stock funds  If they would have kept most of their stocks, it  would have been 10 to 15% gain instead  PS: They are super rich with lot of cash and few investment properties that get them rental income  They always told us the stock portfolio was their answer to gambling urges but with a few the big tech stocks like   Google, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, MSFT etc  I feel really bad I let them down  Could someone help me explain them in simple terms  what happened with Bond market in last couple of years (and the need to have bonds in their investment portfolio) ?";"2";"2023-12-03T00:50:51"

Analysts estimated somewhere around $175 million - and Boeings actual FCF was reported at over $2 *billion*  I know that estimates are just that - estimates. But the difference between a billion and a million is a *lot* of money - not to mention 2 billion.  Does this mean that something increased the demand for one of their products in between Q1 and Q2? If so wouldn’t they be hyping that news ahead of time?  Does this mean that they just reduced expenses by 2 billion in between quarters? That seems like a lot of expenses.  Sorry if this is an elementary question but I’d love to hear some ways in which the actual free cash flow number can be so wildly off the predicted mark.";"0";"2023-07-27T18:21:54"

The advisory fee of 1% feels too high to justify continuing with them, and it looks like all my current holdings in both accounts can be transferred to self-directed accounts without needing to sell any current holdings.  I am 32 years old and max out my Roth every year. This taxable account is not needed in any close timeframe and I have another taxable account that I contribute to regularly. I also have a chunk of money sitting in a HYSA for a down payment on a house which I’m almost certainly no longer going to be able to afford (unrelated, but unfortunate).   My question is this: is the most sensible thing to just keep the current holdings (they’re almost all just ETFs like VUG, VTV, IEFA, and IEMG anyway) and go 100% VT in both of these accounts moving forward? I will continue maxing the Roth yearly and I may contribute more to the taxable intermittently. At 32 I’m not really concerned with bond allocation, but I do want to maintain international exposure. I’m wondering if there’s any sense in a different strategy for the Roth vs the taxable since it’s tax efficient. I’m sure there will be in the future, but at 32 I’m wondering it keeping it super simple in both accounts is best.

"One common mistake of a novice trader";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19fgbu1/one_common_mistake_of_a_novice_trader/";"Let's imagine the mindset of beginners. Beginners want to earn quickly, a lot and with minimal effort. And most likely, we know from our experience, they will be quite fearful. So they will choose those instruments that are well-known and have a good reputation. These will probably be stocks of companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple.  **How will beginners add companies to their portfolio?**   Let's specify that the stocks of these companies are not cheap and cost 100-300 dollars. Of course beginners want to fill their portfolio on enthusiasm right now. This means our trader will go to the stock exchange and simply buy them.   **What is wrong with that?**   The point is that you should buy shares of even the seemingly coolest and most famous companies not at any moment of time when you want to, but look at whether it is a good time to enter a position.   **What does good or bad timing mean?**   In investing for 10-15 years the concepts of good and bad time lose their relevance. Because for such a long period of time stocks can fall and rise 100 times.  But if we speak about from 1 to 6 months trading, it is very important to choose the right moment. Because you need to earn money rather quickly and you want to earn more, of course.   For the sake of simplicity let's consider 2 companies: META and AAPL.    Both of them have a beautiful growing chart for the last year of trading, but you should not buy both companies now, if you take them for a short term.   The fact is that META and AAPL stocks are at their all-time highs right now. They have rallied strongly over the past couple months and there will soon be a period when the price will be corrected. Since there is no one chart in the market that is a forever rising straight line. There will always come moments of correction. And if you buy their stocks now, you are very likely to buy at the most expensive price in recent times.   That's why it's important to learn how to analyze charts and choose the moments to buy or sell smartly.";"0";"2024-01-25T19:36:53"

Now, my head hurts.";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/14rkfcm/i_just_had_an_online_discussion_about_etfs_now_my/";"The question was whether one owns the underlying assets in an ETF. The obvious answer is no. However, no matter the information or facts I provided, the other person insisted I need to read up on ETFs. Always open to a challenge, I did. This is what I found:  From Bing Chat:  * According to the information I found, when you invest in an ETF, you **don’t own the underlying investments**. [You own units in the ETF and the ETF provider owns the shares or assets](https://moneysmart.gov.au/managed-funds-and-etfs/exchange-traded-funds-etfs). ETF units can be created or redeemed to match investor demand. [This helps the price of the units to stay close to the net asset value (NAV)](https://moneysmart.gov.au/managed-funds-and-etfs/exchange-traded-funds-etfs). * [Most ETFs passively track an underlying index, which is a representation of other securities or asset types, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, or currencies](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4435888-what-is-an-etf). [Shareholders of ETFs do not directly own shares of the underlying securities or assets: they own shares of the ETF itself](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4435888-what-is-an-etf).  From Forbes:  * When you buy shares in an ETF, you don’t actually end up owning a portion of the underlying assets, as would be the case with shares of stock in a company. The financial services firm that runs the ETF owns the assets, and adjusts the number of ETF shares outstanding as it attempts to keep their price in sync with the value of the underlying assets or index  From Nerdwallet:  * The fund provider owns the underlying assets, designs a fund to track their performance and then sells shares in that fund to investors. Shareholders own a portion of an ETF, but they don’t own the underlying assets in the fund.  From The Street:  * ETF shareholders do not own the underlying assets included in the ETFs they invest in. For this reason, they do not get the voting rights that normal stock shares might come with.  I hope I pass. One just needs to understand that when they own an ETF like SCHD, Schwab owns the underlying securities, not the investor. In a strange way, they just own a concept.";"0";"2023-07-05T21:17:20"

"What I wish I knew before...";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1chclst/what_i_wish_i_knew_before/";"I was doing %100 discretionary macro before I found this 4 years ago. I like macro and it comes easy to me, but it was always stressful  and I wanted a strategy that brought more peace but still had high returns. I searched every corner of the internet and stumbled upon this. Very few people will listen, and most will mock me, but this post isn't for them. This post is for the old me that was searching for answers and was ready to change and get started on a solid foundation for fundamental analysis by following the example of some of the greatest of all time. Ok here we go!  The go-to strategy for most people is a low cost index fund. The idea behind this is called the Efficient Market Hypothesis. This idea says that all publicly available information is already reflected in the price of all financial assets. Under this idea, the only way to beat the stock market is to have insider information and to be doing insider trading, because insiders have insider information that is not yet available to the public. Once that information goes public, the information becomes useless.   What people don't understand is that in order for markets to be efficient, there has to be liquidity. Take Apple stock for example. Apple has about $10 billion dollars a day in trading volume, meaning that everyday $10 billion dollars worth of Apple stock is traded on the stock market. This liquidity is what makes it possible for new information to reflect itself in the price without friction. The liquidity allows for a large number of people to analyze the stock and buy and sell freely. Large investors need this liquidity and cannot invest in assets with low liquidity. The richer a person becomes, the smaller their universe of stocks becomes, because they need stocks with more and more liquidity. If a large number of people cannot invest in a stock because it is illiquid, then the possibility opens up that the stock could become inefficiently priced.   What makes the strategy possible is the ""illiquidity premium"". The stock market can be divided into several layers depending on the size of corporations. There are (in descending order), Mega Caps, Large Caps, Mid Caps, Small Caps, Micro Caps, and Nano Caps. The smaller we go, the more illiquid the market becomes which allows for more opportunity to find stocks that are trading at ""inefficient"" prices. However, our chances don't really go up until we get to the nano caps (companies traded below $30 million dollars in market cap). The people investing in nano caps are individual investors and maybe some boutique investment funds because nano caps are too illiquid for large players. As far as I know, there are no nano cap ETFs or mutual funds because they cannot handle the illiquidity. There are some micro cap ETFs and mutual funds however.   Now we know what pond to be fishing in, but we still don't know how to fish. We need a strategy that:  #1: Requires no skill, and is accessible to anyone who can do basic math.  #2 Doesn't take a lot of time.  #3 It should be conservative because we want to keep our money safe.   #4 It should also have a return significantly higher than a broad stock market index because, if it doesn't, then what is the point?   Does this strategy exist? Yes! It is called the Net-Net strategy and it is the highest returning quantitative strategy that I know of. It was invented by Benjamin Graham, who was Warren Buffets mentor. Warren Buffet himself used the strategy for the first 20 years of his career. He stopped using the strategy because he eventually ran into liquidity issues.    The Strategy:   The best way to introduce it is to use an analogy. Imagine someone has a really crappy car. It still runs but the wheels are about to fall off, the paint is chipped and it's making a bunch of noises that are a sure sign of trouble. Could this car be a good investment? Surely not, since it is going to get sent to the scrap yard at any moment. But what if the owner offered to sell it to you at a %50 discount to its scrap value? Now it becomes an attractive investment because we might be able to sell it above its scrap value, since it is still running after all. But if we can't, we can drive it over to the scrap yard, double our money and ride back home on public transportation with a wad of cash in our pocket. Makes sense right?   Take that logic and transfer it over to corporations. The idea is to buy stock in corporations trading below their scrap value. If you were to buy a stock like this, and the next day the management announced the company will be liquidated, you would make money.    The formula for finding the scrap value is to add up all the current (liquid) assets (cash, inventory etc...) and subtract all liabilities. The result is the Net Current Asset Value (NCAV). This is a generic formula for finding the approximate scrap value of a company. The fixed assets (real estate, factories etc...) are ignored and considered as a cherry on top. The most thorough way to find scrap value is to find the liquidation value of the fixed assets as well, but this takes time and the generic formula is good enough. Simple right? It might sound intimidating if you have never heard accounting terms but trust me this is as easy as it gets. If you can operate a can opener, then you can do this basic formula.  If the stock price has a %33 or more discount to NCAV, it is now a candidate for investment. But first it has has to meet 7 more criteria before we invest.    #1 It needs to be an operational company. Seems obvious but if you aren't using a screener, or have a crappy screener, you have to check to make sure it's not just a shell corporation. We will talk more about screeners later.   #2 Is the company owner operated? Why should I have a stake in the company if the management doesn't have a stake in the company? This is actually considered optional by most people doing this strategy but I consider it mandatory, except in special situations. I like to see that the CEO owns at least 5 years salary worth of stock. I also like to see the CEO buying stock on the open market but that doesn't always happen.   #3 The company needs to have a current ratio  above 1.5. A current ratio is a fancy way of calculating if the company has an emergency fund for a rainy day. They need to have enough liquid assets to cover short term liabilities. It is calculated by dividing the current assets by the current liabilities.   #4 The company needs to have a low debt to equity ratio (D/E). This is a simple way to check if there is too much debt. Too much debt could bankrupt a company. First we calculate the equity by adding up all assets and subtracting all liabilities. This is the Net Asset Value (NAV). I like to strip out intangibles and goodwill to calculate Net Tangible Asset Value (NTAV or NTA), but this is optional. Once we have the equity (NAV), we divide the total liabilities by the equity. Some people only divide the long term debt by the equity. We want the D/E ratio to be %50 or lower. Statistically, companies with %20 or lower have had the best returns.   #5 The company needs to have a low burn rate. Generally when companies are trading below scrap value, they are experiencing problems that are hopefully short term. They are generally going through a period of unprofitability. Since they are not able to meet all their expenses from selling product, they may rely on their emergency fund to get them through the tough times. However, we need to see that they have control of their expenses and that they are not burning through their emergency fund too fast. We check this by tracking their NCAV through time.   #6 The company shouldn't be diluting shares. Another way companies can get cash to make it through the tough times, is to sell shares in the open market. Most people running this strategy do not tolerate any share dilution.   #7 The company should have been profitable in the past 10 years. If the company has already been in trouble for over 10 years and they haven't fixed the problem, then the company might be dying. We want companies facing short term problems, not long term problems.   That's basically it. How has the strategy performed? It returns ~25% per year. Don't believe me? Here is a link to a few independent studies:  https://www.quant-investing.com/blog/why-and-how-to-implement-a-net-net-investment-strategy-world-wide  Since the strategy is quantitative in nature and doesn't require investment skill, it can be backtested and many backtests have been performed by different people.   Since this is a statistical strategy, we want to hold 20 stocks at a time to protect ourselves from single stock risk. The stocks are held for a year and then whatever no longer fits the criteria is sold and replaced. The losers are sold before the year end and the winners are sold after a year end to maximize tax efficiency.   Okay so now that the strategy is explained, we have to actually find these stocks. Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett had to comb through thousands of stocks by hand, but we live in modern times and we no longer have to do this. The way to find the stocks is to use a screening tool. The screen searches through a financial data base of stocks and pulls out all the stocks trading below NCAV. A high quality screener will also screen for the 7 things I outlined, except for insider ownership,  that you have to do yourself. With a high quality screener, I can just pluck 20 stocks from the screen and buy them. I don't have to do any calculations or further research. If I have a crummy screener, I will have to check everything myself.   If you have a good screen, the only work is actually buying and selling the stocks. Since the stocks are illiquid, there is usually a large spread between the bid and ask price. You will have to learn how to place your own limit orders and it could take weeks to get your orders filled. So there will be work in managing the portfolio. Getting locked into investments from illiquidity is not a problem. I am in contact with several people running the strategy and getting locked into an investment  has never come up in conversation but it is technically possible, especially if you have a lot of money. But in general, if you are able to buy the stock, then you will be able to sell the stock. The strategy becomes difficult to implement once the investor has $5-$10 million dollars. Once you get over $5 million, you may have issues buying and selling and you will get locked out of the strategy eventually. This is what happened to Warren Buffett. Once he got locked out, he had to adjust his strategy and became the investor he is today.   The reason why you have never heard of Net-Nets is because nobody has a financial incentive to tell you about it. Wall Street is not going to tell you about it because they cannot package it into an ETF or mutual fund to sell it to you. Rich people are not going to tell you about it because they can't focus on it (because of liquidity). Maybe your financial advisor would tell you IF they were competent. But as we all know, they are not competent, which is why we fired them and bought an index fun instead. This strategy has fallen into obscurity because markets have become so efficient, but it is still used among a small group of people in the most inefficient stratum of the market, the nano caps.   That about wraps it up. I want this information  to get out there because I want to see you succeed in your financial goals. I just happened to stumble on this, but if you don't tumble down the right rabbit hole, you will never find out about this. But now you have! Knowledge is power.

"Trying to figure out how to properly manage my finances";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/16p1b9m/trying_to_figure_out_how_to_properly_manage_my/";"I [M28] have had a long journey investing and trading, and have lost a lot of money, and I’m now trying to do my very best to reallocate my funds.   Here’s what I have at the moment:  $12k in checking account $10k in 401k (haven’t been contributing but I am maxing it out this year and should have ~$28k by the end of the year)  $20k in Roth IRA  $103k in individual brokerage   Much of my holdings have been in ARK ETFs (I know this was an awful decision, but I was young and made some poor choices).   I’m wanting to exit those losing positions hopefully soon and sort out how else to allocate those funds. I will probably have the Roth IRA managed by my retirement company once I exit those positions so I don’t have to worry about it. I’ll also be getting quite the tax harvest from the selling the positions in my brokerage account.   With all the losing positions I sell in my brokerage, I’ll have ~40k of cash to do whatever with. The other ~$63k is invested in TSLA, Google, Microsoft, Apple, AMD & AMZN. I have a $30k position in TSLA, so that’s most of it.   I’m thinking about taking the $40k I get from my losses and putting it in a HYSA, but not sure that would be the best thing to do. I think it would certainly be much less stressful than investing over $100k myself, but I also don’t think I’ll need the money very soon.   I’m single and currently live in Denver (I hate it here), and would love to be able to go to a warmer place, potentially San Diego if I can afford it. I don’t know much about buying a house nor do I feel confident enough in a city to buy one, so still renting for now. My rent is 2.3k here, and would be much higher in a place like SD. I’m hoping to get a decent raise soon that would be closer to $200k, but not sure if it’s gonna play out yet or not.   Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Please be gentle because I know ARK was a mistake and I’m trying to do the right things now. I’m trying to get out of the mindset of recovering my losses through investments, and would like to be able to live more peacefully and not check the market every day.   Thank you!";"0";"2023-09-22T06:49:49"
"[D] The Question facing Nvidia";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/13l5gc0/d_the_question_facing_nvidia/";"The problem this stock faces is no one knows how to value it.  The company are investing in technology that opens up new markets (AI, Omniverse and self driving for example).  Will those markets pan out or will they go bust?  And if they do pan out, what's the value of those markets?    Nobody knows, these markets haven't been served before.  Today's share price is a reflection of the market sentiment, the voting machine's results as of this moment.   The current share price is either grossly over extended or grossly undervalued -- there is no in between in my opinion.  I believe Nvidia has cemented itself as the hardware technology leadership company of the era, much like IBM and Intel of past decades.   Some on Wall St understand this, others are coming to understand it.  But there are many who doubt that is the case as well.  The most obvious question from doubters is about competition:  Won't AMD or Intel or Google or Apple just come in with better technology and take their position?  I've been invested in this company for more than 15 years and what they do uniquely are two things:  1.  Strategize and 2.  Execute.   They have been building a GPGPU platform (General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit), otherwise known as ""accelerated computing"" since about 2007.   It's different from standard CPUs in that it processes massive amounts of data in parallel, tens of thousands of ""cores"" operating at the same time.  Their platform is a combination of inter-generational compatible hardware and software.  The platform is robust, reliable, well supported, offers regular performance improvements, and is now ubiquitous with over 4million developers using it including nearly every AI developer on the planet.  So when a competitor comes to throw their hat in the ring, there is an enormous defensive position to overcome that includes a large user base who are getting reliable, quantifiable and predictable results.    Since 2014 predictions of Nvidia's demise in the data center have been constant from both mammoth technology companies (AMD, Intel, Google, Baidu) and startups alike.    But no one has been able to make a real dent in Nvidia's momentum and share -- not with CPUs, ASICs, FPGAs or any other technology.  In their core area of AI model training, Nvidia has between 85-95% market share depending on whose numbers you look at.   They are serving this with the largest, most complex mass produced semiconductor devices man can imagine.  What about other GPUs?   GPUs have proven an excellent solution for the job, they are readily available, flexible and performant.  AMD and Intel are building new GPUs and pursuing as "" AI is their number 1 priority.""  I expect these companies to pick up some business simply because Nvidia cannot service 100% of the demand they are creating.  But these well-regarded companies have a difficult hill to climb in software.  They need to make their products work as well as Nvidia's to be competitive, if they don't they will likely sell at a deep discount.  A ""real"" competitive offering will have to exceed Nvidia's solution in both performance and ease of use.   I haven't seen that sort of competitor surface in the past 10 years, nor can I see one on the horizon.  There may be one lurking -- certainly a possibility -- but it will take 2-4 years minimum for that type of solution to come to market.   In the mean time, Nvidia is out re-architecting data centers with AI-centric chip solutions:  CPUs, GPUs, DPUs and networking and switching technology.  They continue to raise the bar for competitors.  Soon data center processing will be managed by AI techniques to yield better, faster, more power efficient results sooner.     Nvidia owns data center acceleration -- the nexus of AI -- for the near term.  Is AI a real technology that has launched and will add value to human kind in innumerable ways, or does it sputter and fizzle into another ""AI winter"" from whence Nvidia becomes a footnote in history?   That is the question on this company's share price.  FPE, PS, DCF ?  These are just irrelevant metrics in this context.";"93";"2023-05-18T19:39:57"
"Rebalancing portfolio for growth and being tax savvy - is this a good plan?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15j50cg/rebalancing_portfolio_for_growth_and_being_tax/";"My fiduciary is proposing rebalancing my portfolio which was inherited and currently focused on wealth maintenance rather than growth, but I’m not experienced and have no clue if what is being suggested makes sense. I’m 43 yr old, will have a pension upon retirement, have around $250,000 in high yield savings, my home is paid, no debt except for around 23k in student loans with low interest. Wife has around 160k in a 401k.  Main goals for this portfolio are retirement income and I would like to be tax smart:  -BrandywineGLOBAL Corporate Credit BCGIX MF 15% -Vanguard Total Bond Market BND ETF 15% -Vanguard Value VTV ETF 15% -Apple AAPL Stock 14% -Berkshire Hathaway BRKB Stock 10% -Vanguard Health Care VHT ETF 10% -Vanguard S&P 500 VOO ETF 10% -Vanguard Total World Market VTV ETF 5% -Vanguard Utilities VPU ETF 5% -Fidelity Government Capital Reserves FZAXX MF 1%  While the portfolio allocation propsed above has historically generated near or above stock market level performance while taking significantly less risk (which is a good thing), one of my concerns for your account is to reposition the assets to a more tax-efficient allocation.  One of the ways to achieve this is in a taxable account using ETF’s for stock-oriented investments as opposed to mutual funds.  Mutual funds are required to pay out to shareholders and capital gain distributions from mutual funds which result in a taxable event.  Over the past two years your  account has generated taxable capital gain distributions of $8,000- $10,000 annually.  ETFs and individual stocks do not have to follow the same tax rules that apply to mutual funds, and therefore instead of paying out capital gain distributions to shareholders, they take the gains generated by the sale of stocks and just purchase more stocks.  Since the capital gain distribution is not paid out to you the result is avoidance of taxation.       The value of a couple stock oriented investments in your account have increased in value so if we were to sell the shares of those investments to rebalance  it would result in a capital gain of approximately $11,000± for 2023 taxes, but then going forward we no longer have those annual tax burdens.  Does the above sound ok? Or what should I be asking him?  I am trying to learn about investing instead of relying on Reddit but it’s a slow process so I appreciate this forum.

"NVIDIA - 2023 Q4 earnings projections";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19cfixe/nvidia_2023_q4_earnings_projections/";"[The new 2023 Q3 figures come from a market analysis firm named Omdia (via Tom's Hardware)](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-ai-and-hpc-gpu-sales-reportedly-approached-half-a-million-units-in-q3-thanks-to-meta-facebook):  *Meta and Microsoft, each purchasing 150,000 GPUs. Those two companies were responsible for 300,000 units, with the other 200,000 going to the rest: Oracle, Tencent, Google, and Amazon, Tesla, TickTok, Baidu, Alibaba.*     ***Q3 reported revenue was 18 bills. The reported 500k number seems to be true.***       **Now the question is, who will be ordering another 500k batch in Q4? so that at least the Q4 result won't pale in comparison and won't be a disappointment for investors?**     META to the rescue (Hopefully)! As Zuckerberg stated:  [*“By the end of this year, we’re going to have around 350,000 Nvidia H100s. Or around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute if you include other GPUs.”*](https://www.pcmag.com/news/zuckerbergs-meta-is-spending-billions-to-buy-350000-nvidia-h100-gpus)   , which means they might order another 200k from Nvidia, or he may *""find 2\*x H100 equivalent to compute""* to avoid paying a premium over generally specialized Nvidia GPUs and buy more specialized and power-to-output optimized ASICs chips like Google's TPUs.       I don't think other big tech (Microsoft, OpenAI, and AWS) giants will order more GPUs because running a general-purpose GPU is very expensive: [Running ChatGPT is very expensive for the company. Each query costs roughly 4 cents, according to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/)   Google already has its own ASICs chips called TPU.    Apple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet, then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family.      Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run.  And want to diversify to other chip makers, like AMD, Intel, and specialized ARM makers.     Small businesses experiment and run their AI models using rented Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud capacities (mostly Google because of their TPU's low power-to-cost ratio).      The rest of the market is peanuts to make any dent.      **\[Conclusions\]:** Their a moderate-low probability Q4 revenues will reach a plateau of around 15-20 billion.  A moderate probability that they will be below 15 billion. A low probability of exceeding 20 billion.  &#x200B:  ***Let's sidestep to AI marker TAM topic,***        [*Meanwhile, looking forward to 2027, the server market's value is estimated at a staggering $195.6 billion.*](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-ai-and-hpc-gpu-sales-reportedly-approached-half-a-million-units-in-q3-thanks-to-meta-facebook)   However, this estimated revenue will be brought by those who rent AI processing capacities like AWS, GCP, and Azure cloud providers. And not ChatGPT clones. The market has not figured yet the TAM (total addressable market) of services like ChatGPT.       However, I try to speculate on [open numbers](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users), which have stagnated for the last 6 months.      100 million monthly active users \* 10$ per subscription produces 1 billion in revenue.    [The average cost of 1 query from a used is 4 cents](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/).     A single user runs 2,000 queries per month on average. The query is a single text message you send to the chatbot.      2000 \* 0.04 = 80 $ to service 1 user per month.    Until the OpenAI level of efficiency improves they will be losing 70$ to service 1 user per month.    No wonder OpenAI has closed its ChatGPT Plus subscription.  It doesn't seem sustainable.     Last note,  the majority of data centers upgrade their equipment every 4-5 years. So, if AI expectations won't burst, and chip efficiency improves 10-fold, and other chip makers won't catch up, don't expect big tech to re-stock their chips earlier than the end of 2027.      &#x200B:";"3";"2024-01-21T23:17:52"
"CNCX Concentrix stock - Undervalued?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/14kyik3/cncx_concentrix_stock_undervalued/";"Let me know if this looks good and any comments/upvotes will be appreciated. Feel free to ask any questions whatsoever that makes you contest my opinion or just another stock you would like me to analyze.  Unemployed and lost but want to see if I am any good with analyzing stocks. Fundamental stock analysis of decent size companies (no penny stocks or crazy tech companies): I have no idea in technical analysis. I am thinking if I am any good I could do some YouTube videos on some of the stocks most requested by the community here and help people make money. I will be using conservative numbers wherever I think it is possible.  Concentrix CNXC is a traditional CX call center service that has many clients like Apple etc. **Three of the most important factors for analyzing stocks is History, Competitors, and Outlook -- so I will be trying to put my take on it and make it short as possible.**  **Competitors:**  |As of 2022|Teleperformance TLPFY|TTEC Holdings TTEC|Majorel MAJ.AS|Concentrix CNCX| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |||||| |Revenue|8.2 bn|2.5 bn|2.1 bn|9.8 bn| |Gross Profit|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A| |Operating Margin|994 M (12.2%)|250 M (10%)|210 M (10%)|980 M (10%)| |Assets|4.4 bn|1.1 bn|1 bn|4 bn| |Liabilities|(5.2 bn)|(1.5 bn)|(1 bn)|(8 bn)| |Asset - Liabilities|(800 M)|(400 M)|0|(4 bn)| |Enterprise Value|10 bn (10 times)|2.5 bn (10 times)|2.1 bn (10 times)|9.8 bn| |Market Value|9.2 bn|2.1 bn|2.1 bn|5.8 bn| |Should be Market Price|158|44|22|115| |Actual Price|162|35|29|83| |Difference|N/A|\+25%|\-25%|\+40%|  **History:**  The biggest competitor to Concentrix is Teleperformance. So comparing the history of Teleperformance should tell you what the normal range of valuation should be for Concentrix.  ||2021|2020|2019|2018|2017| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Revenue|8.73 bn|8.06 bn|7.05 bn|6 bn|5.08| |Gross Profit|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A| |Operating Margin|870M (10%)|800M (10%)|700M (10%)|600M (10%)|500M (10%)| |Assets|5 bn|4.5 bn|4 bn|3.3 bn|2.7 bn| |Liabilities|(5.9 bn)|(5.7 bn)|(4.9 bn)|(4.2 bn)|(3 bn)| |Asset - Liabilities|(1 bn)|(1.2 bn)|(1 bn)|(1 bn)|(300M)| |Actual Enterprise Value|23 bn|20bn|16bn|11 bn|8.3 bn| |Actual Market Value|22bn|19bn|15bn|10 bn|8 bn| |EV/Revenue|2.75|2.5|2.25|2|1.6| |Average|2.22|2.22|2.22|2.22|2.22|  **Outlook:**  Concentrix is acquiring Webhelp (private) and becoming the biggest CX provider. They are neck in neck with Teleperformance who acquired Majorel for 1.5 times sales to Enterprise Value - means they all feel prices are low enough for consolidation in the industry.  Looking at the first table it looks like Concentrix is undervalued by 40% on already depressed numbers of EV/Revenue as average EV/Revenue for Teleperformance has been more like 2 historically. So prices will be expected to reach $120 on just 1 times EV/Revenue.  But lets say if we give it a more reasonable number of 1.5-2 EV/Revenue then stock price will be expected to reach $160.";"0";"2023-06-28T05:34:19"
"REITs vs SP500 vs dividend delusion";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18punf5/reits_vs_sp500_vs_dividend_delusion/";"I always had this logic if I invest long enough into Reits I would be able to retire with dividends wiithout withdrawing.  Lots of people say once snowball begins you really feel the power of dividends.  I have another 35 years before retirement anyway and residency is UK but more and more doing calculations of profit after each year finish I realise dividends is like fake hope. For example first year my dividends payout was £16.43. This year is £900 range and next year projected £1400 which seems good on paper but these very dividends stock could have been replaced with growth and instead of small realized gains I would of had way more unrealised gains.  But more on reits there is even research that Reits most years outperform SP500 due to the power of reinvesting dividends but after holding Vici (risk but growth) Realty Income (passive but monthly dividend and super diversified) I realised they are both very passive boring stocks both together are 15% of my portfolio.  Of course during high interest rates you wouldnt expect Reits to be exciting but I just did future conservative calculations and slightly doubt whether its even worth holding Reits. Posting here whether I missed something from my calculations that makes it so one sided  Like the way I see snowball effect is when it's growth is  exponential and I thought if for example Realty Income pays you £45 per month that would be enough to buy 1 whole share right  so calculations are you need 264 shares which is £11,880   Year 1  264 shares +£45 dividend monthly Month 1  264+45 Month 2 265+45.05 Month 3 266+45.22 Month 4 267+45.39 Month 5 268+45.56 Month 6 269+45.73 Month 7 270+45.9 Month 8 271+46.07 Month 9 272+46.24 Month 10 273 +46.41 Month 11 274 +46.58 Month 12 275 +46.75  1 year from  264 shares =11,880  To 11,880 +3% annual growth =12,236 +reinvested shares 11 =495 =12,731 7.2% growth  But if invested in growth stock  11,880 +20% 1 year =14,256   So I thought snowball effect doesn't really happen with 11k into Reits but what if I was able to buy 4 Realty Income shares every month is that snowball effect?   £57,000 = 1266 shares =£215.22 per month gives you 4.7 shares at current price  Year 1 1266 shares +£215 dividend monthly Month 1 1266+215 Month 2 1270.7+216 Month 3 1275.5+216.8 Month 4 1280.3+217.6 Month 5 1285.1+218.4 Month 6 1289.9+219.2 Month 7 1294.7+220.1 Month 8 1299.59+220.93 Month 9 1304.4+221.7 Month 10 1309.3+222.5 Month 11 1314.2+223.4 Month 12 1319.1+224.2  After year 1 57000 1266 shares To 57000+3% annual growth =58,710 +53 shares reinvested £2385 61095 7.2% growth  If invested in VUSA 10% annual growth 57000+10% =62700 Plus dividends £772 per year 63,475 11.5% growth  Only reason I chose Realty Income is because it's extremely safe stable diversified stock pays 5% but even with 60k invested I still don't see snowball effect of course everyone says just put it into VUSA and forget but dividend investors talk about how they can outperform sp500 but I don't see whether its even worth trying   Maybe in your last 5 years employed you start exchanging your growth stocks and ETFs for Reits for passive Income but slowly I realized recently, investing into passive dividend stocks while young is a big waste of time and illusion to provide passive Income that isn't there. You can compare year 1 dividends received to current year and say wow snowball effect is real but when you take into consideration on how much growth you missed out. Makes me feel my investing strategy has been used 30 years too early   Even when my portfolio consist of 55% Apple & MSFT just mistakes like TROW DIS SOFI my portfolio every year for 5 years is 3-7% lower than VUSA. Even though stock picking is fun but it really is true VUSA seems the only hassle-stress free strategy. Don't need to readjust anything, don't need to check earnings and new competitors or sales it's so simple. Anyone else had these realizations and just want to sell everything and buy VUSA and relax with DRIP? Or do you keep believing      TL:DR dividend investing and stock picking is counter-productive new year resolution VUSA";"15";"2023-12-24T13:50:15"
"General Electric spinoffs and future";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b5p0gb/general_electric_spinoffs_and_future/";"I had a friend who worked at GE and he called it a bloated monstrosity of incompetence. He was a high level technologist there.   But that was going on a decade ago. At the time they were massively in debt and were making money in a confusing assortment of ways.   Quotes from Barron’s:  https://www.barrons.com/articles/buy-ge-stock-price-pick-ceo-larry-culp-8ce1498c?mod=panda_barrons_custom_topic_alert  GE have sold off a LOT of assets to reduce their massive debt.  > GE has repaid some $100 billion in debt since the end of 2018, bringing its debt load down to just $21 billion. What’s more, free cash flow, which had dropped from $5.6 billion in 2017 to $2.3 billion in 2019, has started growing again: GE generated $5.2 billion in 2023 and should produce more than $6 billion in 2024.  GE is in the process of splitting itself into multiple companies instead of being a mishmash of unrelated products from light bulbs to jet engines. The conglomerate, first started by Edison, is a going to be a very different thing.   > the early 2023 spinoff of GE HealthCare Technologies, which makes medical imaging products, shares of General Electric have gained about 120%, while GE HealthCare has gained 50%. Both have outperformed the S&P 500 index, which has advanced 30% over the same span.  > The final move is due on April 2, with **General Electric splitting itself into two.** The parent company will be renamed GE Aerospace, and will be a maker of airplane engines: and the power business will be spun off and named GE Vernova. **Shareholders will receive one GE Vernova share for every four GE shares.**  > Buying General Electric stock ahead of that split could well pay off handsomely. There’s a strong case that the two new stocks together will be worth more than the existing shares.  > The truth is, all three of the new companies will be dominant players in their respective industries and, remarkably, all three will have investment-grade credit ratings.  > GE Aerospace, though, is the crown jewel. Three-quarters of new single-aisle jets made by Boeing and Airbus carry GE engines, and they’re also found on twin-aisle jetliners like the 787 Dreamliner and jet fighters like the F-18 Hornet. In total, there are more than 40,000 GE engines in commercial airliners and 26,000 in military aircraft.  This is what I’ve honestly been drooling about. The ability to get GE’s aerospace business without being hampered by its credit business, and its thousand other businesses. That’s what this split entails. You want their healthcare, you can invest directly in that.   Conglomerates are early 1900s organizations that benefitted from anti-trust practices. They could lower the costs of a sector to starve out competitors knowing they have income from completely other revenue sources.  But those days are gone, and investors want more focus in their companies. It’s why some of the big tech companies lately have laid off workers and shut down projects. Like apple’s car, and googles many side endeavors.   Sorry, big quote ahead but a lot of good data.  > Both Boeing and Airbus expect the global airline fleet to grow to some 50,000 planes over the coming 20 years, up from about 25,000 today. GE’s aerospace sales and orders both grew about 22% in 2023 compared with 2022. What’s more, every engine GE sells needs to be serviced and cared for. That aftermarket business accounted for 70% of Aerospace’s $32 billion in sales in 2023, and is more profitable than selling new equipment. Wall Street expects operating profit margins to expand by about two percentage points over the coming few years, up from about 19% in 2023, as new engines start to hit the shop for scheduled maintenance. That business should help Ebitda. hit about $8 billion in 2024, up from $7.2 billion in 2023: it could reach $9 billion in 2025  GE is still going to split between aerospace and the power generation business, Vernova. I’m more interested in aero, but I feel it will run up until split and I’ll basically buy 2 companies now at a discount and I can always divest power.  This isn’t typically the kind of company I go for, but I think it has great potential and it’s a famous US name that has hit the skids for…a while now. And I think they got a compelling way forward, even if they lost the lightbulb monopoly.  ";"8";"2024-03-03T20:05:50"
"First-time Poster (go easy)";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15cx8ny/firsttime_poster_go_easy/";"TLDR: Swapping from Edward Jones to Schwab and looking for traditional IRA and other recommendations. \*Apologies for the following novel!     Hey folks, I am looking for some strategic advice. I started investing three years ago when I finished active-duty military service. My wife and I stupidly didn’t save or invest any money during my 20 years of service, so no IRAs or TSP starting off. We collectively were living paycheck-to-paycheck during my military service based on terrible spending habits.     In 2021 we sold a house which netted us around $150k. We bought another (at 2.499 interest) but put very little down because we used our VA loan and I wanted to feel the security of having cash on hand. We have kept the rest of the proceeds in the breakdown below. Not really knowing what I was doing, I opened accounts with Edward Jones and started throwing money at it. We were able to open the Roth's based on my income then, but have since become ineligible to add to those due to high income. Also, we bought all of the individual stocks and watched them plummet in 2022, but they have since recovered and we are basically back where we started.     Fast-forward to now, we still spend what I consider a ridiculous amount of money every month, but we are working to correct it and double-down on investing for retirement. I started working with a great company that does a 5% match with John Hancock, and I am maxing that contribution every year (about $20k) with 75% into RFHTX and 25% into the 500 Index Fund. I am not looking to change that allocation unless folks have a compelling recommendation. Additionally, we have roughly $5k/month that is unused (saved) and put in our normal bank savings account which is really giving us no return, about 60 dollars a month, so not really sure what to do there… I should note that I plan to work for at least the next 15-20 years and expect my current income level to remain static or increase.     So my questions are:    \-	As we are moving into Schwab, what index funds or ETFs would make the most sense for the Roth IRAs?   \-	Should we be maxing out Traditional IRAs with the intent to do a backdoor conversion later?    \-	What should be done with the cash that we have in our bank’s low-interest savings account?   \-	Are we on track or do I need to make some drastic move like taking savings and paying off vehicles / dropping the savings into my mortgage to reduce it / other?      One thought I have is to make the transition to Schwab and put the Roth’s/529s into whatever the advisor recommends. Then liquidating the $50,000 in individual stocks from EJ, put that money into a MMF with Schwab and use that money to fund Traditional IRAs for my wife and I. Would this be a smart move?      Below are some of our financial stats:   Age: 44 – seeking to retire between 60-65 y.o.   Current take home (net) income: $20,000/mo   \-	$12,000 from employment   \-	$8,000 from military retirement & VA disability   Monthly bills: $10,000/month   Discretionary spending: $5,000/mo   Current 401k: $88,000   (Edward Jones) Existing Roth IRAs: $20,000   USAA Savings account: $90,000   (Edward Jones) Kid’s 529s: $8,000 (although both kids have GI Bill, so won’t likely “need” the 529s)   (Edward Jones) Individual stock positions: $50,000   \-	Alphabet (100 shares)   \-	Amazon (60)   \-	Apple (50)   \-	Blackrock (5)   \-	Duke Energy (10)   \-	Meta (20)   \-	Microsoft (10)   \-	Southwest (100)   \-	Disney (20)   ";"3";"2023-07-29T19:02:26"

"What allocation approach is implied by Toby Nangle's new FT article on narrow markets driving equity returns?";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15lgfgb/what_allocation_approach_is_implied_by_toby/";"What I take from the article below is not to rely too much on a macro-driven asset allocation strategy.  But what asset allocation strategy makes sense in this environment then?    &#x200B:  &#x200B:   www.ft.com /content/c5d7ee71-92a2-4840-9344-2f62e9642e61  # Narrow markets should humble macro forecasters  5-6 minutes   2023-08-08   Toby Nangle    The writer is a former global head of asset allocation at a fund manager   This year has been marked by strong equity markets, and what looks to be an astonishingly narrow rally. Of the 16.9 per cent returned by the S&P 500 index in the first half of this year, 12.9 per cent derived from the performance of only 10 companies.   With such a high proportion of a market’s value created by so few groups, it feels fair to question the tool kits of asset allocators and, more broadly, the product line-up of fund management firms.   Narrow stock market returns are, after all, the norm. Research by Arizona State University professor Hendrik Bessembinder shows that more than half of the $55.1tn in net wealth generated by the US equity market between 1926 and 2022 came from the performance of fewer than 0.3 per cent of the market’s stocks, with the other half of this net wealth coming from the next best 3.1 per cent of stocks.   Moreover, almost three-fifths of stocks actually destroyed wealth over the period. In quant-speak, the distribution of compound stock returns has been very positively skewed.   In addition, the skewness of equity returns turns out not to be a particularly North American phenomenon. Indeed, in the three decades ending in December 2020 the proportion of net wealth contributed by the best 1 per cent of emerging market stocks was more than 80 per cent.   Looking at the entire global stock universe outside the US, the proportion rises still further to more than 90 per cent. Winners have won big. Most individual stocks over the past 30 years have failed to outperform dollars stored under the mattress, let alone a local currency interest-bearing cash deposits — even after taking into account dividends.   Bessembinder’s work has typically been surveyed in terms of what it means for active stockpickers — with some seeing it as a rationalisation for chasing moonshots and others for pursuing passive index-investing. Less examined has been what it means for asset allocators.   Developed market stock index returns have been dominated by global companies — even if they each carry a domestic tilt. As such, connecting local macroeconomic developments to the performance of a region’s equity index can be something of a dark art.   Single large stocks with an economic fate that has little to do with their listing jurisdiction have dominated national index returns. For example, the photolithography machine-maker ASML accounts for more than a fifth of the total net wealth created by Dutch stocks in the 30 years up to 2020. Global fast-fashion retailer Inditex accounts for more than a sixth of Spanish stock returns. Global luxury brands LVMH and L’Oréal collectively account for almost a quarter of the returns from French stocks. These are not outliers. One cannot explain long-term returns without reference to such companies in pretty much any region.   If it becomes hard to explain equity index returns without reference to specific superstar groups, it stands to reason that it must be even harder to forecast equity index returns without taking a view on some individual companies. It’s easy today to focus on whether the Magnificent Seven that have powered the S&P 500 rally — Apple, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta — might stumble. With more than a quarter of the US market’s valuation riding on them, the question is not at all trivial. But 30 years ago, five of these seven had not even listed. It’s hard to take a view on companies that don’t yet exist.   I’ve been as guilty as the next asset allocator in explaining my preference for US over European stocks or vice versa with reference to some domestic macroeconomic outlook. Given that financials, utilities and property groups will carry a strong domestic flavour, this is still forgivable.   But when constructing a long-term strategic asset allocation, it is becoming increasingly untenable to justify regional preferences with reference to local macroeconomic forecasts. This may explain why long-term return forecasts for equity markets — or Capital Market Assumptions, as they are known — have such a lousy record.   The biggest single investment decision any institutional or individual investor is likely to make in their portfolio is their choice of strategic asset allocation. To create a strategic asset allocation one must make reasonable guesses about future market returns. Bessembinder’s research shows quite how invariably such reasonable guesses will be blindsided by the fate of single stocks.";"1";"2023-08-08T14:11:15"
"Gogoro Q1 Sales Numbers and Recap - DD";"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1bwfp7t/gogoro_q1_sales_numbers_and_recap_dd/";"**Q1 Scooter Sales in Taiwan**      March sales numbers in Taiwan are out. As a reminder Taiwan covers 95% of Gogoro's revenue currently. This year Gogoro exceptionally launched new scooters in January (Pulse) and February (JEGO) so the comparison is not straight forward to last year. Considering actual orders instead of deliveries Gogoro has established +27% growth in Q1.      YTD 2024 sales 7,321 scooters (last year 10,593).   However, a big bunch of scooters have been ordered but not yet delivered (not in stats):   \- Pulse pre-orders: 1,400 (25 units in March numbers, 90% most expensive model)   \- JEGO pre-orders: 5,300 (577 mostly trial vehicles in March stats).      ***Actual orders in Q1: 13,419 (+27% compared to last year).***      A quick analysis of sales: Gogoro exceeded Q1 orders compared to last year, a positive development. However, reported Q1 numbers might appear lower due to deliveries scheduled for Q2. Nonetheless, expectations are for strong Q2 figures. Hopefully, Taiwan sales maintain their growth trajectory throughout 2024, with anticipated positive news from international markets.     **Product Launch Analysis - JEGO and Pulse**      I've been hoping for Gogoro to replicate what Apple did with the iPhone SE—an affordable option with great specs that appeals to cost-conscious consumers, while still maintaining premium flagship products. This parallels the Pulse vs. JEGO product positioning.      It's noteworthy that JEGO garnered 5,300 orders in a month, especially when considering the broader 2023 sales per model. This indicates significant potential, provided sales continue on their current trajectory and Viva orders remain stable.      Pulse has received 1,400 orders already and there is a lot of hype in the air as it's clearly the best EV in the market in its class. Reviews have been good and what comes to sales it will be interesting to follow how SuperSport sales figures will be impacted in the future.      *Top 10 electric motorcycle sales in 2023 (Taiwan)*      Ranking | car model | sales volume | Market share (%)   1| Gogoro Viva Mix | 16422 | 20.6   2| Gogoro Viva | 9994 | 12.6   3| Gogoro Delight | 9358 | 11.8   4| Gogoro Viva XL | 7322 | 9.2   5| Gogoro SuperSport | 6810 | 8.6   6| Gogoro Premium/2 Series | 6322 | 7.9   7| Ionex i-One Air | 4180 | 5.3   8| Ionex i-One Fly | 3274 | 4.1   9| Aeonmotor Ai-1 Sport | 2032 | 2.6   10| Ionex i-One | 1594 | 2  **International Recognition**      March 19: Gogoro Named by Fast Company as Asia-Pacific’s #1 Most Innovative Company of 2024 and #37 Most Innovative Company Globally.      Fast Company is a highly respected publication, and this award further underscores Gogoro's recent recognition (Oct 4, 2023) by the MIT Technology Review, affirming its status as an innovative company and a key player in climate technology worth monitoring.      [https://www.gogoro.com/news/fast-company-2024/](https://www.gogoro.com/news/fast-company-2024/)  **Gogoro Partner News**      March 15: Zypp Electric achieved the remarkable distinction of being named the top-ranked company in the Financial Times and Statista's annual ranking of high-growth Asia-Pacific companies – an incredible accomplishment!      With Gogoro's leadership, Zypp secured $25 million in Series B funding and solidified its position as Gogoro's strategic partner in India. They have recently placed orders for the first batches of locally manufactured scooters in their B2B fleet. I'm eagerly anticipating further orders as the battery swapping network expands and Zypp continues to extend its presence.      [https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024](https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024)  April 3: Zypp Electric posts 3x revenue growth in FY24 and is now operationally profitable. Zypp is Gogoro's major partner in India so it's absolutely great news.      ""On the fleet front, we intend to grow our current strength of 20,000 to around 100,000 vehicles in the next 12 to 18 months and then grow that to 500,000 over the following 36 to 48 months.""

Gogoro has plenty of potential in Taiwan and government continues provide considerable subsidies.   \- India: government has raised EV charging ecosystem support in one of their main goal in the near future.   \- South Korea: subsidies to EVs available.   \- The Philippines: Executive Order 12 defines that EV vehicles tariff fee is 0% instead of 30%. Two-wheelers are not included but there is a EO 12 yearly review ongoing to remove the tax from two-wheelers as well. Basically all relevant parties support the amendment and it is likely to happen in the coming months. In practise it would mean that Gogoro scooter resale prices would drop about 30% in the country and boost EV adoption.      **Gogoro's Key Metrics and Good to Know**      \- Best battery swapping product/services in the market.   \- Company has $173.9 million cash balance and they are controlling costs efficiently.   \- Gogoro has invested $650-$700 million to Taiwan's battery swapping network.   \- Sticky and growing subscriber base generating significant amount revenue. Number of subscribers at the end of Q4/2023 was 587,000, so pre-orders included the subscriber is now close to 600,000.   \- 95% of revenue from Taiwan currently. Goal is to increase international revenue to 10% this year (main focus in India).      **Battery Swapping Network**      \- Over 1,3 million batteries in circulation.   \- Taiwan: 13501 racks in 2584 locations.   \- South Korea: estimated 600 racks in 200 locations.   \- India: getting started in Delhi. 75 racks in 25 locations.
